</p><p>Ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> raided the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse myths</a> for good stuff, dozens of fantasy worlds have included them... and most of them have stuck closely to the original. Tolkien's importance to this can be gauged by the fact that the plural form <em>dwarves</em>, which he used to distinguish his dwarves from other dwarfs, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dztw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dztw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dztw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was originally a recurring mistake during the writing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> (or rather "a private piece of bad grammar" that sneaked into the text), but it quickly became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">Ascended Glitch</a>.</span> is now regarded by many as the standard plural (at least regarding fantasy — "dwarfs" is still the accepted plural for humans with dwarfism). Fantasy writers who use "dwarfs", like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, are now the unusual ones. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gb26');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1gb26" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gb26');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There is a small group that contends that the proper plural should be "dwarrows" or "dwerrows", reconstructed modern English forms of Old English <em>dweorgas</em> or <em>dweorhas</em>, in turn the plural of <em>dweorg</em> or <em>dweorh</em>, from which <em>dwarf</em> evolved (compare Old Norse <em>dverg</em> and <em>dvergar</em>). Tolkien was the first to suggest this, likening it to "man/men" and "goose/geese", but thought it was too archaic. Within this small group, some also use "dwarrow" or "dwerrow", singular.</span> (Many "Tolkienesque" dwarves, however, are more like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion">Theme Park Version</a>.) Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a>(s), they now even all talk the same. A lot of dwarves are Scottish or have some other accent that reads as rustic to English speakers - Northern or south-western English, Welsh,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2osmb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2osmb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2osmb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> John Rhys-Davies, who played archetypal dwarf Gimli in the LOTR films, is Welsh. Stephen Briggs, who does the Discworld audiobooks, also gives many of them Welsh accents, as they often come from Llamedos, Discworld Wales.</span> Irish, or Russian accents are common. Oddly, despite the strong Norse influence, dwarves with any sort of Scandinavian accent are extremely rare. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">entire race</a> of miners and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith">blacksmiths</a>, with names like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeNounverber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeNounverber">Dwarfaxe Dwarfbeard and Grimli Stonesack</a>, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">overly sensitive about any perceived slight</a>, always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentGlaswegian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentGlaswegian">spoiling for a fight</a>, unable to speak two sentences in a row without calling someone "lad" or "lass," and possessed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldFever">a love of gold and jewels</a> that drives them to live in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity">Underground Cities</a> where they dig deep and greedily (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep">often with catastrophic results</a>).

Their societies tend strongly toward a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> (usually a warrior king) ruling over a socially conservative but rather egalitarian society of soldiers, miners, and craftsmen. In most settings, dwarves and humans have enough in common to treat each other with respect. They are frequently allies against outside threats.
</p><p>The dwarf will often serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> (ironic, considering their stature) of a fantasy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a>, especially since his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a> tends to be either an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axe</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">hammer</a>. Ranged combat is not their preference, but if they aren't able to force enemies into close quarters, you can expect guns (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">Fantasy Gun Control</a> permitting), throwing axes, or crossbows - in about that order. Dwarf rogues are rather uncommon in fiction, as their stocky frames make sneaking around look unconvincing, and their culture values honesty and openness; however dwarfs will usually know a thing or two about brawling and fighting dirty, which overlaps with the rogue archetype. Likewise, dwarven mages are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass">vanishingly rare</a>. In fact, it's not uncommon for the entire race to be at least somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">magic-resistant</a>. If a dwarf wants to use magic, he'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalWeapon">infuse it into a sword or an axe</a> so he can physically beat the enemy with it instead. If legends speak of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">Ultimate Blacksmith</a> from a bygone age who once forged all manner of powerful enchanted weapons and equipment, then he was probably a dwarf. If you happen to come across any of this legendary equipment and discover that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcaliburInTheRust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcaliburInTheRust">the centuries haven't been very kind to it</a>, then the only guy in the world who can help you get it back into fighting shape is probably a dwarf too.

And in contrast to elves (which are generally treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">universally androgynous</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">bisexual</a>), dwarves are almost always portrayed as heterosexual, uninterested in sex with non-dwarves (there's a reason that half-elves are a stock fantasy race and half-dwarves are not), and possibly even uninterested in sex for non-reproductive purposes. Female dwarves might occassionally be portrayed as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbian</a>, and the few homosexual male dwarves in fiction are typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay">Manly Gay</a>.
</p><p>An exception to this rule is the fantasy setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutesyDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutesyDwarf">Cutesy Dwarf</a>, who is often based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em>; this variety shares traits with our kind of Dwarves, but will be less of a tough guy and more of a charming man-child, and will scrap the ale-drinking and ax-wielding to focus on craft and mining.

<ul><li> The sequel, <em>Chronicles of the Heroic Knight</em>, introduced a dwarf priest named Father Greevas, who subverted the trope by being quiet, gentle, and fatherly, with a bowl-cut and goatee instead of the standard bushy beard.
</li></ul></li><li> Kiryu's <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Infernity_Dwarf">Infernity Dwarf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> is, other than the fact that he's a Dark Monster, pretty much a dwarf. (The burning axe was added for the card game version later.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OutbreakCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OutbreakCompany">Outbreak Company</a></em>, male dwarves follow the stock-standard dwarf image... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult">from the time they're born</a>, making it impossible for humans to tell dwarven children from adults. Female dwarves, on the other hand, are capable of passing as human children. Both are significantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">stronger</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">tougher</a> than humans.
</li><li> Most Dwarfs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsItWrongToTryToPickUpGirlsInADungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsItWrongToTryToPickUpGirlsInADungeon">Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?</a></em> fit the usual dwarf archetype, but strangely many of the dwarfs to play a major role within the series are much taller than average in spite of dwarfs supposedly being shorter. Dormul is roughly average height for a Japanese man and Mia would be an unusually tall HUMAN woman. Tsubaki Collbrande, meanwhile, can be excused for being taller than average by virtue of being only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-dwarf</a>, although she's still tall for a woman.
</li><li> It's heavily implied that dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> largely fit the usual stereotype (smithing, fighting, mining, straightforward). Senshi, the main dwarf of the series, is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass">a very atypical dwarf</a>, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureHero">Nature Hero</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">Supreme Chef</a>, who can handle himself in a fight but prefers peace first, and admits to not knowing the first thing about ores. He inherited a pair of priceless, heirloom adamantine shields from his companions — and reforged them into a wok with a matching lid. He has a mithril <em>cooking knife</em>. Nonetheless, he still has a few traditional dwarven elements in him, such as a distrust of magic and favoring an axe.

On one hand they're smiths, very strong, prideful, stubborn and distrustful of elves. But on the other hand they can grow the size of a human, and females prefer to act from the shadows.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> dwarves are a race from long ago that had special powers like elves, and were short miners who wielded axes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charmy is revealed to be half-dwarf.</span>

R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> are basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Makers</a> of this in modern fantasy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">his version zig-zags the trope</a>:
<ul><li> The Dwarvish language of Khuzdul was constructed along the lines of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages">Semitic languages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; none of them ever speak with a Scottish or Welsh accent at all.
</li><li> Like the stereotype, Dwarves are redoubtable warriors and master craftsmen with a love of gems who live underground. Interestingly, though the ones from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> have names taken from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Poetic Edda</a></em>, Tolkien later stated that these Nordic names are actually just "outer" names used when interacting with non-Dwarves, with their real Khuzdul names being more along the lines of something like "Azaghâl" or "Mîm".
</li><li> In spite of their Norse roots, when you combine the quasi-Semitic language with their lost homeland and usual status as a minority in lands ruled by other races, many writers (including Tolkien himself) have considered them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">analogues to the Jews</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> reveals that dwarves are a somewhat unnatural race, having been created by Aulë, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Valar</a> — not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Eru</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">Ilúvatar</a> himself, who made the other "good" races like elves, humans and hobbits.

</li><li> Although Gimli and many other dwarves use axes, others use a variety of weapons, including swords and bows.
</li><li> In <em>The Hobbit</em>, it's a subtle running joke that the dwarves in the Company are so interchangeable that even Bilbo rarely bothers to differentiate them beyond Thorin and Bombur.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> features dwarfs, who are divided in two types: red and black dwarfs (referring to the color of their hair). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors">"red dwarfs"</a> are usually good-natured (if often grumpy), while most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors">"black dwarfs"</a> are ruthless, greedy, traitorous bastards. Eleven black dwarfs eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">renounce Aslan's existence</a>, and are punished with being blind/insane and abandoned to grovel away at each other (they are, of course, Lewis's allegory for atheists). Both types of dwarfs are skilled craftsmen (the narrator mentions that while there are evil dwarfs, there are no stupid ones - though see below) and in contrast to the usual dwarven preference for axes, Narnian dwarfs are deadly archers instead.
<ul><li> The Dufflepuds encountered in the <em>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em> were once very stupid dwarfs before being punished by being transformed into monopods (hence the name).
</li></ul></li><li> A brief mention in <em>Gnomes</em> by Wil Huygen and Rein Poortvliet. Quote: "An almost extinct species of the male sex." (Could there be a connection there?) "Height 1 metre 20 cm, often smaller. Can still be found in the middle of inhospitable forests and in the mountains. They dig for gold and silver in extensive mines; they are masters of metalwork. They are good-natured except for a solitary few who are capable of ugly deeds. If a dwarf falls into human hands, he buys his freedom with gold. They do not have beards."
</li><li> Likely influenced by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> the dwarves that appear in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaymondEFeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaymondEFeist">Raymond E. Feist</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">Riftwar Cycle</a></em> follow this trope.
</li><li> Meredith Ann Pierce had no problem with "dwarrows" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkangelTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkangelTrilogy">The Darkangel Trilogy</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantasySpelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantasySpelling">duaroughs</a> (yes, that's basically pronounced "dwarves") are basically Tolkienian, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">sunlight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">temporarily turns them to stone</a>, forcing them to wear heavy, enveloping garments if they go above ground during the daytime.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods">Bahzell</a> trilogy has dwarves. Heavy emphasis on mining and living underground, technology better than anyone else's, and an absurd emphasis on family and clan that no other race can even follow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> plays with the trope (when doesn't it?)—wherefore see a partly overlapping discussion in the Literature folder under "Parodies and radically different versions" below—by having this as the traditional Dwarven image that most Dwarfs aspire to, but many were born and raised in cities and work in factories.
<ul><li> This is partly a parody of the way that an ethnic group will rhapsodise the old country more as they get further away from it. No-one in Scotland habitually wears tartan, for instance. Thus, it's noted that dwarfs who led quiet and respectable lives in the mountain mines reach Ankh-Morpork and are seized by a compulsion to dress in armour, carry battle-axes and drink like crazy.
</li><li> Further, extremely fundamentalist dwarfs attempt to never emerge above ground. If they're ever forced to, they wear garments that completely envelop them so they don't have to look at sunlight; the in-story explanation for the outfit, aside from the fact that they abhor sunlight because of beliefs established in their folklore, is that it's a ceremonial version of the protective clothing worn by dwarfs who do the important but extremely deadly job of dealing with gas pockets in mines; originally, the dwarfs who occupied this position in society would have been members of this profession who survived long enough to retire.
<ul><li> Though, when you catch that the headgear comes to a point, you see a nice allusion to Klan-wear. Especially when one of the deep-dwellers likes to give speeches on how it isn't murder if its a troll.
</li></ul></li><li> Pratchett also subverts the trope with dwarf characters such as Casanunda, the world's second greatest lover (We Try Harder), and Hwel, the Discworld Shakespeare. Also Carrot, the seven-foot dwarf (by adoption), and the openly female Cheery/Cheri Littlebottom.
</li><li> Discworld Dwarves take the "Females have beards" thing even further. All Dwarves are considered male unless otherwise specified. And they only specify otherwise to their spouse, and even then only after a lengthy courtship (as in decades). For Cheri to act and dress openly female on duty is like a human police officer turning up to work in lingerie. And even in her case, "act and dress openly female" mainly means putting rhinestones on her axe holster, wearing a sensible leather skirt and high-heeled iron boots, and grooming her beard differently.
</li><li> Also, a nod to the 'craftsman' stereotype in that they are good at <em>any</em> craft. Mostly the typical metalworking and stoneworking, but they are very good at anything. In particular they are as good at <em>baking</em> as they are at metalwork and stonecarving. However, their bakery is mostly good for weaponry. They grind down rocks to make the flour. The best way to enjoy Dwarfbread is to keep it uneaten, so that <em>any</em> other food will taste good by comparison. The "Scottish" stereotype is brought up here as the Low King (low being better than high for a mining people) of the Dwarves being crowned on the Scone of Stone. In Scotland, Kings were always crowned on a giant stone called the <em>Stone of Scone</em> (pronounced Skoon) because it was held in Scone Abbey, Perthshire. They also practically monopolize the cosmetics industry, most likely because they have real chemistry instead of alchemy.
</li><li> Dwarf folklore is an interesting deviation; it holds that dwarfs and trolls are diametric opposites and will forever hate each other.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note334dd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note334dd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note334dd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It seems to have started out as a gag - one race are rock miners, the other are sentient rocks, <em>of course</em> they have an awkward relationship - but got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">Cerebus Retcon</a> as Pratchett developed the idea.</span><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em> takes it a step further by introducing what may be the oldest of dwarf folklore, the story of the creation of dwarf, man, and troll. The story goes that Tak, a very laid-back not-quite-deity ("Tak doesn't require that we think of Him, only that we think") created a stone egg in a cave, which hatched and released two brothers; one left the cave and found the things that made him man, while the other ventured deeper within and found the things that made him dwarf. Then, unbeknownst to Tak, the stone egg came to life and became a troll, but without Tak's blessing, it was an agonized half-life, without thought, creation, or virtue, such that killing it is not murder, but mercy (the citation when this story is first told mentions that in the original document, the passage about trolls appears to have been added later by a second author). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later, we're given a new version of the troll passage; Tak <em>did</em> notice the egg trying to come to life, and he was overjoyed by it, giving it the last little push it needed to become a troll (this one was recited by a pair of diplomats trying to establish peace between trolls and dwarfs, and insofar as either version belongs with the rest of the story, this is probably the one, considering the book's message)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Dwarves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> are polytheistic and devoutly religious people who pretty much play the trope straight in all other respects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPaolini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPaolini">Paolini</a> makes a point of mentioning dwarf women, but doesn't detail much about how they differ from dwarf men. They have some cities underground, but also some aboveground, even with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> when Eragon is surprised to find that Dwarves have open surface cities just like everyone else, and a dwarf tells him that they like the open air as much as anyone else. They also have seven toes, and two dwarves hold a bet on whether or not humans actually have only five toes. According to history, they are the oldest of sentient races, and lived in Alagaesia before the elves or humans arrived. Interestingly, when Eragon asks Orik how dwarves know the language of humans, Orik reveals that the [[commonTongue]] is actually the dwarven language.
</li><li> The dwarves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyGavrielKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyGavrielKay">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFionavarTapestry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFionavarTapestry">The Fionavar Tapestry</a></em> pretty much fit the mould except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>, and the one dwarven main character being more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>. Dwarf women in Fionavar are sylph-like and graceful; as one character admits to herself, she should no more reasonably expect them to look like their men any more than she herself resembles her male companions.
</li><li> Kage Baker may have slightly different dwarves in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCompanyNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCompanyNovels">Company</a>" series, although they are more a subspecies (or rare parent species??) of humans. They are partway between Tolkien-standard elves and Tolkien-standard dwarves: small, cranky, subterranean, and complete geniuses of invention; but pale, shy, and weak.
</li><li> The dwarves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APracticalGuideToEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APracticalGuideToEvil">A Practical Guide To Evil</a></em>, rather than a dwindling remnant, are depicted at the height of their power with an empire that spans the entire continent of Calernia beneath the surface. All of their traditional negative traits are amplified - they believe that no one but a dwarf can actually own property and so dwarves travelling the surface customarily steal everything that isn't nailed down, with surface dwellers generally too fearful of the power of the Kingdom Under to object, due to their habit destroying entire surface cities when vexed. They also lay claim to all the mineral wealth on the continent below a certain depth, regardless of whether or not they are actually mining it at the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle">The Death Gate Cycle</a></em>, on the world of Pryan, Dwarves are played straight. On Chelestra, they're less xenophobic and more friendly, especially in regards to other races. And on Arianus, they live in devotion to something called the Kicksey-Winsey Machine, which their entire lives revolve around. They're dead on Abarrach (where they are primarily remembered as the mortal race that survived longest in that miserable realm.)
</li><li> Dwarves in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books at least follow the blunt-speaking and stolid parts, which caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity To Ensue</a> when Gilderoy Lockhart hired a bunch of surly dwarves for Valentine's Day in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Chamber of Secrets</a></em>. Lockhart dressed them up like cupids and set them up working as letter-carriers, which they did not seem to enjoy and nor did anyone else, least of all the other teachers. However, that's the only major appearance of dwarves in the entire series.
<ul><li> It is also said Harry spotted a few raucous dwarves in the Leaky Cauldron tavern, so they probably have the drinking down as well.

The Qanuc are actually referred to as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTrollsAreDifferent">Trolls</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">borrow many aspects</a> of Inuit culture while living in snowy mountains and taming sheep for mounts. They do brew a mean liquor, though. On the other hand, the branch of the Tinukeda'ya that went underground became known as Dwarrows — superb stonemasons and crafters, they were once the artisans of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Sithi</a> and helped build many of their great cities, but had a falling out over their treatment as little more than slaves.

The only other dwarf met in the series is a veteran turned unscrupulous merchant. Dwarves were once enslaved by the Empire and brought to it from across the sea, resulting in a a racial claustrophobia of being inside ships. Due to the racial habit of chewing crute, a metal infused spice, most Dawrves are literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, or at least their bones are.

However, the only really prominent one, Tyrion Lannister, manages to nail most of the traits pretty well. He fights surprisingly fiercely with axes and crossbows, grows something you could call a beard, makes a big deal about Casterly Rock and its gold mines being his rightful inheritance, drinks heavily, has trouble controlling his temper, holds grudges like nobody else, mistakes a female dwarf for a male one, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">gets snuck past the wall of a merchant's mansion in a barrel</a>...

Theyre short and squat but ferociously strong, bearded and hairy. Theyre skilled craftsmen and badass warriors, but also very greedy, insular and suspicious of outsiders. And top things, the in-universe author implies they might not even be human, since they cannot produce fertile offspring with people from other nations.

Short, broad and muscled, have a high tendency to be blacksmiths.

<ul><li> They do have a few notable differences from the norm. Sure, they're skilled craftsmen, but in this world that speciality goes to the gnomes. Dwarves are known to be shrewd and cunning businessmen, and many prominent Dwarven characters are bankers. There's also a law firm run by Dwarves that specialised in winning cases by making witnesses disappear and arranging mysterious 'accidents' for the enemies of its clients.

He later explains that he's caught in the fantasy cliche and doesn't even like mining but he's a dwarf and that's what they do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonsAndDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonsAndDwarves">The Dwarves of Whiskey Island</a></em>, the titular dwarves are pretty standard flavor; they give the accent, horned helmets, and axes a miss, but keep all the other standard traits.
</li><li> Somewhere between the Norse myths <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">making</a> and Tolkien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">codifying the trope</a>, there are the seven dwarfs from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a>", who are mentioned to be ore miners in the Grimms' fairy tale. They don't live in their mine, though. It is merely their working place, and the dwarfs leaving Snow White alone at their living place (a dwarf-sized, but otherwise presumably ordinary house) every day is a major plot point.
</li><li> Very very averted in Andy Remic's <em>The Blood Dragon Empire</em> series where the Harborym Dwarves, while physically the standard Fantasy Dwarf, have some very big cultural differences from the standard mould. Firstly their religion is called the Church of Hate, that in itself speaks volumes. They do practice mining and consider it an important job, but not really that much more important than other jobs. The biggest difference however is that they enslave humans, torture them for entertainment, and treat them as disposable miners, food for their captive Dragons, or sex slaves. Each of the Dwarf characters in the series is either evil or just uncaring; the main Dwarf character is a twisted and spiteful hunchback who tortures innocent people because he can and forces young female Dwarfs into his bed, another is a rapist with a fetish for human women, another is a torturer whose sheer sadism would impress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstLaw">Sand dan Glokta</a>, and another is a King quite prepared to have families murdered to tie up loose ends and who believes that he is a God. Additionally, outside of a hardcore few, the Harborym Dwarves don't have the fanatical courage typical of the standard dwarf. They're a lyin', cheatin' bunch of cowardly bullies who whimper and grovel once their victims start kicking their asses.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> — here's where it all started.
<ul><li> Though they were somewhat varied, the basics of common lore go back to this mythology. The long beards, the skill in metallurgy, the living in caves, etc. They also turned to stone (sometimes temporarily, sometimes not) when exposed to sunlight. There was also discrepancy concerning how long they lived. Some myths had them be an adult at three years old and an old man by nine, some myths had them always looking old but being immortal. They had coal-black hair, extremely pale skin, were actually a type of elf (no, Skyrim did not originate that idea) and were human-sized at first, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> changed them a lot even during the Viking era. By the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges">Middle Ages</a>, they were much closer to the dwarves we'd recognize today. In Norse Mythology, dwarves were originally endoparasites. Like <em>tapeworms</em>, living in the intestines of some of the first giants.
</li><li> In one version, they first appeared as maggots in the corpse of Ymir, whose body was then made to form the Earth itself. In this light, the stated origin for the dwarves seems an appropriate metaphor, what with their penchant for tunneling and living beneath the surface of the Earth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>' use of the Norse Mythos (via the super-hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a>) has Dwarves that look like the modern model but otherwise are more like their ancient inspiration. In effect, they are cave-dwelling magical gadgeteers.
<ul><li> On that note, Eitri's depiction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em> is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>, as nothing in the original myths stated that the dwarves were actually, physically short. It has been implied that their 'shorter stature' simply meant 'lesser in power to the gods', and that the image of them being shorter and stouter than a human was brought about when Christianity came along.
</li></ul></li><li> Tapeworms aside, it should be mentioned that they usually appeared as cave-dwellers forging weapons and jewelry. Sometimes with remarkable results. It was cave-dwelling dwarves who made Þór's hammer (always hits, destroys its target, returns to the user), Óðinn's spear (always hits its target), Freyja's necklace (shining like the sun), and the nine golden rings (give birth to new rings). Thus the legend of the stunted master forgers in the mountains was born.
</li><li> Experts in Germanic mythology actually believe dwarves began as chthonic <em>death</em> related spirits, which makes the maggot origins and synonimity with the dark elves all the more evident.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Pinballs </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> the Dwarf comes complete with horned Viking helm and long hair.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> — not surprising, given how much it was originally based on Tolkien. There's other differences as well.
<ul><li> One widely used <em>D&amp;D</em> addition is the idea that Dwarves are inherently more resistant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">magic</a>, being that they're all stolid and stony like the earth and all. Yet in the original myths, dwarves produced all manner of magical artifacts for the Aesir. Even Tolkien's dwarves managed to make mithril, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Unobtainium</a>. That said, they were resistant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a>, seemingly because they love gold and cunning more than they love power. Didn't stop them from making and using magical weapons and armor either. Just made them resistant to wizard spells.
</li><li> Interestingly, the <em>Races of Stone</em> Supplement for 3.5 provides a special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> that allows the casting of spells in armor, providing a description that's best summed up as "Nobody thinks there's any Dwarven Wizards because they wear Armor like the rest of the Dwarves." Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">this is still entirely fitting with this trope</a>.
</li><li> <em>D&amp;D</em> has shown an interesting evolution in the question of Dwarven females — namely, the lore about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsWithMoustaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsWithMoustaches">whether or not they sport beards</a>. Throughout the 80s, the question on whether or not this was true raged in the pages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a> — especially when issue #58 introduced the first iteration of the Morndinsamman, the dwarven racial pantheon, complete with a bearded mother-goddess in Berronar Truesilver. However, its actual canonicity in the first editions of D&amp;D are... questionable. Both the Dungeon Master's Guide for AD&amp;D 1st edition and the Player's Handbook for the 1983 "Red Box" of BECMI Revised mention bearded dwarf women in passing, which are the earliest known such references. However, the AD&amp;D Player's Handbook and Monster Manual made no such references, and the lore was removed from the subsequent 2ed Dungeon Master's Guide and the Rules Compendium for BECMI. In the late 2nd edition sourcebook "The Complete Book of Dwarves", it's mentioned in a single line that dwarf women can grow beards, but only the Deep Dwarf women tend to not shave them off. In 3rd edition, the idea was just quietly dropped and never referenced. In the sourcebook "Wizards Presents: Races &amp; Classes", a design teaser for 4th edition, Wizards of the Coast stated emphatically that bearded dwarf women would not be a thing in that edition. Then in 5th edition, a sidebar in the Player's Handbook would mentioned bearded dwarf women as a possible "non-binary gender expression", alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">androgynous</a> or truly gender-fluid elves... unlike the latter, though, bearded dwarf women have made no appearances in canon.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> were the first D&amp;D setting to make the idea of D&amp;D dwarf women having beards be mainstream. The sourcebook "Dwarves Deep" would establish that Faerunian dwarf women are capable of growing beards, but most prefer to shave. This would be reinforced by the sourcebook "Demihuman Deities", which would explicitly state that all dwarf goddesses are bearded and show at least one bearded goddess. Novels set in the setting that released in the 80s through 90s also mention bearded dwarf women in passing. In post-2nd edition versions of the setting, this lore was quietly dropped.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a></em>, apart from the aforementioned "Red Box", no mention of dwarf women being bearded ever appears. Indeed, the Mystara dwarf sourcebook, "The Dwarves of Rockhome", almost pointedly goes out of its way to <em>not</em> mention the idea, with all of its female dwarf art depicting them as clean-shaven.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>, dwarf women do not grow beards, apart from the degenerate Aghar, or gully dwarves. And even then, women do not grow beards so much as "hairy cheeks", which are implied to be basically overgrown sideburns.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NentirVale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NentirVale">Nentir Vale</a></em>, because it was built to be integrated into 4th edition, dwarf women lack beards and never had beards. In fact, a subrace of elementally tainted dwarves, called the Forgeborn, are naturally hairless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em>, all dwarves are completely hairless, so not only are dwarf women in that setting non-bearded, they're actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen">Bald Women</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Dwarves are noted as being good with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">Divine magic</a>, and they're one of the go-to races for Clerics. (see: Durkon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> for an example). Players and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Masters</a>, of course, can play with or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">subvert the definition</a> all they wish.
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> — the setting that brought you good undead, necromancer elves, intelligent giants (granted that's ancient history), removed alignment restrictions, among other things — cannot escape this. Its dwarves are the same, with the exception of House Kundarak who are bankers instead of smiths or miners. Though if <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebee/20050704a">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGOd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGOd">by Keith Baker himself</a> is to be believed, the Neogi (who look like a cross between a wolf spider and a moray eel) were actually formerly dwarves altered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Daelkyr</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfRaces">dazzling</a> level of diversity and details <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts</a> this trope a few times with sub-races like the wild dwarves and arctic dwarves, plus Gray Dwarves (duergar). Shield dwarves and gold dwarves are closer to the stereotype, as a beard-combing grimly determined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> is never too far. Gold dwarves tend to be tradition-bound, suspicious, greedy, obscenely rich and almost as haughty as elves, though trade with humans and other folk a lot. Shield dwarves are split. Some are "The Hidden", isolationist clans. Most are "The Wanderers" who got a clue from all those empty clanholds that dwarves aren't too far from extinction, and see interacting with the world proactively as their duty. These are borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> sorts, allying with anyone up to elves and half-orcs if necessary, adventuring, working as smiths in non-dwarven cities. They are fairly traditional, but marry whoever they like including humans, gnomes or halflings instead of checking exact age, social status and opinions of all elders in both clans before starting a family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> played with the trope a bit. They had the Hylar, Niedhar, and Daewar clans of dwarves, all of which were in the general neighborhood of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a>, and the Daergar, who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a></em> uses this trope 100% straight with its Rockhome dwarves, then subverts it with their Kogolor predecessors, who lived above ground and mostly raised goats for a living.
<ul><li> The classic supplement <em>The Dwarves of Rockhome</em> goes out of its way to justify the trope by explaining the modern dwarves' backstory, which they themselves don't generally know: after the Blackmoor civilization accidentally wiped itself out in a quasi-nuclear cataclysm that tilted the very axis of the planet, the Immortal Kagyar — not so coincidentally the patron of craftsmen — took some of the few surviving Kogolors and turned them into a new race highly resistant to poison and radiation (and incidentally magic as well) and a predilection for living underground, so that even if a similar disaster should strike the world again, dwarven culture and its achievements would be able to survive in spite of it. Thus, dwarven underground cities essentially serve double duty as potential <em>fallout shelters</em> for their inhabitants.
</li><li> It also plays with the idea that dwarves are always craftsmen by including a clan of dwarf <em>farmers</em>, descended from criminals who'd been sentenced to the "humiliating" task of growing food. The Wyrwarfs, tired of being treated like riffraff, voiced their discontent by threatening to withhold food from the other clans: if the clans refused to acknowledge farmers as equal to miners and artisans, they could huddle down deep with their trinkets and eat rocks.
</li></ul></li><li> The largely forgotten <em>Chainmail</em> D&amp;D Miniatures game (the early 2000s relaunch, not the classic '60s version that inspired <em>D&amp;D</em>) ended up using pretty standard <em>D&amp;D</em> dwarves, but oh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>. The original design specs called for a dwarf faction that had deposed their king, abandoned faith in their god, and become communist factory workers and miners. The Dwarves would have dressed like something out of a '30s era Soviet propaganda poster and built mecha golems.
</li><li> Just like elves, dwarves in <em>D&amp;D</em> have a subterranean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>: the Duergar, or Gray Dwarves, who are built on the folktales of dwarves as nasty schemers with supernatural powers. The Duergar have limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> and have a grim, humorless society based around slave labor and constant toil.
</li><li> Fifth Edition hammers the trope a little harder by giving dwarven characters automatic proficiency with hammers, axes, and the player's choice of metalsmithing, stonemason, or brewing tools. So Monks or Rogue are likely to be the only classes that see a dwarf not running around with such weapons since the class features don't really use either very well. On top of that, the Mountain Dwarf subrace also gives automatic proficiency with light and medium armors, so in the event that you want to play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass">Mountain Dwarf Wizard</a>, you'll still be wearing a breastplate and holding a battle axe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> Athas's Dwarves play this straight, except for few noticeable differences. They're completely hairless, and they have a tradition of working toward short- and long-term goals that only they know of.
</li><li> The Uvandir of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WickedFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WickedFantasy">Wicked Fantasy</a></em> basically turn the typical dwarf stereotypes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up a notch or three</a> and play it for some mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>. They seem to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>, but the truth is that they're actually genderless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Humanoids</a> psionically shaped from stone — this incidentally makes them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a> because the free Uvandir don't know how to make new ones. They're inherently able to communicate with each other non-verbally, so they hate talking to excess and see it as the mark of a fool, which is why they don't get on so well with other races. They're rude and gruff because they're actually very emotionally sensitive, and are prone to attacks of melancholy so intense they can end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">permanently reverting to stone</a> if they get too depressed, and so they try to avoid forming attachments with the shorter-lived races.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em>: Played about as straight as it comes, though <em>Warhammer</em> Dwarfs are most definitely Dwarfs and not Dwarves. Dwarfs (called <em>Dawi</em> in their own language) are honourable, solid, humourless, conservative beyond imagining and treat <em>everything</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>: a <em>Warhammer</em> dwarf either gives 100% to whatever he's doing, or he's dead. Female Dwarfs in <em>Warhammer</em> are not bearded, despite in-universe rumors to the contrary, but tend to look like plump, braid-haired viking maidens straight out of a Wagner opera; they also make up less than five percent of the Dwarven population, as most Dwarf births are boys. That said, they do have some eccentricities:
<ul><li> Dwarfs don't tend to speak with a Scottish accent, but with a thick Yorkshire accent — the ubiquitous English stereotype of Yorkshiremen being that they are gruff, grumpy mining folk with a strong disdain for soft southerners and their airy-fairy ways (and it is no accident that <em>Warhammer</em>'s Elves speak just like those refined and aristocratic upper-class southerners). The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix">Gotrek &amp; Felix</a></em> novels play with the accent, introducing a Dwarf character whose speech is a comically exaggerated version of a real Scottish brogue. Even the other Dwarfs can't understand him half the time.
</li><li> They take immense pride in their beards, which they grow throughout their lives and never cut unless in penance for some great shame or failure. They are often elaborately braided and decorated, and a Dwarf's social status as he ages is determined by the length of his beard — mature adults are called "Fullbeards", while elders are "Longbeards". Forcibly shaving a Dwarf is one of the greatest insults imaginable. The women, being beardless, instead grow out long, pleated braids that serve the same social function as their brothers' facial hair.
</li><li> Their technological superiority is also notable. These Dwarfs have guns. (No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">Fantasy Gun Control</a> here!) And cannons. And <em>helicopters</em>. And <em>Ironclad submarines.</em> This is in spite of them being so utterly conservative that any widely-used design had to have went through decades of testing and refinement to be considered acceptable (the aforementioned guns still has plenty of Dwarfs grumbling about the troubles with these "new"fanged curios compared to the old reliable crossbows). They also have the "love for alcohol" base covered. They have ale that is so filled with nutrients that they can literally survive on it alone. Bonus points to the fact that they distill their <em>helicopter fuel</em> from it!
</li><li> There's also their most defining trait: Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">Revenge Before Reason</a>. Dwarfs nurse a grudge like a human would nurse a family heirloom — in fact, many dwarf Grudges <em>are</em> family heirlooms, passed down through generations. All dwarfholds keep a big book called the Book of Grudges, and if you ever wrong a dwarf from that hold, they write that wrong down in the book and remember it. Forever. Grudges all have set standards for fulfillment, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">disproportionately</a> high, and Dwarfs will never stop until it is repaid. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Ever</a></em>. Classic example: a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf">White Dwarf</a></em> Dwarf vs. Empire battle report that resulted in heavy casualties for both sides was justified by a backstory that explained why the Dwarfs were attacking: Six years ago, an Empire lord underpaid the Dwarf workers who built the castle by <em>two and a half pennies</em> — as far as the lord (and sane real-life human beings) are concerned, it's simply a matter of a few missing coins, but to the Dwarfs, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">you have cheated them out of money, and for that, you must</a></em> <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">die</a></strong></em>. Common consensus of Dwarf society (only aired by elves and humans when safely out of dwarf earshot) is that they're driving themselves to extinction pursuing centuries-old wrongs.
</li><li> Dwarf tendencies towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> and honour also leads to the quirk of the Slayer. What does a Dwarf do if he or she is shamed or dishonoured (such as failing to uphold a grudge, failing to not treat something as seriously as it should be treated, or producing shoddy work that injures or fails another Dwarf)? They become shamed in the eyes of Dwarf society and become Slayers, walking out into the wilderness with nothing on but a pair of pants and a mohawk to find the biggest, meanest beasties <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">and hopefully die trying to kill them</a>. Some of the most (or <em>least</em>) successful Slayers are veteran warriors who have killed everything from demonic personifications of primal rage to dragons the length of football pitches. And they do all this because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">honor demands it</a>. The only alternative to being a Slayer is being a submarine crewman: Dwarfs hate and fear water with unrivaled fervor. The majority choose to become Slayers. Yeah.
</li><li> Interestingly, while the individual Dwarf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> is fairly slow (it's the little legs), Dwarf infantry is effectively among the fastest in the game. This is because the game mechanics say that you can't march (read: move at double your normal speed) when there are enemies within 8". Dwarfs, by virtue of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinators</a>, can ignore that rule, and effectively always march. Apart from when they charge. The result is that army of short bearded guys is going to tactically outmaneuver you by landing their gyrocopters 7" behind your lines and so suddenly everyone but your cavalry is being outpaced.
</li><li> In a way this is <strong>not</strong> the case in-universe. To the humans of the Empire, Dwarfs have an extremely conservative and homogeneous culture, but in truth, each Karak has its own unique cultural quirks. The Dwarfs of Barak Varr for instance are actually quite progressive and friendly because their Karak is built into a cliff on the coast as opposed to an isolated mountain, and Barak Varr is a major maritime and trade hub so the dwarfs here interact with other races often; the now-extinct "Norse Dwarfs" of Kraka Drak on the other hand were isolated in Norsca away from the main Dwarf centres in the Old World for thousands of years, and as such not only were they lagging behind technologically but their language and culture were practically unrecognisable to any Dwarf from an Old World Karak, and they were <em>much</em> more grim and warlike because of their constant battles with the forces of Chaos.
</li><li> Finally, there's the <em>Warhammer</em> take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> dwarfs. The Chaos Dwarfs (<em>Dawi-Zharr</em>), a subfaction whose aesthetics were based on ancient Mesopotamia: Diabolical, slave-driving fascists worshipping a Chaos God in the form of a bull, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">led by evil warlocks</a> addicted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>, which gradually turned their bodies to stone. While they've been always been part of the lore, their army list and models were dropped by Games Workshop after 5th edition due to a lack of sales. Chaos Dwarfs still appeared as warmachine crew for Chaos armies in later editions, but sadly missing their traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">magnificent hats</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Do not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">mention their existence</a> to the normal Dwarfs.
</li></ul></li><li> The Forge Fathers in <em>Warpath</em> are space dwarves through and through. A race of miners and industrialists with very advanced technology that decks their soldiers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a> and builds stompy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>. Not much is known about them, though, mostly because they are very secretive and determined.
</li><li> The Dwarfs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingsOfWar">Kings of War</a></em> come in two forms the Dwarfs who are very much Tolkien Dwarves with cannons and badger cavalry. Unlike most Dwarf civilizations who are either declining or staying underground, these Dwarfs take an expansionist path. Then there's their evil counterparts the Abyssal Dwarfs, who have thralls and dwarf mutants in their armies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice">Dragon Dice</a></em> plays it straight with standard, Tolkien inspired dwarves — not surprising for a game from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR">TSR</a> that was significantly inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. They are composed of the elements of earth and fire, have beards, are expert craftsmen and miners, live in the mountains, wield axes, and wear horned helms... Oh, and their cavalry ride on giant lizards and mammoths, just for a change of pace.
</li><li> The now-defunct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageKnight">Mage Knight</a></em> miniatures game had standard Tolkien-y dwarves. All male, all bearded, all craftsmen and miners (some not by choice), and their craftiness led to literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> tech such as Steam (mecha)Golems and steam-powered mounts. There are some differences from the standard model here. They are actually <strong>shorter</strong>-lived than humans, an elderly dwarf being about 30, and they play up the resistance to magic. They were actually forced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> of Atlantis into slavery, mining for magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> because they were immune to the deadly radiation. They joined the Black Powder Rebels in order to free their comrades from this slavery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> has the Wizened, humans who were made to work as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the Gentry's</a> craftsmen and servants. Like dwarves, there's usually something "diminished" about them (sometimes size, sometimes muscle, sometimes social presence), they tend to be cranky (see "diminished social presence"), and they're very, very good with crafts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Winterweir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Winterweir">Winterweir</a></em>'s Bathas are evil sociopathic slavers but still live underground and have an interest in wealth. They also invent things.
</li><li> As a generic system, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> can potentially handle any sort of dwarf — but its writers have mostly stuck to the established standard.
<ul><li> Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSBanestorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSBanestorm">GURPS Banestorm</a></em>, the main official GURPS fantasy setting, are a race of natural artificers and merchants. Most adults have at least one point worth of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem">personal "signature gear"</a>.
</li><li> <em>GURPS Fantasy</em> offers another variant of the same type.
</li><li> In the <em>GURPS</em> predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheFantasyTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheFantasyTrip">The Fantasy Trip</a></em>, dwarves were straight out of the Tolkienian mold. However, some details (mostly concerning dwarf women) were left unspecified, meaning that players could form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">their own conclusions</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BurningWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BurningWheel">Burning Wheel</a></em> not only plays straight dwarf stereotypes but even builds upon the tale of Moria from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> by working an attribute called "Greed" into the rule system: all dwarves are covetous. The higher a dwarf's Greed, the more likely they are to betray others, or even go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, in the pursuit of possessing objects of high value and/or craftsmanship. They get bonuses to rolls made in the pursuit of wealth. However, if the Greed attribute reaches its maximum through indulgence of the vice, the dwarf hides himself away with his hoard of goods in paranoid seclusion, never to be seen again.
</li><li> The Jotun of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewHorizon">New Horizon</a></em> were once compared to dwarves, except being huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">wafans</a> instead of short humans. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Subsequently a group of dwarves raided the forum, decapitated the person who made the claim, and told everybody never to compare them to war machines again</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>: Dwarves come in a couple different varieties, each of which comes from a different dimension. Regular dwarves come out of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PalladiumFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PalladiumFantasy">Palladium Fantasy</a></em> dimension, and exhibit all the classic characteristics, including a deep-seated cultural aversion to magic. <em>Pantheons of the Megaverse</em> has dwarves that represent the dwarves from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, right down to being the creators of Mjölnir. There's also races like the Dwarf Forgemasters from the <em>Three Galaxies</em> setting and the technologically adept and rune magic-using Nuhr Dwarves, but they're all basically variations on a theme. A list that circulates around message boards and other sites called "You Know You've Been Playing <em>Rifts</em> for Too Long When..." has an item in it that reads "You've ever made a Dwarf character whose name did not have 'axe' or 'beard' in it."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eon">Eon</a></em>: Zigzagged. There are four Dwarven clans; Ghor, Roghan, Drezin and Zolod, each with their own culture putting them somewhere on the Straight-to-Subverted spectrum.
<ul><li> Clan Ghor play this trope completely straight, being the most traditional clan who've changed the least since the Dwarven race broke through the surface and entered the world above, to the extent that the clan still mostly live underground and in the mountains. Being the largest clan, the Ghor Dwarves are also responsible for establishing this trope as the in-universe international stereotype of what a Dwarf is like.
</li><li> Clan Roghan play this tope mostly straight and is the clan with the worst relationship to the Elves, though unlike Ghor they have split more with the traditions of old and have integrated more freely with other races.
</li><li> Clan Drezin is where things start veering into stranger territories as while their way of living is almost as traditional as clan Ghor's, they are also a clan far more devoted to arcane studies than your average Dwarf and are also subject to great stigmatization from the other clans... not because of the magic, mind you, the Dwarfs of <em>Eon</em> generally hold great respect for those who can use such awe-inspiring and unpredictable power without blowing themselves up, but rather because the Drezin clan sided with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Tiraks</a> in the last great war, an act which got them branded as traitors by the other Dwarfs. On top of that, Dwarfs of clan Drezin also often shave or trim their beards in order to differentiate themselves from other Dwarfs, instead favoring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache">Badass Mustache</a>.
</li><li> Finally there's clan Zolod, who are generally mocked by the other clans for how untraditional and un-Dwarf-like they are, having almost completely integrated into human society.

His Nibelung dwarves are, true to their Norse roots, subterranean miners and metalcrafters. His dwarven brothers Alberich and Mime inspired the thieving dwarf Mîm who appears in <em>The Silmarillion</em>. Oddly enough they are sometimes referred to as black elves. These legends of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink">all predate Wagner by a fair few centuries</a>. Tolkien was quite adamant his works were not based of Wagner's Operas. The Nibelung are possibly an allegory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews">Jews</a>. Considering Wagner was quite anti-Semitic this is probably right.

The <em>Warlords</em> universe in general plays around with this, in the form of regular dwarves, and Dark Dwarves, playing a somewhat similar role to dark elves. Both are industrious and warlike, but the two are quite different : Regular dwarves are affable, somewhat jolly, love partying enough that they have zero problem going to war drunk, and prefer fighting personally, decking themselves out in heavy armor and carrying magnificent melee weaponry. Dark Dwarves are grim, science-obsessed, disregard nature in the face of progress to the point of resembling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanet">Captain Planet</a></em> villains, and prefer to fight in a more advanced manner than their good cousins, with extremely powerful and advanced siege weaponry and tremendously strong metallic golems.

Females are never seen, so <em>all</em> dwarves are the same; bearded stocky men. Asking about dwarf women is a surefire way to send a male into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">homicidal rage.</a> The "mostly" comes in because it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> 1880s, some dwarves exchange their armor for tailcoats, and dwarves are the most technologically-apt of all the races. Even so, however, this mostly manifests in dwarves being master smiths with an advanced understanding of materials science; traditional dwarves would never use a steam engine to replace the power of their muscles, and therein lies a large part of the game's plot.
</li><li> Two dwarves appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, with one of them being the foster father of the hero, Lloyd Irving. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, which takes place about 4,000 years after <em>Symphonia</em>, dwarves are extinct, though their ruins are intact. A skit mentioned that the majority of the dwarves are hidden by Cruxis somewhere in Derris Kharlan as they use them for maintaining machinery, so they may have still be living on the comet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaceTheDarkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaceTheDarkAge">Mace: The Dark Age</a>,</em> a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Edge</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">style weapons-based 3D fighter</a> for the Nintendo 64, the dwarves are represented by hidden character Gar Gudrunnson. His people are mountain-dwellers enslaved by despotic Lord Deimos (think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Nightmare</a> with his own kingdom) to build his weapons of war. Gar is among a handful of rebels, and his weapon is an enormous steam-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Warmech</a>, ironically making him the largest character in the game and one of the few who are original. He's rather overpowered though, and is more on par with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">sub-boss</a> Grendal due to his enormous strength and the fact that he can't be thrown or Executed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The mace enslaves him and the other dwarves and it motivates them to wage war on mankind</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>'s dwarves, in the Loho mining camp from <em>The Lost Age</em>, probably don't have Scottish accents, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">Funetik Aksent</a> is used for the two humans with Scottish accents but not the dwarves. Additionally, some are historians, which is why the dwarves are in Loho, excavating the ruins there. However, they all have awesome facial hair and a love for digging— "If you live in Loho and don't dig, you just don't belong"— and the only visible female in town is the human innkeeper, so they otherwise fit this trope perfectly.
</li><li> Played mostly straight in Bungie's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a></em> series of fantasy games. Dwarves there are short, construct underground cities, are good with gadgets, greedy, and have chemistry far beyond that of the other races leading to them becoming explosive and demolition experts. However, instead of sounding Scottish, they are voiced to sound more like crabby old men.
</li><li> Two "Dwarven Swordsmiths" appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>. They are the only dwarves to appear in the entire series, and nothing is made of their presence in a village otherwise made up entirely of Hylians.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia">Lusternia</a></em>. The dwarven race were originally called the Clangoru (having descended from the Elder God Clangorum); when the humans arrived in Lusternia from a different dimension, they puzzled everyone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">calling the Clangoru dwarves</a>. They did this because the Clangoru — alone of every other mortal race — were recognisable to the humans, being <em>indistinguishable</em> from the dwarves of their native dimension.
</li><li> Dwarves are a recurring race in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries">Shining Series</a></em>, at least in the older games. They follow the Tolkien/D&amp;D model fairly closely—most dwarves are axe-wielding warriors. A notable exception, though, is that the first dwarf you meet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Luke/Lugh</a>, is young, cheerful, and beardless (but still an axe-wielding warrior). They are not slowed down by hill terrain, which makes them surprisingly mobile.
<ul><li> It's because Luke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">hobbit</a>, Gort is a Dwarven Warrior, but Luke is a hobbit. Jaha in Shining Force II is also a Hobbit, but Gyan and Randolph are Dwarves, funny because Randolph is beardless.
</li></ul></li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> games, this is both played straight and averted. When it's played straight, it's hilarious.
<ul><li> Averted: <em>Neverwinter Nights</em> features the possible henchman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and later a boss in an expansion</span> Grimgnaw. He's a Monk of the Order of the Long Death, which as you can guess from the name, isn't exactly a nice group. He's the only henchman with an Evil alignment, and has a fascination with death that is damn creepy. He isn't loud and boisterous, is bald and has no beard, and doesn't need a giant hammer or axe to kick some serious ass. He loves to send people to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Silent Lord</a>, often in the most violent way possible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, on the other hand, features Khelgar Ironfist, who is a stereotypical dwarf to the extreme, drinking lots of ale without paying, being very loud and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">fantastically racist</a>, and is easily provoked and will start a fight with a group of drunk sailors just because <em>one of them agreed with him.</em> Ironically enough, Khelgar also can become a monk, just like his polar opposite Grimgnaw, a possible reference to NWN1. As with most dwarves, he's not a good fit at all for the class without a lot of nudging, he just knows he likes being able to beat things up with his fists.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfMagic">Master of Magic</a></em> has a fairly stereotypical dwarves: tough, hard-working, good at mining and climbing mountains, but not fond of ships. They also make golems and steam cannons.
</li><li> The Mountain and Hill Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></em> were standard issue. This led to them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>; they were too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringYetPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringYetPractical">Boring Yet Practical</a> and didn't offer any interesting options. Deep Dwarves, described below, are another story altogether.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>, the Dwarves are short, live in mined-out caves, are the major source of ore (aside from the players), are extremely fond of beer and kebabs, and pretty much the only way you can tell it's gender are whether it has a beard and/or helmet or not.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfMana">World of Mana</a></em> series has always included dwarves that fit this mold.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyAdventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a></em>, you eventually meet a colony of dwarves, but they don't do much besides point you in the direction of a product you have to buy to save one of their dwarf friends. Once you do buy it and go on a quest to save him, you will find out that his only "companion" ability is to <em>sell</em> you basic items that you might need to break him out of the dungeon. Once you <em>do</em> get him out and back to the dwarf cave, he thanks you the only way dwarves know how...by <em>selling back to you the items he made out of the silver you risked your life to get him</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em> has Watts, which continues this. He is a dwarf who basically knows that your party is out to save the world, and so he only continues to forge your weapons in exchange for increasingly massive amounts of money. He's probably saving up to buy the entire Gold City, and with his smithing skill, he probably <em>could</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em>, the Dwarves look like a cross between a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Wookie</a> and a teddy bear with glowing eyes, wear Viking-style helmets, and speak like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prospector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prospector">Old West prospectors</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty">Majesty</a></em> has dwarves as one of your recruitable classes. They fall on the smith/engineer side of the scale; their fortresses can only be built once you have a Level 2 Blacksmith in your kingdom. They have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Horny Vikings</a> helmets and are hammer-wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glaciers</a> whose voice lines emphasize how much they love hard work and building things. They're also mutually exclusive with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwarvesVersusElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwarvesVersusElves">Elves</a>, although they won't come to a kingdom with gnomes either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GemsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GemsOfWar">Gems of War</a></em>, the dwarven troops fit the typical image of fantasy dwarves exactly  bearded, grumpy, interested in subterranean wealth acquisition, technologically inclined.
</li><li> Barik from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins">Paladins</a></em> is very much a typical dwarf. Scottish accent, short and muscular, extravagant beard, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster">master engineer</a>. The only thing he doesn't do is fight with an axe, preferring to use a blunderbuss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DelveDeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DelveDeeper">Delve Deeper</a></em>. It's played mostly for laughs, but they're about as generic as it gets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord">Overlord</a></em> deliberately exaggerates all dwarf stereotypes for comedic effect. Drinking, mining gold, hoarding gold, doing something altogether unsanitary to gold, sporting gigantic beards, wielding enormous axes, and harassing elves is basically their entire function. They have even less personality than the elves, which is impressive considering that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">elves spend all their lives bewailing their lot and talking about how awesome they used to be</a>. In fact, the only sound you get from a dwarf is a grunt. Followed by axe swing/flamethrower.
</li><li> In Ghost Ship Games's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeepRockGalactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeepRockGalactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a></em>, the dwarven protagonists are short, have beards reaching their knees, love beer, are really good at engineering and will dive <em>anywhere</em> for valuable ores, including hostile alien planets no one else wants. So even in outer space and carrying miniguns, a dwarf is the same everywhere.

They may slightly diverge as they were driven from the dwarfholds centuries ago, the survivors resettling in more traditional towns all down the Diamond Coast, and they are even know to crew sailing ships (though most don't swim, and their hulls are metal-plated, as you would expect from Dwarf-boats).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em> Dwarves have optional beards on both sexes, no specific accents, aren't all short tempered and have plenty of non-miners, but otherwise fit the mold. A female Dwarf villain, G'nolga, insists that the beauty of dwarf women is legendary. While she and other dwarf females definitely don't look bad, one does wonder how much of this comes from her being acknowledged as one of the ten strongest fighters on the planet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> even thought they're called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">trolls</a>, the trolls are identical in every way (except being green) to stereotypical Dwarves. However Two-Edge, a half-troll half-elf looks identical to a typical dwarf but is bat-shit insane.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CastleWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CastleWaiting">Castle Waiting</a></em>, Hammerlings are short, hairy miners and engineers with much fewer women than men. However, they're considered to be notoriously sneaky and devious, and are widely accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a> to create a market for their magic weapons. This is because <em>Castle Waiting</em> is more influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersGrimm">The Brothers Grimm</a> than Tolkien.

<ul><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> took pains to avert this trope. The dwarves are all short, hairy, and crusty, but they have great variety in their faces, beards, clothing, body types, personalities and weaponry. Particularly notable are Thorin, Fíli, and Kíli, who all benefit from varying degrees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>, with Kíli's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">Perma-Stubble</a> practically making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> by dwarf standards. They also have accents that range throughout Britain, from Scotland to Ireland and Wales. Glóin, the most stereotypical of the dwarves, is the father of Gimli, who is arguably the modern day codifier of the trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em>, a bunch of wicked, sharp-toothed dwarf-like creatures called "dwergi" reassemble Dr. Frankenstein's equipment for Dracula.

<ul><li> <em>Adventurers Wanted</em> features dwarves that mostly fit the standard. Even the women are bearded, A mix of Scottish and Germanic accents, a hard drinking, poison resistant, etc. The one thing that is added is that these dwarves are seafarers. Dwarven raiding parties terrorize the coasts in their long ships as dwarves with dane axes and spectacle helms go I-Viking.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstDwarfKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstDwarfKing">The First Dwarf King</a></em> plays with the standard dwarf model. On one hand, men have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard">wicked-looking beards</a>, dwarves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">can fight with the best of them</a>, and they wield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">warhammers</a> in battle. On the other hand, dwarven women lack facial hair (and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">cute but tough</a>), the entire race is not so much a nation as a loosely-connected country of hunters and farmers, and most (though not all) of the population live above ground, going underground only in times of great need.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretWeis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretWeis">Margaret Weis</a> and Tracy Hickman have tried to avert this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle">The Death Gate Cycle</a></em> was basically about what happens to Tolkienesque races' cultures when put in completely different worlds, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSovereignStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSovereignStone">The Sovereign Stone</a></em> trilogy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">recast them as Mongol-style nomads (the Elves were Japanese</a>). Didn't really work, because the dwarves always got the least characterization, but they tried.
</li><li> Averted comedically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Grailblazers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Grailblazers">Grailblazers</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt">Tom Holt</a>. Toenail the dwarf (brother Hangnail, cousin Chillblain) is about 3 feet tall, clean-shaven, and decidedly <em>not</em> a warrior. He goes and hides in baskets or under tables when trouble threatens. Dwarves in general are servants to the knightly class; they're the ones who clean the floor and polish the armor. They are also extremely clever at solving puzzles, riddles, and crosswords; since they're too short to reach the pool table and too weak to throw darts, that's all they have to do at the pub on their nights off. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4szg4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4szg4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4szg4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is a reference to Mallory's Arthurian lore, where knights were often attended by dwarfs (though it's unclear if Mallory meant people with a genetic condition or actual mythical creatures) </span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara">Shannara</a></em> series has dwarves mutated from human stock (like most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces">the races</a> of the books) but with the added caveat that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">due to their ancestors' millennia of hiding in shelters</a>, they are claustrophobic and dislike going underground. They actually appropriate the typical elven skill in that they are skilled woodsmen, and their crafts are mostly carved from wood rather than stone, and are famous for their gardens and dams.
</li><li> Flint Fireforge, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a> Chronicles</em> trilogy, was originally going to be a well-dressed fop. Eventually, though, they decided against this, and just made him the standard dwarf. The well-dressed fop concept later became the preferred mortal guise of Reorx, god of the forge.
</li><li> The Valerians of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> series are a race of strong, tough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axe-wielding</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">proud warriors</a>, but they're really human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heavyworlder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heavyworlder">Heavyworlders</a>, not fantasy dwarves. Also, the shortest Valerian described stands at above 7ft tall in his stockinged feet.
</li><li> Possible example: Gregory Maguire's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MirrorMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MirrorMirror">Mirror, Mirror</a>,</em> in which the eight (yep) dwarves are, at least initially, shapeshifters. They're also far more, well, <em>mineral</em> than your typical humanoid character.
</li><li> In Adrian Tchaikovsky's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheApt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheApt">Shadows of the Apt</a></em> series Beetle-kinden are essentially clean shaven dwarves in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk">Clock Punk</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> setting. Short, stocky, technological and capitalistic with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace">Collegium beetles</a> emphasizing the tech side and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">the Helleron Beetles</a> emphasizing the capitalist side.
</li><li> The urZrethi of <em>The Dragon Crown War</em> initially appear to be bog-standard dwarves, but are gradually revealed to be quite different. They <em>are</em> a race of short, stocky expert smiths and miners who live in elaborate subterranean mountain fortresses and have a lifespan measured in centuries. However, they're also a matriarchy, have limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a> powers, were created by overthrown elder gods to dig them out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">prisons the dragons stuck them in</a> (a cause most urZrethi ended up abandoning after a disastrous war with the dragons), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the fem!Sauron-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is actually a half-urZrethi (and half-dragon) who uses her shapeshifting abilities to look sort-of-elven. Turns out that they're not actually restricted to the "short, stocky humanoid" model, they just find it fairly utilitarian</span>.
</li><li> R. A. Salvatore's <em>Demon Wars</em> saga has dwarves who are also called powries. They've got a lot of the typical dwarf traits - short, stocky, tough, and bearded. However, they're also an <em>incredibly</em> aggressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> who mostly interact with humans only when raiding them, live on an archipelago and are famous for their "barrelboats" (low-slung ships that the powries, with their superhuman endurance, <em>paddle</em> fast enough to catch most human ships), and maintain their physical prowess with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note54u4u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note54u4u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note54u4u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Powries always wear red caps, which they dye with the blood of dead enemies; the magic in the caps allows this to strengthen the powrie wearer, and works just as well for any non-powrie who gets a hold of one</span>. They're all around nasty pieces of work, and while not quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> (they demonstrate loyalty to each other and extend respect towards non-powries who they consider sufficiently badass, at least) most humans hate and fear them - a reputation the powries themselves are happy to encourage.
</li><li> Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiderwickChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiderwickChronicles">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a></em> resemble much like most depictions, but draw more from their depictions in European fairy lore. They are entirely subterranean (they can't stand bright light), reproduce by carving others of their kind from stone, and are miners and craftsmen. However, their centuries-long lifespans means they greatly pity the shorter-lived beings and try to improve on nature with mechanical replicas or preserving living beings in glass coffins for immortal slumber. They serve as the antagonists of the 4th book in the original series, under Mulgarath's orders.
</li><li> Humboldt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> is a sensitive, snack-serving Dwarf who is part of a clan cursed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaintenance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaintenance">maintain the traps and monsters</a> within the Crypts of Ramen, and who seems genuinely sad knowing that everyone who comes though the Crypts will almost certainly die. His greatest passion is reading love poetry and he's reduced to a mess of tears when our heroes tell him a modern love story from Earth: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Titanic</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OracleOfTao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OracleOfTao">Oracle of Tao</a></em>: The dwarves are basically played to very Germanic archetypes. Male dwarves meaning a classic size of about three feet, built like a barrel and loaded with muscles (to the point where they apparently can't run). The women wear dirndls, are almost two feet taller and lean yet buxom, with no muscle mass to speak of. They are just as capable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless">of punching a hole in a rock wall however</a>. Dwarves are apparently <em>very</em> shy, only meeting each other at drinking festivals or when tunnels overlap. Also, those not around humans much (Phim seems to ignore this) talk like Scottish miners or something, using words like "lass" and "derned". They have skin so tough as to be runeproof (though indirect effects like earthquakes or hot ground can still harm them, a fireball would just singe their clothes).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoguesOfTheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoguesOfTheRepublic">Rogues of the Republic</a>:</em> A calm, industrious race known for clever machines and a near-utopian society where everyone tries to help everyone else. Also, they don't live underground, though they do mine as much as any other industrial race would have to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard">Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</a></em> keeps the bit about being skilled smiths (with the exception of the main character's friend, Blitz) but throws in some odd tidbits: they evolved from maggots, come from a world of pure darkness and sunlight gradually turns them to stone, and there's a certain population among them with divine blood which is taller and more attractive (by self-proclamation). And most of these differences come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">straight from Norse mythology</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheActsOfCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheActsOfCaine">The Acts of Caine</a></em>: They are called Stonebenders ("Dwarves" is a racial slur used by humans) and do all of their stone- and metalwork with their bare hands.
</li><li> In Jenna Rhodes <em>Elven Ways</em> series, the dwarf-like Dwellers are a stand-in for both Tolkien's dwarves and hobbits. They are the first race of the particular world and while they have some affinity for underground, their earthly link is more towards forests and fields. They have a Dwarf's usual inhuman toughness, but they have the Hobbits love for home, comfort and good food.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrashOfTheCountsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrashOfTheCountsFamily">Trash of the Count's Family</a></em>, there are several tribes of dwarves, and while they aren't described in detail, none seem to fit the standard dwarf model. Most tribes are known for their proficiency in inventing and making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">magic tools</a>. The Dwarves of the Flame Dwarf Tribe are unable to use magic, and therefore can't create magic tools, but their inventions are of much higher quality. Cale recruits a half-dwarf, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerebeastsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerebeastsAreDifferent">half-Mouse Beastman</a> to design and build things for him.

</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Mike Pondsmith's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CastleFalkenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CastleFalkenstein">Castle Falkenstein</a></em> roleplaying game (from R. Talsorian Games) had dwarves based more on the ancient Germanic myth model — supernaturally strong and resistant to fire, with chicken feet (which they hide by wearing big boots), and <em>no females at all.</em> When they marry, they marry Faerie women — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualsBreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualsBreed">the male children are more Dwarves, the girls are Faeries like Mom</a>. They do have the whole mining and beer obsession, but are more likely to fight with big wrenches than axes as they are the master technologists of their world.
<ul><li> Falkenstein's Dwarves started out as more typical Faerie, but gave up most of the classic traits thereof in exchange for the ability to handle iron with impunity.
</li><li> Young Falkenstein dwarves are also raised and named by their mothers. Their main drive toward industrialism and workmanship is so they can make or discover something impressive enough to make a name for themselves with, so they don't have to introduce themselves as "Buttercup" or "Morningblossom".
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has produced a few dwarven subraces that break the mold.
<ul><li> The wild dwarves from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> are barbarians who live above ground in jungles and hunt with poisoned blades. Still very gruff and loyal, though. The same setting also has arctic dwarves, or Innugaakalikurit, who are white-haired, have no affinity for metalwork or living underground, are expert hunters and trackers, are immune to the cold but love to sunbathe until their skin burns, and favor spears and harpoons over axes. They're also short and squat even by <em>dwarfish</em> standards.
</li><li> The derro are a race of insane sorcerers with traces of human ancestry. They have bluish skin, blond hair, and huge, pupil-less eyes, and many go beardless. (In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, though, they are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">evil fey</a> with no connection to dwarves that behave like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a>.) They were inspired by an alien race of the same name in the works of science-fiction author/conspiracy theorist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardSharpeShaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardSharpeShaver">Richard Sharpe Shaver</a>.
</li><li> Several dwarven subraces in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>. Clan Daergar resemble common dwarves in appearance and culture, but are ruthlessly evil — or may be straight-up expies of the Duergar. Clans Theiwar and Klar are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of the derro, but split into two halves; the Theiwar keep the magic and generally evil attitude, the Klar keep the appearance and the rampant insanity (racially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a>, but prone to being manipulated by their fellow Deep Dwarves the Daergar and Thiewar). Clan Zakhar are hairless, diseased outcasts. Finally, Clan Aghar, more commonly known as gully dwarves, are diminutive idiots who serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a>.
</li><li> 3.5 presented several environmental variants with only minor differences from the standard hill dwarf. Desert dwarves are gruff miners who are good at finding water. Glacier dwarves are gruff miners who are good at surviving in the arctic. Seacliff dwarves are gruff miners who are good at swimming. And so on.
</li><li> Duergar, essentially the dwarf equivalent of drow, have shown up in a few settings. They tend to be grim, regimented, joyless workaholics and slave-traders.
</li><li> Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> are completely hairless, have absolutely no knack for metalwork at all (as metal is almost extinct on their world), are completely illiterate, have superhuman stamina, and are workaholics to such an extent that the setting's equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder">Banshee</a> is created from the soul of a dwarf who died before his or her current focus-task was complete.
</li><li> The Kogolors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a> play around with this trope quite heavily. They look like typical dwarves, but they prefer to build houses <em>atop</em> mountains rather than to live in deep underground lairs (though they do enjoy making suitable caves more livable). They aren't particularly more artistically talented than humans, save in the field of brewing liquor, in which they <em>are</em> masters. They also hold no particularly great reverence for builders/miners/sculptors and if anything are more appreciative of hunters and farmers, as they make most of their living as farmers, loggers, trappers, furriers, goat-herds, brewers and woodworkers. Finally, in place of the traditional dwarven grumpiness and stubbornness, Kogolors are friendly, cheerful, gregarious, and welcoming, eager to make friends with anybody who seems nice enough. Further twisting the mold, in Mystara back-lore, Kogolors are the <strong>original model</strong> of dwarves; the more iconic dwarves are an off-shoot species created by a somewhat paranoid Immortal from the heartiest Kogolors, after they began to die out in the wake of the radioactive Blackmoor disaster. The only Kogolors alive today are those preserved in the Hollow World, with the other extinct races and cultures. For icing on the cake, Kogolors have a <em>very</em> heavy-handed Swiss motif, complete with wearing lederhosen and those triangular hats, and having a racial proficiency in <em>yodelling</em>. <br/><br/>If these dwarves remind you a little of gnomes, there's a good reason for that: they're <em>also</em> the progenitor race of gnomes, who were created by a Kogolor turned Immortal, Garal Glitterlode, to preserve his people "more accurately" than Kagyar's dwarves did, and encouraged to spread from their mountainous homes to live elsewhere and just be more adaptable.
</li><li> In addition to the mold-twisting dwarven subraces, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreDifferent">gnomes</a></em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> fall under this as well. Whilst D&amp;D dwarves derive quite heavily from Tolkien's depiction of the dwarves, and are thus dour, heavily armored, non-magical warriors who can produce incredibly fine and even enchanted smithcraft, D&amp;D gnomes are thus humble forest &amp; burrow-dwelling little people with an innate affinity for magic, <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">illusion</a>, and enigmatic connections to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>. This means they draw more heavily upon many <em>mythological</em> depictions of dwarves and dwarf-like fae from throughout Europe, such as Germany, Russia, Sweden and Scotland.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has a somewhat complex relationship with this trope.
<ul><li> Dwarves as-is are as straightforward a take on this trope as one can expect, being a grim, honorable, reclusive and highly traditionally-minded folk who live in beautifully decorated mountain fastnesses, often dedicate themselves to smithing, stonecarving, masonry and similar trades, and have been in fairly steady decline since the fall of their old empire.
</li><li> Generally, dwarves are divided into three broad groups who fit this trope to different degrees:
<ul><li> The Grondaksen, or underground dwarves, are a reclusive folk live their lives in massive cavern cities, are excellent smiths, grow full beards in both sexes and have little contact with surface-dwellers. They still have their own divergent cultures, like the Kulenett of Geb who live nomadically in a country-spanning tunnel system to avoid the notice of the undead who rule the surface.
</li><li> Holtaksen, or mountain dwarves, are dwarves as warriors fond of battle, song, gold and great fortresses amidst the peaks. They're generally the setting's default dwarves.
</li><li> The Ergaksen, or surface dwarves, live scattered across the world and do not form, or think of themselves as, a homogenous group, and can be mildly to wildly divergent from the usual dwarven mold. They include the dour, monastic Pahmet of Osirion, who live on the outskirts of civilization and can control sand; the dark-skinned Mbe'ke and Taralu of the Mwangi jungles, who worship their ancestors, elemental spirits and dragons; the mercantile Paraheen of Qadira, who worship the sun goddess Sarenrae in aspect tied to forge fires; and the monastic, devoutly atheist Vahird of the Eternal Oasis of Rahadoum.
</li></ul></li><li> The dwarven iconic characters — premade characters used to illustrate and exemplify player classes — tend to be wildly divergent from the mold and follow classes rather outside of dwarves' traditional fighter/cleric/paladin archetypes.
<ul><li> Harsk, the iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForestRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForestRanger">ranger</a>, fights with a crossbow, dislikes being indoors, spends most of his time wandering around the woods and dislikes alcohol — it dulls his senses, which in his profession is a very bad thing — and guzzles tea instead.
</li><li> Shardra, the iconic shaman, is a trans woman more interested in history than anything else who has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> since her self-imposed exile from her home.
</li></ul></li><li> The duergar also appear as their grim, unpleasant and slave-driving selves, but are actually the corrupted descendants of the original dwarves, tracing their lineage to those dwarves that didn't burrow up from the heart of the world at the start of the race's history and made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">dark pact</a> with Droskar, the dwarven god of toil and slavery, to survive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>: The Mountain Folk are a race of great craftsmen and engineers who live deep beneath Creation's surface in a rigidly ordered society within a number of underground cities. They worship Autochthon, their creator and the Primordial of machinery and invention, and seek to emulate him through acts of craftmanship and creation. They're also a diminishing people, their past glories and power shaken by many cataclysms and now beset on all sides by enemies. How closely they fit this trope varies between their castes. Workers reach between three and four feet in height and serve as their society's miners, builders and minor technicians, while Warriors grow to five feet and are stoic, steadfast and disciplined warriors. Both tend to be stocky, muscular and heavily built and are often depicted as bearded, and Workers are often shown carrying mining picks. The Craftsmen who rule Mountain Folk society are more slender and as tall as humans, and resemble elves more than anything else. All castes have pointed ears.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>: Dwarves are one of the major metatypes and first appeared in the 2000s with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreBabyBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreBabyBoom">birth of 'spike babies'</a> shortly before the start of the Sixth World. They're essentially a global, tens-of-millions-strong demographic of regular, everyday people with dwarfism and pointy ears, though not without a few quirks:
<ul><li> There are three common stereotypes for dwarves; they're all good with machinery, they hoard gold and they all have major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">Napoleon complexes</a>. The average dwarf has a tendency to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">loud and belligerent</a> when any of these stereotypes is applied to them. This does not change the fact, however, that the dwarf willpower bonus is so useful to certain professions that almost every rigger you'll find is a dwarf. Of course, that just fits the stereotype all the more: Riggers are the nearest thing you will find to a blacksmith or miner in the setting. Gameplay-wise Dwarves also make really good magic-users (mages, shamans or adepts) due to their willpower bonus, and have enough physical bonuses to make decent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSamurai">Street Samurai</a> as well.
</li><li> Dwarves in the setting typically grow beards because they get sick of being treated like children (which a lot of people think they resemble as adults due to their height) without them, which may explain why the stereotype of the "hot headed halfer" came about (as one dwarf tells you in Third Edition in the Dwarf racial description, "<em>you</em> spend a day getting patted and pinched and see how calm you are."). The same essay voices the opinion that dwarves seem to prefer living underground because basement apartments tend to be cheaper, and low ceilings aren't a problem for them.
</li><li> Of the main non-human metatypes, dwarves are the only ones who never established their own separate nations or subcultures. This is in part because they're the metatype that's best managed to integrate with baseline humanity, and in part because they maintain a strong sense of cultural unity regardless of political and corporate ties. Almost all dwarves share a common set of values, typically focused on honoring one's word, stoicism and community. Their skill with technology also helps here, as dwarves are usually comfortable enough with the Matrix that they can easily keep in contract with large numbers of other dwarves across the world.
</li><li> As with all other metahuman strains, a number of divergent metavariants have emerged among dwarf populations. These are gnomes, European dwarves with no facial hair and even shorter statures than normal; hanuman, Indian dwarves with extensive body hair, longer limbs and prehensile tails, who were originally thought to be Awakened monkeys; koborokurus, Japanese dwarves with thick body hair and large noses; menehunes, amphibious Hawaiian dwarves with even thicker hair, nictitating membranes and webbed toes, and claimed by myth to descend from Mu or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>; and querx, blue-skinned German dwarves.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn">Earthdawn</a></em> dwarfs are not only known for mining and axe-swinging, they're known as builders, and not just of physical things, but civilizations as well. As a result they're the dominant race in Barsaive instead of the usual humans, especially after they built the underground "Kaers" where the Namegiver races hid out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">the Scourge</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta">Talislanta</a></em>, the Yassan and Vajra races are both short, stocky artificer/miner typesin other words, indubitably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces">stouts</a>. However, this being <em>Talislanta</em>, the Vajra are scaly, ovoviviparous, and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">berserker rage</a> ability (which can usually be used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">exactly once</a>), and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Yassan</a> are silver-gray, six-fingered, and flat-faced. Additionally, both races are hairless and closer to the short end of average human height.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a> dwarves are short, squat and master mechanics, often being creators or users of guns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> robots, but are typically beardless.
</li><li> Gloranthan (the original setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RuneQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RuneQuest">RuneQuest</a></em>) dwarfs are immortal as long as they do their assigned tasks, regard themselves as servants of the World Machine, and are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">only users of firearms</a> in the world. They also invented iron. Not "discovered", <em>invented</em>. They're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">massive subversions</a> of this trope, in that they are actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotRepublic">Robot Republic</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">Golems</a> made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">Mostal the Maker</a> and taught how to build themselves (hence why female dwarves are so rare-they're actually products of a minor glitch in the process) before he was broken in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">Chaos War</a>. Flesh (Clay) dwarves are actually an invention to make up for lack of resources and time to build more dwarves (and a deeply resented one since they're softer and have less raw intelligence than "pure" Mostali). They're also something of an antagonist to everyone else, being deeply xenophobic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a> (literally the only thing that matters to them is Mostal's repair) with a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> (what everyone else calls greed, the dwarves call keeping track of their projects and resources, down to the last coin - actual trade is regarded as something of an oddball heresy).
</li><li> Dwarves have appeared sporadically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, though the game designers seem not to like them much. They live in the mountains and like to fight so they belong to the Red color/philosophy, but the stoic and orderly culture of traditional fantasy dwarves is more White, not to mention how goblins hog all the slots for person sized red creatures, so they're sort of an odd race out. <em>MtG</em> did shake up the usual dwarf formula in the <em>Odyssey</em> block, where the dwarves were portrayed as passionate artisans and warriors with a strong affinity for fire magic. Later in the game's history, the kithkin in <em>Lorwyn</em> were portrayed as sort of a cross between hobbits (which is what they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">originally intended to be called</a>) and dwarves, combining the Little Folk's general smallness and pastoral living with the Stout Folk's tenacity and well-organized communal defense; the kithkin become even more dwarflike in <em>Shadowmoor</em>, where they have abandoned their country villages for heavily fortified castles and become rabidly xenophobic.
<ul><li> The <em>Eventide</em> expansion to the <em>Shadowmoor</em> block added actual dwarves known as duergar, with affinities for both white and red, and modified the design of dwarves to axe the hair and make them up more pasty. These creepy dwarves are based on the folklore of Britain.
</li><li> They show up again in Kaladesh, a plane where artisans and craftsmen are the norm rather than the exception. In addition to being good at making/repairing things, these dwarves also have an affinity for piloting vehicles. They also make up a decent portion of the security forces/police.
</li><li> They also show up in the fairy-tale inspired plane of Eldraine, where they are fairly typical miners. They are essentially a walking reference to Snow White, though they do rule over the knightly court of Embereth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> once had the Squats, which, naturally, were Dwarfs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE">IN SPACE</a>, but the designers couldn't quite decide on their overall theme. Some models were straight Dwarfs, while others were more like really short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels">Biker Dudes</a> <span class="font-s">IN SPACE</span>, so they got removed from future editions — i.e., they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped A</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Hive Fleet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">On Them</a>. However, the "space Dwarfs" <em>concept</em>, if not the models, seem to be returning in the form of the Demiurg (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Greek for "craftsman"</a>), a mercenary alien race that has worked for both the Imperium and the Tau in the past.
<ul><li> The Tau themselves seem to fulfill some of the functions of dwarves in the 40K Verse. They are shorter and stouter than humans, they have a weak presence in the Warp (meaning they're not very magical), they have a highly ordered and stratified society, and a strong warrior culture... At least when it comes to the Fire caste. And only when compared to other Tau, who are largely peace-loving and lack any aggressiveness. Their technology is also far beyond the Imperium's in many cases, with sleek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> and hover tanks that can run circles around their more traditional Imperial counterparts and standard issue guns that can reach further and hit twice as hard as a bolter. What they do lack compared to "traditional" dwarves is physical strength, as Tau infantry are even weedier than Guardsmen and will die quickly in the face of meaningful assault.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps surprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL">FATAL</a> partially averted this. There are 3 types of dwarves in the game, and while "white dwaves" are pretty standard issue, "black dwarves" are based off the more evil variants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, and "brown dwarves" are based on the more recent faerie tales and particularly modeled off <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_%28folklore%29">brownies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fellowship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fellowship">Fellowship</a></em>, the one thing all types of Dwarf have in common is being tough and determined; they have a unique core stat, Iron, which they can use to outlast opponents while trying to Finish Them or to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge">Clear the Path</a>" for themselves and their allies. The variants available for Dwarfs include Deepdelve (who can see in the dark and can glean extra information using "the secrets that can only be found deep underground"), Firebeard (fierce warriors who can take damage to their Blood stat to get a chance to finish an enemy), Ironblast (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> dwarves who come equipped with powerful but dangerous explosives), and Stoneborn (naturally-tough dwarves who can render themselves immovable as long as they're standing on solid ground).
</li><li> Whilst dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em> are basically standard dwarves with the stereotypes turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark">Grim Dark</a> tweak, their successors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a></em> are more unusual.
<ul><li> It should be noted that they were renamed to a original name of <em>Duardin</em>. Although that was mostly changed so Games Workshop has a copyright-enforceable name, some other races recieved similar treatment.
</li><li> The Fyreslayers are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">religiously motivated</a> mercenaries, who will take up arms for and against anybody to recover the magical substances "ur-gold", which contains the essence of their fallen patron god. Whilst they highly value honor, they also only honor the very letter of the word, which has given them a reputation as, ironically, untrustworthy and fickle. They shun the typical dwarven reliance on heavy armor, instead fighting almost naked, trusting to fate and the protection of enchanted rune "tattoos" made of ur-gold that they literally weld into their bare flesh. They have a limited affinity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire magic</a>, in contrast to the traditionally unmagical nature of Warhammer dwarves, and make use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Magmadroths</a> as steeds and war-beasts.
</li><li> The Kharadron Overlords double-down on the "dwarves as engineers" angle, with an entire civilization built around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">steampunk-flavored</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">magitek</a>. They express the common dwarven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsEvil">aversion to magic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience">preference for science</a>, but are noted as being hypocrites for doing so, as their "science" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPoweredPseudoScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPoweredPseudoScience">actually just sorcery given a technological veneer</a>. Most of the Kharadron are actually highly progressive and innovative, in stark contrast to their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em> counterparts, who were so conservative and traditional-minded that it was called out as one of their greatest weaknesses; this includes abandoning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechnologyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechnologyIsEvil">New Technology is Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">Revenge Before Reason</a> traits that defined the Warhammer dwarves. They're also an overtly meritocratic plutocracy, in contrast to the traditional "Scottish Feudal" array of clan-lords, thanes and high kings. But the biggest difference is that, whilst the Kharadron are still miners, they're a race associated with the <strong>sky</strong> rather than the earth: they live on artificial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingIsland">Floating Islands</a> and their society revolves around hunting for "aether-gold", a magical mineral that normally exists as a <em>gas</em> until artificially condensed into a solid.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> has dwarves that pilot tanks, wield worker tools in battle, and are short and stocky like normal. They also live in a swamp and seem to hate the fairies, enough to capture them to feed their protector Hydra and murder them for living space.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em> games have the Makers, who are similar to your stereotype dwarf in every way except one: instead of being short, they are about four times as tall as your average human. They're also presented as a cosmic level race, being known as "The Makers" because they use their magical crafting abilities to forge <em>planets</em>, and preserve the souls of their dead by imbuing them into massive stone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">golems</a>, which actually mesh with the dwarven archetype pretty well, but still aren't really standard depictions for them.
</li><li> The "Dwarf" character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsCrown">Dragon's Crown</a></em> is a stocky, heavy-set brawler, wielding hammers (and occasionally axes) and possessing strength enough to pick up and toss most foes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Dwarf's ending reveals the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Ancient Dragon</a> had chased the Dwarfs out of their subterranean homes, forcing them to become nomads and driving them to the brink of extinction. The player character's Dwarf becomes a hero and leader among his people, helping them prosper.</span> He does have some traits that make him distinct from dwarves in other games. Where typical dwarves are heavily armoured or wearing workman's clothes, this guy wears little more than a cape and a loincloth. He's also friendly with the Elf of the team if various Vanillaware art pieces are canon.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper</a></em> has two classes of dwarves, the Tunnelers; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">who dig the tunnels</a> for Heroes to reach the Keeper's dungeons, and the Mountain Dwarves who specialize in fighting rather than mining. They're rather weak and frail compared to all other humans and even elves, while also being one of the fastest creatures in the game. They're attracted to gold and will go straight for the Keeper's Treasure Rooms, and they're so skilled at digging they can even do it using axes instead of pickaxes.
<ul><li> The sequel gets rid of Mountain Dwarves entirely, turning Dwarves into the weakest type of Heroes available, but a must to tunnel through the maps.
</li></ul></li><li> Dwarves are commented on as being rather out of place in the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona">Elona</a></em>, populated by the likes of kitsune, samurai, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mecha</a>. They only seem more so when the setting is revealed to be a full scale quasi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">urban fantasy</a> as of the later patches of Elona+, glaringly being rather technologically simplistic compared to most of the human factions (using plate mail and tonfas when everyone else has for the most part moved onto machine guns and fighter jets), in spite of possessing the trademark dwarven craftsmanship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> plays with it when it comes to the extinct Dwemer, also known as the Dwarves. To note:
<ul><li> Playing the trope straight, the Dwemer did build <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis">technologically advanced cities</a>, typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">deep into the ground</a>, complete with gold/bronze architecture and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine">Eternal Engines</a>. They warred with just about every other race they came into contact with, <em>particularly</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVersusDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVersusDwarves">other races of Mer</a>. They were known to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard">glorious beards</a> and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">master craftsmen</a>, with their equipment still being among the best and most sought after in Tamriel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">even thousands of years</a> after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">mysterious disappearance</a>, in some way related to them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep">digging too deep</a> beneath Red Mountain and discovering (and then attempting to tap into) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Heart of Lorkhan</a>, the dead creator god of the mortal plane.
</li><li> On the "aversion" side, the Dwemer are a sub-race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Mer (Elves)</a>, with their name meaning the "Deep Elves" or "Deep Ones," referring to their <em>philosophical</em> depth. They were of average size compared to the other races of Tamriel and the term "dwarf" is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">archeological misnomer</a>. They were the first "normal sized" race to encounter the Giants of the Velothi Mountains, who referred to them as "dwarves" in size comparison to themselves. Later, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a> (and through them, the other races of Men) picked up the term and it stuck. They weren't known to have any stereotypical "Dwarvish" accents, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">only Dwemer spoken to in the series to date</a> having a nasally, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdyNasalness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdyNasalness">nerdy</a></em> voice of all things. While the Dwemer did create all manner of extremely advanced technology, much of it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">magically derived</a> in one form or another, with it being said that they were also master enchanters. They created numerous forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> programmed with some sort of rudimentary (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapShoot">and often dangerous</a>) AI. They were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist">Naytheists</a> in a world where gods of all sorts exist, though the Dwemer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">did not believe these "gods" were truly divine</a>. They'd summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedra</a> just to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">test their divinity</a>. Finally, they followed a <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>. Former series developer Michael Kirkbride puts it best:
<div class="indent"> <em>"That's why the Dwemer are the weirdest race in Tamriel and, frankly, also the scariest. They look(ed) like us, they sometimes act(ed) like us, but when you really put them under the magnifying glass you see nothing but vessels that house an intelligence and value system that is by all accounts Beyond Human Comprehension. (...) There isn't even a word to describe the Dwarven view on divinity. They were atheists on a world where gods exist."</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend">Endless Legend</a></em>'s Delvers are relatively standard-issue dwarves in appearance, but they are actually the descendants of human miners that were trapped underground in a cataclysm that swept across Auriga. They swing warhammers in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack">Spin Attack</a> and have vast beards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls">adorned with skulls</a> (probably from their fellow Delvers that died). The Vaulters are human, but their heavy armor, beards, and overall high level of technology make them <em>look</em> like dwarves. The Vaulters remember their origins in space, and utilize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> salvaged from their vaults and augmented or repaired with magic. Prior to the start of the game, they lived almost completely underground.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> mostly follows the standard, although the dwarves come off a bit more Scandanavian than Scottish. This trope is partly averted by the Stone Summit clan, a bunch of xenophobic slavedriving hatemongers, then it gets taken to its conclusion at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the end of the Eye of the North expansion pack. The dwarves seek to awaken the Great Dwarf to battle the destroyers pouring out from beneath the earth. What happens is that <em>they</em> become the Great Dwarf, their bodies turning to solid stone and their hearts consumed with an eternal thirst for battle, so they can fight the destroyers for eternity</span>.
</li><li> They have appeared sporadically in the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> installments of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series. Their main distinctions from other fantasy dwarves are their catchphrase of "Laliho!" and the fact that they are almost completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">faceless</a> with only glowing yellow eyes (and a beard) visible beneath their helmets.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>'s dwarves live in Mt. Duergar, which is the old Norse word for Dwarf, and are skilled miners; their tunnels are filled with rails for spoil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> plays it straight, and heck, so do <em>most</em> dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears">Final Fantasy IV: The After Years</a></em>. However, Luca is clean-shaven and doesn't have much love for dwarven fashion. The one thing she gets right is a love of technology, with two custom-built clockwork dolls at her command, but she'd rather study under the human Cid than other dwarves.
</li><li> Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> strongly resemble their counterparts in IV, and like them live in an "underworld" (this time an undersea trench rather than just above the earth's mantle) and love to tunnel, although their great kingdom is less populated than most villages and not relevant to the plot.
</li><li> The Dwarves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> are perhaps the least dwarf-like Dwarves in the series. They spend their time above ground, albeit on a mountain, and the sun is a big part of their society and religion.
</li><li> Moogles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> are also fairly dwarf-like: short, mechanically inclined humanoids.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>'s dwarves play around a bit. A beast-tribe from the alternate world of The First, on the outside they appear to be the classic Final Fantasy dwarf, never seen without their face obscuring helmets and beards. But the beards turn out to be elaborate scarves, and taking off the "beard" and helmet reveal them to be the First's versions of Lalafells, the Cute race of the main setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces">Five Races</a>. Cue Lalafell/Laliho jokes.
</li><li> The Lilties of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles">Crystal Chronicles</a> also fit the archetype fairly well, but in appearance resemble childlike humanoids with plant features (besides Crystal Bearers, in which a wide variety of Lilty types appear). A big difference is, before they began weapon smithing, they were primarily alchemists. And while they've always been mediocre at using them, they were experts at creating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Green Rocks</a> required for spells.
</li></ul></li><li> Partially subverted in the <em>Lineage</em> MMORPGs: The male dwarves are about what you expect, but the female dwarves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">resemble cute elves, only half the size</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a></em>, while Apotikara is a society run by blacksmiths sporting an army of dwarves with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">An Axe to Grind</a>, the dwarves of Mount Arsia are a rebellious faction of coal miners, and the dwarves in Cerberus Hills are a fairly peaceful agrarian society. Plus, dwarves have a sophisticated grasp of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">earth magic</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> goes back to the roots of Norse myths, making Dwarves simply good craftsmen and gold-diggers. They don't use axes, except for gathering wood or when transformed into Heroes of Ragnarok by the Ragnarok godpower.
<ul><li> Eitri uses an axe to fight in the campaign, though he can use it to cut wood. His brother Brokk has a hammer instead.
</li><li> Mountain Giants have a special attack against them... which is to kick them a certain distance, often making the dwarves into a projectile weapon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> is an interesting case. When dwarves were introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII">Warcraft II</a></em>, they were primarily represented through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">aerial gryphon riders</a>. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> hit, however, the playable dwarves were mountain-dwelling, ale-drinking, blacksmiths and miners, with the gryphon riders relegated to a minor NPC faction.
</li><li> However, this was explained by there being three major kinds of dwarves:
<ul><li> The main playable race are called Ironforge dwarves, they live in the city of Ironforge and were originally the most stereotypical of the dwarfs. Subverted when the revelation of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTitansAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTitansAreDifferent">titan</a> origins led to a surge in interest in science and knowledge in dwarven society. Their king Magni Bronzebeard even ordered that the main dwarven industry be switched from mining to archeology. Now you'll find just as many explorers, scientists, archaeologists and scholars among the dwarves as you will miners and blacksmiths. Another unique aspect of Ironforge dwarves is the ability to temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor">turn into stone</a> which lets them remove status ailments and increase their defense for 8 seconds.
</li><li> The next is the Wildhammer dwarves who live above ground, live at peace with nature, and ride gryphons as a major part of their culture. They were the representatives when dwarves were first added to the franchise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII">Warcraft II</a></em>.
</li><li> The third are the Dark Iron Dwarves, who have grey skin and red eyes and were until recently enslaved by a massive fire elemental (that they summoned in a failed attempt to destroy the other two clans). They're pyromaniacs with strong magical abilities and were written as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> until their leader joined the Alliance in <em>Cataclysm</em>, live deeper underground than their Ironforge cousins, are much more educated in magic, and stealth. After they joined the Alliance, playable Ironforge Dwarves gained the option to become Mages and Warlocks suggesting an intermixing of culture between the two. The fact that the king of the Ironforge's daughter married the Dark Iron emperor, and her son, and future king, is half Ironforge-and-half Dark Iron, has caused much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather">consternation</a> among the dwarves. As of <em>Battle For Azeroth</em>, Dark Iron Dwarves have become a playable race for the Alliance.
</li><li> Beyond this you have various proto-dwarves. There are the Earthen, which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockMonster">stone-flesh</a> creations of the titans that the dwarves evolved from. The frost dwarves, who are the frozen counterparts to the Wildhammers. They are descended more directly from the Earthen as indicated by their proximity to the Titan Architecture found around their homeland. And the iron dwarves, which artificial dwarves that serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Female Dwarves are actually quite common in dwarf settlements and for the most part look like short, stout women of average attractiveness. However, among the player base they are quite rare (perhaps in part due to the fact they are just plain looking compared to other races). Lore mentions bearded women that are considered quite beautiful among dwarves, however, none are shown in game.
</li><li> Additionally, the technology aspect of the dwarves exists but is typically overshadowed by the gnomes. The technology basically breaks down into two categories: anything that can be made reliable, cost-effective, and useful on the battlefield will be adopted by the dwarves, i.e. tanks, guns, gyrocopters. The gnomes manage the overly-expensive, unreliable and quirky technology, as per their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> hat. If it's cheap, unreliable, and <em>dangerous</em>, that's Goblin territory.
</li><li> Prior to Cataclysm, Ironforge dwarves mostly fit into the typical melee archetype, with their only available classes being physical damage dealers and tanks, with the exception of Priests and Paladins. But after the expansion, dwarves gained the ability to be Mages, Warlocks, and Shaman (explained in lore by the Wildhammer and Dark Iron clans joining Ironforge, with the Wildhammer teaching Shamanism and the Dark Iron bringing arcane and dark magic), making them the most versatile Alliance race (they can be class but Druids), and make perfectly viable casters in addition to brawny melee and hunters, though their passive racial bonuses still favor melee more than magic.
</li><li> They can also be any job, so dwarven leatherworkers, herbalists, and fishermen aren't unheard of. They are not limited to mining and blacksmithing like the stereotypical fantasy dwarf.
</li><li> Another major difference from your archetypal dwarf is Azeroth's dwarves have historically had pretty good relations with elves. The Wildhammer Clan were close allies with the High Elves, and the remaining High Elves in the Alliance are still reasonably good allies with the Ironforge Dwarves over a shared love of history and scholarship. The War of the Ancients novels implied that dwarven ancestors helped the Night Elves prior to the Sundering. Whatever enmity dwarves may have with Blood Elves has more to do with them being Horde, rather than being elves.
</li><li> Furthermore, as time has gone on, the traditional dwarven mining and smithing trades have fallen to the wayside some (at least as much as is possible, considering half of their capital city is literally a giant forge) in favour of archaeology. With smiths outside of Ironforge as likely to come from any common race as from dwarves, the prevalence of dwarven archaeologists - particularly Brann Bronzebeard, and the dwarven-led Explorers' League - (not to mention a racial bonus to the in-game Archaeology profession) has given Azeroth's dwarves an interestingly subtle distinctiveness among the ranks of dwarvenkind across fiction.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalStarsign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalStarsign">Magical Starsign</a></em>, dwarves are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">tiny balls of fluff</a> who consist mainly of a beard with hands, feet, and beady little eyes. Not much is made of their physical prowess, but they're the best starship engineers in the galaxy.
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> doesn't stray from the path too far. Yes, their dwarves are <a class="urllink" href="http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/7-Foot_Dwarf_%28Royale%29">7-Feet Tall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but other than that they act exactly the same as here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dwarves speak with North American accents (except Bodahn, who may be trying to affect the accent of humans), and while beards among men are fashionable, many others go with mustaches or even clean-shaven, and the women can be very feminine and beautiful. Also, their society practices a rigid caste system and the capital city Orzammar is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>. Beyond these things though, they heavily overlap with other traits commonly associated with dwarves: great underground halls; skill at mining and smithcraft; axes, hammers, and crossbows as their preferred (though not only) weapons, and heavy plate as their favored armor; squarish, angular motifs in their equipment and architecture; a fondness for ale; and so on and so forth. While they love ale, Dwarven beer is brewed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATankardOfMooseUrine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATankardOfMooseUrine">lichen, mushrooms, dead rats and other stuff that can be found underground</a>, and tastes exactly the way you would expect fermented lichen-and-rat to taste. So the typical Dwarven quality of being master brewers is subverted. Oghren cites the quality of beer on the surface as a contributing reason to the large emigration of Dwarves from Orzammar.
</li><li> Varric from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> seems to be a deliberate aversion of this trope; he's a clean-shaven, sophisticated, charismatic urbanite who loves the surface, hates the underground, and is a crossbow-wielding rogue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">His brother Bartrand</a>, on the other hand, is as traditional as can be, having been born and raised in Orzammar before their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleFugitive">noble family</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile">exiled</a> for fixing Proving matches.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Varric</strong>: You know what Orzammar is? It's cramped tunnels filled with nug-shit and body odour, and every person there thinks he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">better than you</a> because his great-great-great-grandfather made a water clock or something.
</div></li><li> Surface Dwarves seem to intentionally avert this. After the entire Merchant caste left Orzammar for the surface to get better trading deals, Orzammar declared them "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">Lost to the Stone</a>" and decreed that <em>all</em> Surfacers were to be considered Casteless from that point onwards. The Surfacers responded by simply abandoning the caste system altogether and many other Dwarven traditions, with many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">going completely native</a>. Varric is a prime example of the cross-cultural mixing, invoking both the traditional Paragons and Ancestors venerated by Dwarven religion, as well as the Maker and Andraste worshipped by the Human Chantry.
</li><li> Among the playable races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">later</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid">Qun</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">ari</a>), the Dwarves are unique in one way: they cannot be mages. For whatever reason (believed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their severed connection to the Titans, though this is unconfirmed</span>), they lack a connection to the Fade, and thus cannot draw on it to use in spells like the other races can. They also are incapable of dreaming, as in this setting one visits the Fade when they dream. The only Dwarves who are anywhere near averting this restriction are Dagna, a scholar who learned how to enchant things through sheer optimistic determination, and a Dwarven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Inquisitor</a>, who was given the ability to open and close Rifts between Thedas and the Fade by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ancient Elven technology</span> and being either insanely (un)lucky or being guided by the hand of the Maker (in whom most Dwarves don't believe, because of the aforementioned Fade insensitivity). In the DLC expansion <em>The Descent</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryPartyMember">Temporary Party Member</a> Valta seems to become the first Dwarven mage through a rather convoluted series of events. Oddly enough, Dwarf-descended Darkspawn that can use magic are fairly common.
</li><li> Another manner that <em>Dragon Age</em> Dwarves stand out is the Carta, a Dwarven crime syndicate modelled after Latin American cartels. They freely move between the surface and underground and are best known for selling lyrium on the black market, though they engage in all manner of criminal activity. In <em>Origins</em> and <em>Inquisition</em>, a Casteless Dwarf player character is a former member.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Cassandra:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">I never would have guessed</a> organized crime would be a Dwarven pastime, but there you have it.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RuneFactory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RuneFactory3">Rune Factory 3</a></em> introduces two dwarves. One is a craftsman and blacksmith — downright obsessive and extremely talented — but is incredibly friendly and laid-back, to the point that he considers his job as a blacksmith to simply be a hobby. The other is your typical belligerent warrior dwarf. Both are human-sized and beardless, with pointed ears — the warrior complains that the whole "short, bearded man" thing is simply a racist stereotype.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4">Rune Factory 4</a></em> Takes this a little further. While Gaius and Zaid from the previous game were at least among the shorter characters, Bado, the laid back and downright lazy dwarf blacksmith in the next installment is quite possibly the tallest humanoid character in the series. Doug, the other dwarf in <em>Rune Factory </em>4, is also rotten at crafting. (Dwarfs being good at making weapons is the one trait associated with dwarfs that the series makes a point of telling you still holds true.)
</li><li> Despite this, there is one character who fits the common dwarf mold perfectly, having a short stature, long messy beard, talking in a gruff accent, etc. Leo, from the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em> game claims he picked up these traits while training under a dwarf, but he himself is human. The most dwarf-like character in Rune Factory is a human.
</li></ul></li><li> Even though he's 100% human, Torbjorn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> follows every dwarven trope to a T, although with a Swedish accent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift">Rift</a></em>'s dwarves seem to be rather more inclined towards magic use than the usual, and don't always have beards. Also, the women are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutesyDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutesyDwarf">ridiculously cute</a>.
</li><li> The dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diggles">Diggles: The Myth of Fenris</a></em> are a bit skinny and less grumpy, but borrow heavily from the dwarf stereotype.
</li><li> Deep Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></em> are a variant. Unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">now-background</a> Mountain Dwarves (who are typical), they never left their underground homes. They are highly resistant to damage, but lack the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> all other species have, relying on a Heal Wounds ability. They're decent with the typical dwarvern weapons, axes and crossbows, but prefer stealth, divine magic, and certain kinds of arcane magic: necromancy, translocations and especially earth magic.
</li><li> The Dwarves of the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> verse customized their dwarves by removing one of the traditional details: rather than hating elves, they were <em>allies</em> (up until Heroes IV). Well, except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VIII, but the Dark Dwarves of that game customized the model by being xenophobes to the point that no one is really sure if they are allies or servants of the Earth Elementals instead.
</li><li> Gilius Thunderhead from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenAxe">Golden Axe</a></em>. He's apparently competitive enough to test his mettle at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">tennis and kart racing</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> actually creates a fairly complex dwarven society. They have elected officials and a rudimentary police force and bureaucracy, as well as a larger-than-usual range of professions; you have dwarven tailors, cooks, millers and even beekeepers as well as the usual blacksmiths and miners. But at the end of they day, they're also manic-depressives that require alcohol to get through the day, even from birth. And the creator has even said explicitly that he's keeping Dwarves relatively close to the norm — while he's been designing complicated algorithms to generate deep and varied cultures for other races, he intends to leave dwarves more or less identical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">so they'll be easy for players to step into as a playable race.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallFromHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallFromHeaven">Fall from Heaven</a></em>, the Khazad are pretty standard; short and stout master miners and engineers who live underground, use axes (but most everyone uses axes in this setting), are terrible at using magic, have the finest cannons and trebuchets in the setting, and gain benefits from a full gold vault. However, the Luchuirp dwarves are very different, resembling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreWeirder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreWeirder">gnomes</a> in a lot of respects. They live above ground (though they're still connected to Earth magic) and are one of the most magically-adept factions. In fact, they are second to none as magical artificers and enchanters, which allows them to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">golems</a> for labor and warfare. Neither group has a particular problem with Elves, though Elves in this setting are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> and <em>really</em> do not like other races in general.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls2">Dark Souls 2</a></em> introduces the Gyrm. They have many dwarvish traits: very strong, stockily built, bearded, enjoy drinking heavily from tankards, live underground, wield hammers and axes... however, while they're stocky, they are also just as tall as a human, so they are in general much <em>larger</em> than an average human. They aren't very good at engineering, as the game describes most of their handiwork as "crude" (albeit <em>very</em> tough). Further, they don't live underground by choice (they were driven there by humans motivated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>), nor are they particularly interested in mining. Given the aforementioned getting driven underground, they <em>despise</em> humanity. Only one Gyrm in the game will even speak to you (and he's not that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle">linguistically proficient</a>), while the rest will attack on sight.
</li><li> From Whale Rock Games's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WeAreTheDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WeAreTheDwarves">We Are The Dwarves</a></em>, gun-toting Forcer and axe-wielding Smashfist are your standard dwarves - albeit they're dwarven astronauts on an alien world. It's the third dwarf, Shadow that breaks with convention. Shadow is a dark-skinned ninja dwarf with a longbow, who relies on stealth and sniping foes with his longbow in contrast to the direct force used by his comrades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Smite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Smite">Smite</a></em> actually touches some particular traits about how dwarves were in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> with Fafnir. He's a dwarf that excels in mining and creating jewelries and armed with a hammer. And just like the rest of his kin, he's a selfish, easily-jealous, greedy jerk, as opposed to the normally 'honor-bound' dwarves in other medias. Just for this game, he also lacks the usual Scottish accent and love for wine (it is replaced with his love for gold).
</li><li> One dwarf appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> in a secret area of the mine. He seems to be modeled after the <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> dwarves in that you never see his face directly although he appears to lack the beard. In true dwarf fashion, he sells items related to mining, and can be befriended by giving him gemstones but you have to learn dwarvish before you can do so. Interestingly, the dwarves are apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a> from another planet, The horns on the dwarven helmets you can find may actually be protrusions for antennae. I kid you not, <em>our dwarves are aliens from space</em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> series, the Goron race derives heavily from the stock Tolkienian dwarf. They're physically strong, have a strong mining culture, and (in later games) have great battle prowess. However, they're physically larger than the mundane Hylians, and they don't mine because they're obsessed with gold and precious stones, but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatDirtCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatDirtCheap">they eat rocks</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathfinderKingmaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathfinderKingmaker">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a></em>: Harrim is an interesting example. From the get-go he seems to diverge from the dwarven stereotype: While a heavily armoured warrior-priest who's decent at combat, he's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">perpetually downcast</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> who worships Groetus, a deity that personifies the inevitable decay of everything. The more you talk to Harrim it's also made clear that he'd like nothing better than to <em>be</em> a stereotypical dwarf, but his complete inability to craft anything from metal or stone (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is implied to be a divine gift/curse</span>) is a cause of great bitterness and shame to him and turned him into his current self. As a result, his pride in being a dwarf is conflicted at best and he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> concerning the dwarf chief god Torag, which he refers to as the "traitor god".
</li><li> The Dvar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWondersPlanetfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWondersPlanetfall">Age of Wonders: Planetfall</a></em> are descendants of human miners and engineers left behind on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">an uninhabitable mining world</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CataclysmBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CataclysmBackstory">when the Star Union fell</a>.

Stereotyped as stubborn, materialistic and conservative, the Dvar fulfill most dwarven stereotypes except that their names and accents are Russian, not Scottish, and a lot of their buildings, units and technology have a definite 'Soviet industrial' aesthetic to it. They don't have beards (that we can see) but several of their encounter suits have oxygen piping shaped like stereotypical dwarven beards.

</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/UnforgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/UnforgottenRealms">Unforgotten Realms</a></em> averts this about as far as is possible. <em>Any</em> character which isn't obviously another species is invariably a Dwarf.

</li><li> Most of the Dwarves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LookingForGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LookingForGroup">Looking for Group</a></em> are evil, black leather-wearing, pierced punks.

Digger the wombat does not approve, as that magic tends to wear off after a while if not carefully maintained, leaving abandoned dwarf cities as veritable deathtraps. Come to think of it, the wombats seem to fit the traditional dwarf mold pretty well, themselves.

The stereotypical dwarf is a keen businessman with a great talent for making money, and many human businesses employ a dwarf, or several, to handle their finances.

However he doesn't have racism against elves (the game master said the rivalry doesn't exist in his world), is closer to nature and doesn't have a drinking habit. A live adventure showed that his brethren are more cyborgs than dwarf and even for them Grunlek is different.

Often clean-shaven, they have pointy ears and are rather weak but quite agile because of their skinny physique. The butt monkeys of the comic, Sláine gives his dwarven sidekick Ukko daily beatings to keep him at least somewhat honest and it's implied that this is a common fate for dwarves. The only thing shared between <em>Sláine</em>'s dwarves and Tolkien's is the lack of height.

He is a dwarf who loves his gold, and has taken to guarding it twenty-four seven... in the form of a giant, magic-proof Pike. Unfortunately for Andravi, he's not bazooka-proof. As he's dying, he's seen to be a regular dwarf in his normal form, complete with beard.
</li><li> In Sylvain Runberg's <em>Konungar</em>, the Dvergar are dwarves that are red-skinned, very agile and have pointed ears. They live in the forest and pose a great threat to travelers as they eat horses and other livestock, as well as attack humans for their eyes. The Dvergar are an accursed race that Odin and the other gods did not bless with eyes, so they try to gouge them out of humans in the hopes that they can put them in their empty eye-sockets.

They are all clean-shaven and only wear a beard when working in the mine. They are also relatively average in size, with the exception of Bubi, who is relatively small, and Ralfie, who is two heads taller and two times wider than anyone else in the films (and also is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder29');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder29" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> (where it is spelled "Dwarfs", just like Tolkien noted in the preface to later editions of <em>The Hobbit</em>). Policeman Vimes' experience with them points to countryside dwarfs usually being quiet industrious types who don't cause trouble, and putting on airs of being rowdy and violent seems to be a trait only annoyingly common in his city. This is probably because, unlike their home mines, the city won't cave in on their heads if they're noisy, and there's more beer available. Also they are German and Welsh as well as Scottish. Interestingly, given the Semitic roots of Tolkien's dwarvish language, there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">are theories</a> that Pratchett's dwarfs are Jewish-ish (quiet, hard-working, thrifty, very respectful of ancient traditions that they don't feel they necessarily follow as closely as they're supposed to.
<ul><li> The above description also fits many other ethnic and/or immigrant groups besides Jewish-ish.
<ul><li> The "Dwarfs as Jews" groupthink probably came from that one Watch book that had multiple jokes about Dwarfs being in love with gold. "What? No, we only say that to get it into bed."
</li><li> One should note, however, that somewhat similarly to Judaism, where it is forbidden to destroy a text that mentions the name of God, for the dwarves, it is forbidden to destroy any text at all.
</li><li> The love of gold, of course, is very probably from the miner/craftsman aspect (especially since it is often compared to their love of iron) making things seem very recursive. The Dwarfs seem to have the tendency of being put in the place of any immigrant ethnic group whether black (in <em>Soul Music</em> they come up with "Rap" or "Rat" music) or Muslim (<em>Thud</em>) or yes, Jewish. Trolls on the other hand, seem to be just sentient rocks.
</li><li> Trolls and Dwarfs do share a tradition of "Hole Music".
</li></ul></li><li> Dwarf women are also often seen — however, they are physically indistinguishable from male Dwarfs. This has had an effect on their culture somewhat, in that many Dwarfs do not use female pronouns, courtship is largely devoted to very carefully finding out what sex, under all that leather and chainmail, the other Dwarf is, and a Dwarf identifying herself as female is treated akin to coming out as gay in a conservative society. Exemplified by Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom of the Ankh-Morpork Watch, who "comes out" as a female, wearing boiled leather skirts, high-heeled boots, and makeup, much to the chagrin of other dwarfs, but is never without her iron helmet, battleaxe, and <em>beard</em>. Upon suggestion of shaving, she's outright horrified of the mere idea of losing her beard. She may be willing to come out as female, but she's still a <em>dwarf.</em>
</li><li> Being a dwarf also seems to be more a matter of culture than a biological thing, as Captain Carrot is considered a dwarf (by adoption) despite also being a nearly seven-foot-tall human.
<ul><li> Carrot's making a nature/nurture point — culturally he's a dwarf. He was raised as a dwarf, by dwarven parents and went through all the normal processes of growing up as a dwarf. He may not be as hardline dwarfish as the Deep Uberwald dwarves — mainly due to coming from a surface dwarf community near Lancre — but is still more dwarfish than many an Ankh-Morpork city dwarf. He questions the relevance of being (genetically) human in the light of all this.
</li><li> It's pointed out several times that according to dwarf law and custom, Carrot actually is a dwarf. This tends to disturb other dwarfs meeting him for the first time, because they know something's not right but can't quite put their finger on specifically what it is, since their definition of "dwarf" doesn't actually say anything about height. In the dwarf creation myth, the original dwarf and original human were created identical, and only physically diverged thanks to adopting different lifestyles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Unseen Academicals</em> gives us two dwarfs who between them sum up the whole thing. Pepe is a human that converted as an adult, although unlike Carrot he's short enough that this is not obvious, and explicitly a gay man. He is in a long-term romantic and sexual relationship with Madame Sharn, a dwarf that identifies as female but explains it to the protagonist in a way that leaves her biological sex ambiguous and may just be an elaborate "queen" pun. This brings up all sorts of questions as to whether Discworld dwarfs consider gender identity and anatomical equipment at all linked, and for that matter whether a culture that traditionally only has one gender has a concept of sexual orientation at all.
</li><li> All of this plays into the above: in addition to ethnic, cultural and religious minorities, the dwarfs often serve to represent sexual minorities, be it gays or just particularly feminist women.
</li><li> On a more parodic note, the image for dwarfs in the "Art of Discworld" book is essentially the page image, but with a loaf of bread in place of the axe (dwarf pastries are renowned for being more useful as primary weapons than emergency rations).
</li><li> The later books subvert this with the grags, an extremist faction that becomes the Discworld version of Islamic terrorists (bearded, live in caves, have very specific views on women and what they're allowed to do and use violence against those they deem deviants...). Thankfully, these don't last long.
</li></ul></li><li> And about as averted as you can get in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> where Dwarves are human/mole/earthworm hybrids with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrehensileHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrehensileHair">prehensile beards</a> that burrow through the dirt by eating it and then crapping it out as fast as they do. Also, they can suck in water through their skin (a dehydrated dwarf can use this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl">Wall Crawl</a>!), and their saliva is a fast-hardening, glow-in-the-dark anaesthetic.
<ul><li> Also, far from being traditional, they tend to have a healthy disregard for the law. They also tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">eat anything</a> regardless of whether it is alive or sentient. Plus, rather than fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves">elves,</a> they have a long standing rivalry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">goblins,</a> who are able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">shoot fire,</a> which dwarves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">are incredibly vulnerable to and afraid of.</a> The main dwarf character, Mulch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> how ridiculous it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">to form a cultural conflict with the only beings on Earth capable of conjuring your major weakness.</a>
</li><li> In many ways, it's more of an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> than a direct aversion. They live underground and collect gold and jewels because they're evolved to live underground, and hoarding valuables is only natural when you find yourself in a society that values those shiny rocks you come across on a regular basis. They hate elves because a lot of them are criminals, and most of the police are elves. They have long beards because their beard hairs are ultra-sensitive whiskers for probing around in dark tunnels, and can be used to pick locks.
</li></ul></li><li> Niven and Barnes were probably playing homage to this trope with Mary-Martha "Mary-Em" Corbett, an eccentric live-action Gamer from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreamPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreamPark">Dream Park</a> novels. Though human, she's 4'1" tall, is built like a muscular fire hydrant, wields a halberd (~battleaxe), is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> of her adventuring party, guzzles beer like a pro, calls a spade a spade, and sings repetitively while she's marching. Although her songs tend to be a hell of a lot raunchier than this trope usually allows.
</li><li> <em>The Soddit</em>, being a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, starts by taking the traditional portrayal of dwarves up to eleven and then some, although with ludicrously exaggerated Welsh accents, rather than Scottish ones (well, what would you expect a race of miners to sound like, look, you bach?). It's revealed early on, however, that dwarves <em>hate</em> having beards, it's just that they're allergic to shaving soap. Later, when Bingo Grabbins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">questions</a> how they could have possibly carved the great caverns of the Mines of Black Maria with hand-axes (or, as the dwarves themselves claim, trowels), they're forced to admit that they didn't. All the mountains in Upper-Middle Earth are naturally hollow. And at the end of the book it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dwarves are the larval form of dragons.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> novels written by Steven Brust, Easterners, who are identical to real-world humans, are sometimes called "dwarfs" by the tall, elf-like Dragaerans. Easterner society is based on medieval Eastern Europe rather than anything resembling Celtic or Nordic. The Serioli come a bit closer, living underground and forging powerful magical weapons, but are otherwise completely different.

Lucia is slender, skilled with magic, avoids fighting, and holds little interest in gold or industry. Thus, he's closer to an elf than a traditional dwarf. Whether all dwarves are like this is unknown because he's the only one in the setting.
</li><li> In Lyn Abbey's <em>Jerlayne</em>, dwarves are a servitor race to their elven parents. A dwarf is born when an elf mates with an elf (an elf mating with an elf will result in a random variety of fantasy beings such as rusalkas). They have bronze-coloured skin and are all homosexual. Finally unlike the standard dwarf, these dwarves do the farming and household grunt work - they don't mine. In fact, they can't use metal items that haven't been processed by a female elf (only female elves can manipulate and detoxify metal items, and they get their metal by having male elves come to our world to scavenge our junk and bag it).
</li><li> Alviss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em> is king of the dwarves because he's the tallest at 5'9".

And Glanfathan dwarves make their homes in mountains rather than forests but otherwise display the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey">Iroquois-meets-Celtic</a> culture as other Glanfathan.

He also has an American accent, but very briefly fakes a Scottish accent when disguising himself in the Murder on the Rockport Limited arc.
<ul><li> Speaking more broadly, one unusual trait of dwarves in <em>The Adventure Zone</em> is that they all have absurdly large families: Merle being Gundren Rockseeker's cousin means basically nothing because there's so many of them (although it does help him open Wave Echo Cave), and when the Voidfish attempts to remove <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Boyland</span> from the memories of his family after his funeral, the fish nearly dies from the effort of wiping so many minds at once.
