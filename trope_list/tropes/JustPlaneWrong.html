<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Aircraft, air combat, aviation technology, pilot procedures and airport operations in general are often depicted incorrectly in media. As with many technical fields and sciences, this is usually only noticed by those that work in aviation in some capacity, or have an expressed interest and knowledge about itbut don't worry, most of them will tell you in long tirades exactly where that show got it wrong.
</p><p>Several factors conspire to vex aviation fans:
</p><ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a></strong>: In entertainment, as expected, realism takes a backseat to visuals and coolness.
</li><li> <strong>Cost and Availability of Aircraft:</strong> Sure, scoring a four-seater Cherokee or Cessna might be as easy as walking down to the nearest airfield and saying "Who wants to be in a movie?", but larger or older aircraft, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> era, are expensive, rare, and require special care and insurance. Before the advent of CG, most movie makers resorted to modifying or painting more commonly-available training aircraft to play the part of warbirds in movies (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsUnderstudies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsUnderstudies">Weapons Understudies</a>). Availability can also be affected by the period during which the work was filmedit's not like the Air Force was just gonna give you the keys to their high-altitude spy planes during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> (The Soviets certainly weren't going to let you touch theirs). As such, many films rely heavily on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>:</strong> As previously stated, most people won't be able to tell the difference between different aircraft types, or don't care. The only commercial aircraft that anyone in the audience can reasonably be expected to recognize are the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, which (especially in older films and shows) tend to go to glamorous faraway places; other commercial aircraft are relatively interchangeable, and more likely to be headed somewhere pedestrian. Most of the time, the number of engines, wing configuration, or manufacturer won't even have to match what the actors are calling itwhat airplane was in the background shot is not something most viewers are going to question (or are going to care to question).
</li><li> Most of the times, they just don't care. This is more evident in illustrated or animated media.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Finally, the most common offense committed towards aviation, like everything else, comes from <strong>not doing the research</strong>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourNewsNetworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourNewsNetworks">Cable News</a>, with their need to report on any incident or accident as quickly as possible for the first scoop, will invariably use information gleaned from the most misinformed and unreliable sources and witnesses. This "information" is of course then exaggerated and spun to grab the audience, resulting in reports of 600 dead from a 25-passenger commuter aircraft, or cameras following a plane with a damaged landing gear, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">in the hopes of catching a fireball barreling down the runway</a>. Other examples come from doing half the research, and just shooting off aviation terms to sound technical.
</li></ul><p>This trope is most certainly not limited to aviationfor the naval equivalent, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseShips">Artistic License  Ships</a>, for railroading examples see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTrainWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTrainWrong">Just Train Wrong</a>, and for military vehicles see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks">Tanks, but No Tanks</a> and for regular cars see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseCars">Artistic License  Cars</a>.

</p><p></p><hr/><h2>Examples:</h2>
<div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">    open/close all folders  </div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    General </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Both the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver</a></em> examples are understandable in that few US planes would have been easily obtainable with two tails (namely, the F-15 and F/A-18: both examples above have the good guy aircraft being an F-14, so that one's out), and an entertainment studio getting their hands on an actual MiG, or for that matter any Soviet fighter aircraft of any designation, during the Cold War era would have been completely impossible.
<ul><li> Another example of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>-era film <em>The Hunters</em>, which uses repainted F-84F Thunderstreaks as "MiG-15s" for the good guys' F-86 Sabres to fight. Of course, F-84s (earlier models of them, anyway) fought real MiG-15s during the war.
</li><li> This also includes Russian helicopters. In a number of action movies filmed during the 80s, standard NATO-issue or civilian helicopters were modeled to look like Soviet helicopters, typically to look like Mi-24 "Hind" helicopters by adding wings with hardpoints and various bits and bobs. On occasion, the lazy crew didn't even go that far, just slapping a red star decal on an unmodified Western-made helicopter with an obviously Western or civilian paint job.
</li></ul></li><li> Just at the edge of this trope's umbrella: all manner of 1950s Science Fiction serials featured craft of various descriptions, played by footage of a WWII V-2 missile, of which quite a bit of stock footage abounds.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> movies found the need to use substitutes for aircraft such as Messerschmitt 109s and Mitsubishi Zeroes, due to the simple fact that most of them got destroyed in the war. That the <em>Ejército del Aire</em> was equipped with German and Italian aircraft during the Spanish Civil War and continued to operate them after the war was a boon for film-makers.
<ul><li> The role of the Messerschmitt Bf-109 was played in several movies by the Messerschmitt Bf-108 Taifun which was designed as a recreational aircraft but became a military trainer. They were easier to find (and were still produced in France after the war) and looked similar since some aspects of the fighter were even based off of the Bf-108.
</li><li> Another common substitute for the Bf-109 is the HA-1112, a Spanish-built copy distinguishable by its smile-shaped air intake. Similarly, the CASA 2.111 (an He-111 copy also built in Spain) has been used on a number of occasions to stand in for actual He-111 bombers. Amusingly, both aircraft are powered by the Rolls Royce Merlin - the same engine famously used in such <em>Allied</em> aircraft as the Spitfire and Mustang!
</li></ul></li><li> In "brevity code" (NATO pilot speak) "bogeys" are unidentified aircraft. Hostiles are "<em>bandits</em>".
</li><li> Any large military transport aircraft tends to automatically be referred to as a Hercules. Even if it's a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III">4-engined transport JET.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Any aircraft with one engine and two or four seats is a Cessna according to the news, regardless of its actual manufacturer, although this may have a lot to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandNameTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandNameTakeover">Brand Name Takeover</a>, in the same way that a vacuum cleaner is always referred to as a "hoover" in the UK, for instance.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>'s red Fokker triplane is so iconic because it was already rare and he was the only person who painted his bright red,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08osk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08osk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08osk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were in fact three DR.1 triplanes painted bright red, all of which were earmarked for the Baron's personal use; any time one was down for maintenance or repair, he still had two spares. After his death, the other two were repainted.</span> specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThisIsFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThisIsFor">after the death of his mentor, Oswald Boelcke</a>. This fails to stop stories set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flyboys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flyboys">Flyboys</a></em>, from using them as the standard German plane.
<ul><li> While the Fokker Triplane was iconic, the entire Flying Circus was operating them at the time, having been one of the first squadrons to operate the type. In fact the Fokker Dr1 was in widespread service in the spring of 1918 when Richthofen was killed, and 320 were built before production ended due to their annoying habit of having wing failures. Still, other fighters like the Albatros D.VII were much more common in German service.
</li><li> Also, the origin of the name "Flying Circus" and garish color scheme not just of Manfred von Richthofen's plane but <em>all</em> of the planes in the squadron, was due to a bit of rebellion against authority... an order had come down that aircraft should be camouflaged to disguise their shape/size/configuration etc. but did not specify colors nor that any attempt should be made to have them blend in with the sky or ground (depending on an enemy's vantage point). So as to follow the letter of the order without trying to "hide" the planes (which would be unchivalrous), the bright colors and wild patterns were applied, with no two planes being painted alike. Someone commented that they looked like a circus, and the name was born. The name "Circus" later came to be used by British pilots to refer to any German squadron — in the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles">Biggles</a> stories, written by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> pilot, pilots talk of "so-and-so's circus" having moved in across the lines.
</li></ul></li><li> In reality, a plane that loses power retains its aerodynamic properties and momentum and can be guided down to an emergency landing if the pilot doesn't manage to restart the engines. In fiction, a plane that loses power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">instantly slows to zero speed and plummets.</a> Some types have better glide characteristics than others, but they all <em>can</em> glide without engine power; otherwise they wouldn't be able to fly at all. This is because in the movie-world aerodynamic lift does not exist, and the engines instead condense phlogiston and fill the wings with it. This is also why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">all fuel explodes</a>.
<ul><li> Even something as sizeable and lumbering as a commercial passenger jet can glide for several dozen miles (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Transat_Flight_236">Air Transat Flight 236<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> managed unpowered flight for over 100 miles before making an emergency landing - there were no fatalities) before having to crash-land, and even calling it a "crash landing" in this case can be a misnomer, as a skilled pilot can land a plane in this manner <em>without</em> it exploding into an explosive fiery fireball explosion of flaming exploding death.
</li><li> Also the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider">Gimli Glider (Air Canada Flight 143),<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_9">British Airways Flight 009,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549">US Airways 1549 ("Miracle on the Hudson").<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Helicopters can also glide; it's called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorotation">autorotation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a basic flight maneuver taught to every helicopter pilot. A helicopter that loses engine power does not necessarily spin out of control, break apart, and/or fall out of the sky.
</li></ul></li><li> Many media, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, depict people in passenger jets (in coach) getting up from the window seats sliding past the person in the aisle seat (with feet still on the ground), while the person in the aisle seat continues to sit. In contemporary passenger jets, there is nowhere near enough space for even the skinniest people to do that in coach.
</li><li> An airplane that loses a wing as the result of an accident or combat will roll towards the absent wing. Both wings produce lift; if one disappears, the asymmetric forces will cause this rotation. Now that you know this you will never be able to watch <em>King Kong</em>, <em>Flyboys</em>, <em>Pearl Harbor</em>, or any other movie with CGI air combat sequences again without cringing.
</li><li> Blimps and airships in general are uncommon aircraft, which compounds the utter confusion Hollywood seems to have about them. Unlike an elastic balloon, a blimp simply does <em>not</em> pop if you shoot it or poke a hole in it. The gas inside is barely under any pressure, if it is pressurized at all. Disturbingly, the Goodyear Blimps get shot full of holes all the time (the tiny leaks are so minor they're usually only discovered during maintenance), by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">yahoos</a> who think that it <em>will</em> pop. Also, all modern blimps use inert helium or hot air instead of explosive Hydrogen, specifically to avoid a repeat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHindenburg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHindenburg">The Hindenburg</a> disaster. Even airships and balloons that used flammable hydrogen were notoriously difficult to shoot down because while the airships were full of hydrogen, they didn't contain any of the <em>oxygen</em> needed to sustain combustion, which meant explosions were extraordinarily rare (<em>Hindenberg's</em> fiery destruction is infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItBleedsItLeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItBleedsItLeads">because it was so unusual</a>). Many hydrogen-filled airships were able to limp back to friendly territory and land even after being shot up by Allied pilots.
</li><li> Combat between modern aircraft is often depicted in fiction as taking place within a spitting distance of each other. In reality, the aircraft are generally several miles apart. Even worse, most missiles wouldn't work at the insanely close range depicted by Hollywood. The short-distance missile that most U.S. fighter jets use is the Sidewinder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumrange">which still has a minimum range of 0.6 miles.</a> That's right: Their "emergency shotgun" close-distance weapon is still only good at more than a half-mile away.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1qqfi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1qqfi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1qqfi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Most modern fighters have a gun, which operates when the range is too close for missiles. And even those guns tend to have a range of a kilometer or more.</span>
</li><li> A few films and TV shows tend to depict aircraft and helicopter-mounted rocket pods, especially Russian UB-16-57UMP and UB-32 rocket pods, as machine gun pods.
</li><li> All ATC is referred to as "ground control," presumably because that's where the controllers are. There are actually several "levels," if you will, of air traffic control. Ground is only concerned with movements of vehicles on, well, the surface. Tower owns the runways and immediate surrounding airspace, Approach owns the airspace further out from a busy primary airport (generally 30 miles or so), and Center owns everything else.
</li><li> Starting aircraft engines, particularly older ones, is often complicated and time-consuming. Even in newer aircraft with computers to help manage the process, there are still a series of deliberate steps so pilots can notice and diagnose engine problems before costly damage and/or safety risks occur. In fact, many jets don't even have the ability to start their engines, and have to be hooked up to a "starter cart" on the ground to get the engines spinning. Many piston-engine planes require either a ground crewman turning a starter crank or manually spinning the prop while the pilot does his thing in the cockpit. Aviators often cringe when a film or TV character hops into an aircraft, casually flips a couple of switches, and uneventfully flies away moments later. There are plenty of aircraft that can start without external help, but even those have a <em>much</em> longer startup sequence than you'll generally see on television.

However, they also appear to have an internal gun, which only the Air Force A variant has. They are also seen trying to attack ground targets with AMRAAMs rather than Harpoon missiles or laser guided bombs. Also, the military tries attacking ground targets with F-22 Raptors, despite the fact that F-22s are not designed for a ground attack role and can only carry GPS-guided bombs.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jw8k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jw8k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jw8k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The F-22 thing is at least more excusable for the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">US Air Force</a> has actually used F-22s in the ground attack role, albeit rarely.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em> has an F-22 squadron scrambled in the second episode to attack a Vers Landing Castle. Considering this is a two-kilometer long spaceship/space station that has planted itself firmly in the ground, this is not exactly a job well-suited for the Raptor. In contrast, the same episode later shows a more accurate scenario for the F-22 when a second squadron engages a Vers aircraft transporting a Martian Kataphrakt. The F-22s in this scene initially engage at BVR (beyond visual range) by correctly launching missiles <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note091dv');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note091dv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note091dv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although it's still not as far as they would engage in real life, but we might be able to chalk this up to the fact that the Martians have disrupted Earth's communications and satellites and have a powerful ECM network</span> from an internal missile bay. When the Martian craft closes in to "knife-fight" range with them, they use a starboard-mounted Vulcan cannon. The last F-22 that gets its left wing blown off even rolls toward the missing wing.

The Lightning is long-retired and the one shown is a one-seater. This may well be a jibe at poor British military equipment. The Lightning was also a (very) short-range fighter.
</li><li> An issue of one of DC's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> titles had the hero flying escort for an American aircraft that was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">supposedly</span> taking a captured political leader to stand trial. However, rather than the cargo/passenger plane of whatever size that might have been expected, the aircraft in question was a <em>single-seat</em> F-16.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em>'s modified Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird has an interior that — depending on the artist — looks as large as a fair-sized business jet, easily accommodating seats for five to ten X-Men. The real SR-71 Blackbird is a two-seater, with most of the fuselage presumably given over to fuel tanks and electronics. The X-Men also routinely launch their Blackbird straight up like a rocket from a secret hanger under A SCHOOL in upstate New York. And the neighbours never seem to notice or complain to the FAA about the sonic booms. Later Blackbirds dispense with being based on the SR-71 and use extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">alien technology</a>, allowing them to have whatever characteristics the plot needs without being <em>quite</em> as bad about this trope.

Nor, depending on the artist, even a consistent design from issue to issue. Like the X-Men's SR-71, the Quinjets can blast off from beneath Avengers Mansion in midtown Manhattan without disturbing the neighbours or shattering the glass of every skyscraper in a 20 block radius. According to Tony Stark in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> animated series, despite having the aerodynamic characteristics of a Keurig coffeemaker, they can fly at Mach 8, operate underwater (in the animated version they actually launch via an underwater launch tube that leads to the East River) and even fly in space. And, apparently, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> engines never seem to need refueling. Maybe that's how the X-Men's SR-71 can hold so many people. And despite having the airframe equivalent of mutant superpowers, we're informed by the same <em>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em> animated series that they only cost $20 million apiece, less than the $27 million sticker price of a Bombardier Q400 turboprop passenger plane. One would think $20 <strong>billion</strong> would've been more plausible, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">Tony Stark could still afford it</a>.

And the aircraft was called a MiG-28  no such bird exists due to naming conventions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5jakk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5jakk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5jakk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mikoyan have always built fighters. Back in the Cold War days, in addition to indicating the design bureau ("MiG", "Su", "Tu", "Yak", etc.), Soviet designations made the distinction between fighters and other aircraft; odd numbers were fighters, even ones bombers and everything else (though with specialized ground attack aircraft like the Su-25, the difference did get fuzzy at times, and the iconic "Bear" four-engine heavy bomber inexplicably ended up with the Tu-95 designation, used internally by the design bureau, instead of the official Tu-20 designation issued by the Red Air Force). So there was a MiG-27 and a MiG-29, but no -28. There was at the time no MiG-33 or -35 (the former was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle">Working Title</a> for the MiG-29, the latter a MiG-29 variant that didn't fly until 2007), so either of these names would've been better for a fictional MiG.</span> This may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">somewhat justified</a>, since the alternative of depicting the Tigers as real Soviet planes — of which virtually none at the time looked like the Tiger — would arguably be worse.
</li><li> A pilot uses the missile release button on his control stick to fire his guns, instead of the bright red gun trigger clearly visible any time one of the pilots is shown jerking the stick for a violent maneuver.
</li><li> The pilots evidently gain a missile lock by flying the lead-calculating reticle for the gun onto the target. Suffice it to say, anything in the missile seeker head's field of view (i.e. anything in front of the plane) can be locked simply by selecting the target and letting the missile's software do its thing for about a second, and on an F-14 would be done by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInBack">RIO</a>, not the pilot.
<ul><li> Additionally, the lock tones vary depending on the missile used. Radar-guided missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow, AIM-120 AMRAAM, or the now-retired AIM-54 Phoenix (which only the F-14 could carry) indicate a lock with a continuous low-pitch ringing tone. For the AIM-9 Sidewinder, it's a continuous low-pitched "growl." The movie's "beep-beep-beep-beep-<em>booooooop</em>" is never heard in a real cockpit.
</li></ul></li><li> In the climactic dogfight, Iceman is hit twice by enemy cannon fire, both times leaving a short, neat line of holes in his plane. In reality, fighter cannons fire in bursts of 100 rounds or so to facilitate use in high-speed engagements. A solid hit to the fuselage as depicted, let alone <em>two</em>, would almost certainly have destroyed Iceman's plane. And, of course, cannon shells have explosives inside; that's what makes the gun a cannon!
</li><li> Most of the school/practice battles in <em>Top Gun</em> have planes within rock-throwing distance of each other, an astoundingly unsafe situation as well as being too close for missiles, sensors, guns, and engines to work any more. The plot-crucial engine flameout should've happened about twenty times before it did. Remember that your plane's engine(s) can't breathe exhaust any better than you can. This example at least has some justification: Originally the crew shot fight scenes at realistic engagement distances...only to realize that said scenes would look incredibly boring on film.
</li><li> The A-4 Skyhawks flown by the Top Gun trainers like Viper and Jester are described as being <em>faster</em> than the F-14s flown by the students. The A-4 was a subsonic ground attack plane first flown in <em>1954</em>. Even the later variants produced by the time of the film were incapable of supersonic flight except in a dive. The Tomcat has a maximum speed of ~Mach 2.3. They also have much lower thrust to weight ratios than the F-14 as well and thus lower acceleration as well.
</li><li> To say pilot chatter in the final battle is laughably inaccurate would be an understatement.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a></em>:
<ul><li> The titular presidential VC-25 features an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod">escape pod</a></em>, something that the real plane used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a> does not, and could not possibly, have. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">President Clinton</a> is said to have commented on that inaccuracy when watching the movie.
</li><li> One scene featured some F-15s switching on their afterburners. This caused these fighter jets to <em>instantly</em> jump from subsonic speeds to Mach 2, like Han Solo turning on the hyperdrive. Real afterburners simply provide a greater force of thrust, allowing the aircraft to <em>smoothly accelerate</em> past the compressibility range until it attains a supersonic airspeedthey don't cause Newton's 2nd Law of Motion to be temporarily suspended.
</li><li> Also regarding the Eagles, they repeatedly get missile locks with the Sparrow and AMRAAM radar-homing missiles at ranges far too <em>close</em> for the missile to guide properly. This doesn't apply to the enemy MiG-29 Fulcrums, because they were firing infra-red homing AA-8 "Aphid" and AA-10 "Alamo-B" missiles at AF1. They were just about at the known minimum distance for those missiles.
</li><li> When AF1 charges through Ramstein AFB after the failed landing attempt, it not only wouldn't have gotten back in the air, it would have been torn apart by the overstressing of the landing gear and wings. 747s, especially military E-4s and VC-25s, are tough, but they're not <em>that</em> tough.
</li><li> When the refueling attempt results in a fire involving the KC-10's "flying boom", it would not cause the Extender to explode. They have fuel cutoffs and fire-suppression equipment built into the refueling system to prevent just such an accident. In fact, it's been standard on all USAF tankers since the midair collision between the KC-135 and B-52 that dropped five (still-safed) H-bombs around Palomares, Spain in 1965. That accident began when the two aircraft "bumped" during an in-flight refueling exercise. The Air Force tries not to make the same mistake <em>twice</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Done deliberately in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> where the titular jet is accompanied by a propeller sound effect which is both incongruous and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em>Zero Hour</em>, the B-movie it was based on. The directors did this because the studio wouldn't allow them to use a propeller-drive aircraft.

But of course:
<ul><li> The first movie has a scene in which a motorbike races against a Cessna 152 which obviously has full flap deployed and the throttle almost closed. Given that the Cessna cruises at around 107 knots, almost 200 km/h, this was necessary to make the contest look even remotely fair.
</li><li> The movie also has Kfirs play as MiG-23s, a rather glaring error since MiG-23s are swing-wing, whereas Kfirs are delta-wing. This gets noteworthy when you consider that some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Arab nations operated Mirage V fighters, which the IAI Kfir is visually almost indiscernible from, being an upgrade of an unlicensed copy of the Mirage V - so why not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac">Bilyan Air Force</a>?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6c5ce');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6c5ce" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6c5ce');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Then again, the Marine Corps <em>also</em> leased Kfirs from the IAF to stand in for MiG-23s in dissimilar air combat training (solely because of its similar flight characteristics - the only <em>visual</em> similarity was the "Flogger" paint scheme DACT Kfirs were given), which could be where the producers got the idea from.</span>
</li><li> The F-16s were provided by the Israeli Air Force, and while sporting American national insignia and USAF-like markings, they retained Israeli green-sand-brown camouflage on upper surfaces, which is <em>very</em> different from the USAF (or almost any other F-16 operator's) gray color scheme.
</li><li> In <em>Iron Eagle II</em>, one of the heroes hears planes approaching, starts screaming and yelling "...they're goddamned Soviet MiGs!" and runs out onto the tarmac — to look at a flight of F-4 Phantom IIs, one of the most distinctive American designs out there. The differences between the MiG-29 and the F-4 are glaring from the side and rear (MiG-29s are twin tailed while F-4s are single tailed), but perhaps from the front they looked similar enough to justify their use (i.e. the droopy nose and twin intakes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7oe3b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7oe3b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7oe3b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">ignore the very different shape and placement of said intakes</span>).
</li><li> In Iron Eagle IV, the protagonist is shot down by "MiG-29s" (again, played by F-4 Phantoms)... carrying <em>air to <strong>ground</strong></em> Maverick missiles.
</li></ul></li><li> F-4 Phantoms also stood in for MiG-21s in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IceStationZebra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IceStationZebra">Ice Station Zebra</a></em>, at least during shots where actual aircraft were used - shots filmed using miniatures used models of actual MiG-21s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a> drama <em>The Hunters</em> uses repainted F-84F Thunderstreaks (which entered service too late to see action in Korea, though previous versions with unswept wings did) to play MiG-15s. Those -84s have been popularly known as "ThunderMiGs" ever since.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames">WarGames</a></em>, General Beringer's order to "scramble two F-16s [single engine, one tail and rather small] out of Galena" in response to a phantom Soviet bomber apparently gets garbled somewhere along the way: the aircraft seen moments later are unmistakably F-15s [two engines, two tails and markedly larger than the F-16].
<ul><li> In the early 1980s, when the movie was made, the air force unit likely operating from Galena, Alaska, was the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing (headquartered at Elmendorf AFB, which exercised control over the airfield at Galena as well), part of the 11th Air Force. At this time, 21st TFW was indeed operating the F-15A, having transitioned to the type from F-4 Phantoms in 1982.

The Bf108 is a relatively common civil aircraft (they continued to be built in France after the war as the Nord 1000) that bears an unmistakable family resemblence to the Bf109 fighter.
</li><li> The above is notably averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em> where a Bf108 is actually used to portray the Bf108 which two of the escapees steal from a training field.
</li><li> Harvards (better known as T-6 Texans or SNJs) with bits glued on were used to represent fighter bombers in <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">The C-47s used for that film were real C-47s, however</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Or possibly repainted DC-3s</a>, which are basically the same thing.
<ul><li> Virtually all DC-3s ever built were actually C-47s. 600 DC-3s were built before the war by Douglas; after the war the surviving majority of the nearly <em>fifteen thousand</em> C-47s were sold into civilian service, saturating the market for twin-engine propeller airliners.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MemphisBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MemphisBelle">Memphis Belle</a></em> is another example of an intensive effort being made to bring together actual vintage aircraft for an accurate filming; in that movie's case, most of the world's surviving B-17s. Note you never see more than 3 actual (as opposed to models or CGI) B-17s at a time. If one watches carefully, you can at times see that many of the bombers have two separate sets of nose art and markings  one on each side of the fuselage  allowing each plane to play two different bombers in the formation.
<ul><li> P-51 escorts are glimpsed in the aerial battle scenes; they did not arrive in-theater until November 1943, six months after the film's date in May. Moreover, they have to turn back halfway through the trip, which is ridiculous because the entire reason they took over the role of bomber escort in reality was because they <em>did</em> have the range to escort a B-17 all the way to Germany and back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor">Pearl Harbor</a></em>:
<ul><li> At one point in the eponymous battle, a character states that "We can't outrun Zeros, we'll have to out-fly them!" The American P-40 could easily outrun the Zero, but didn't have a prayer if they tried to out-turn the Zero, one of the most amazingly maneuverable (but relatively slow) fighter aircraft of the war. Note however that U.S. Airmen were remarkably ignorant about the Zero's capabilities in 1941; accurate reports out of China were dismissed as exaggerated. About the only correct thing they did know about the Zero was its "Type 00" designation, the "Zeke" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingName">Reporting Name</a> not being issued until late 1942. And the Zero wasn't that much slower than the P-40 in level flight, only in a dive. Basically, P-40s taking off under fire, in a low-energy state (low and slow) would be torn apart by Zeroes...which is exactly what happened in real life.
</li><li> In addition, the CGI P-40s' control surfaces didn't move. Possibly the other aircraft too, but there were a number of gratuitous beauty shots of the P-40s that made it obvious.
</li><li> They got actual flying Zeroes with the proper engines and everything - then painted them <em>with Imperial Army markings.</em> The Japanese army <em>never</em> flew the Mitsubishi A6M, instead favoring the lighter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even more maneuverable</a>, Nakajima Ki-43, called the <em>Hayabusa</em> (Peregrine Falcon) by the Japanese and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingNames">"Oscar"</a> by the Allies. Moreover, the Zeroes present in the attack on Pearl Harbor (when they're not shifting into D3A1 "Val" dive-bombers between camera angles) are painted green; the real Imperial Japanese Navy painted Zeroes grey in 1941, with the green paint scheme not being used until '43. 
</li><li> The B-25s for the Doolittle raid are wrong too - in several scenes they have the dorsal turrets well towards the front as in all B-25s past the G model. The Doolittle raid used the earlier B model; the B-25G was not produced until a year after the raid. Also, while the B-25 is a fairly easy aircraft to fly, the real pilots/copilots were all experienced multi-engine bomber pilots with hundreds of hours in B-25s and a thorough knowledge of exactly how they flew and handled under every imaginable condition, not single-engine fighter pilots who didn't even bother with Type-Transition training. The takeoff sequence includes a dramatic scene of a B-25 dropping below view and almost crashing before lifting up. With one exception, every B-25 was lifting off before reaching the end of the flight deck (the one exception had the flaps set incorrectly), due to the aircraft carrier travelling at 25 MPH into a 40 MPH headwind; the B-25 has a stall speed of 80 MPH, meaning they only needed an additional speed of 15 MPH to take off.
</li><li> The "Battle of Britain" scene is full of glaring errors. The Spitfires used are clearly Mk.V or Mk.IX Spits, the former of which did not reach frontline service until 1941, by which time large-scale air raids such as the one depicted would have ceased. The cannons are a dead giveaway, especially since the Hispano II cannon was not introduced until 1941 either. Secondly, they are all marked with "RF", designation of No. 303 Squadron, one of the most prominent <em>Polish</em> squadrons in the Battle, yet here, there are multiple American and British pilots! Regarding the American pilots, only seven were officially active during the Battle, anyway, and they would likely have been split between several squadrons. At one point, an He-111's cockpit <em>explodes</em> after being hit with just a single shell. Moreover, none of the Spitfire pilots are actually wearing their oxygen masks, which contain their microphones, so any communication would be incredibly difficult. When Affleck fires his guns, he <em>only</em> uses the cannons despite standard practice being to correct your aim using expendable machinegun fire before spending cannon shells. The Bf-109s that attack them are clearly not the standard Bf-109 E, since the Bf-109 E had distinct flattened wingtips not seen on the plane in the film. A lot of the fighting is done at obscenely close range, when in reality, RAF standard procedure was to open fire between 250 and 500 yards (200m to 400m) from their target, though the Free Polish airmen of 303 Squadron were noted for being more aggressive and got in closer. (The legend at the time was that British pilots generally wanted to shoot down their German opponents, while the Polish exiles wanted to <em>kill</em> them. In reality, it was because the Poles were trained to get much closer before opening fire because the Polish air force flew much slower aircraft, but it gave them such a reputation for fearsomeness the legend went uncontested.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailSafe">Fail Safe</a></em>, planes are ordered to hit their afterburners. The film then cuts to stock footage of what is clearly a bunch of planes firing missiles instead.
</li><li> In the first Hollywood remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla</a></em>, the military aircraft are portrayed inaccurately:
<ul><li> Apache helicopters have fixed, side-mounted guns (as opposed to the swiveling nose-mounted gun of a real Apache) and Sidewinder anti-aircraft heat seeking missiles - while the Apache <em>can</em> mount them, they never do, since in any engagements where the Apache would be expected to carry air-to-air munitions for defending against other aerial targets, it makes more sense to carry four AIM-92 Stingers rather than two Sidewinders.
<ul><li> The Apaches in the film also have longer stub-wing pylons, each with an extra hardpoint mounting two more Hydra rocket pods, as well as a span-like structure going from the engine cowlings to the wing pylons, giving them a rather strange Hind-like front profile.
</li></ul></li><li> Towards the end of the film, Godzilla is attacked by an F/A-18 using Harpoon anti-ship missiles. While Godzilla may be large enough for a radar guided missile like the Harpoon to lock onto, the missile would certainly not work over land. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8v5uj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8v5uj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8v5uj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is because land, being full of solid stuff, creates a very chaotic radar picture. By comparison the ocean is quite flat and smooth and makes it pretty easy for a missile to find a target, necessitating a rather different seeker design.</span> There is a land attack version of the Harpoon that would be well suited for a target like Godzilla, but it entered service two years after the movie was released.
</li><li> In the follow-up strike on the "hatchlings" at Madison Square Garden, the cockpit dialogue regarding the missiles is even more inaccurate. The lead pilot states they are using the laser (designator) and "going with LGBs" (Laser-Guided Bombs, aka "Paveways") - but the weapon select display clearly shows and says "Harpoon Armed". Then, just before launching, he says, "Use the Mavericks" - which is an entirely different air-to-surface missile. What come "off the rails" on all three Hornets, though, are indeed Harpoons.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker">Moonraker</a></em>. The sequence in which a space shuttle blasts off from the aircraft carrying it.
<ul><li> The shuttle is never carried with fuel or live batteries. Even if Drax somehow arranged for them to be onboard, the Shuttle is basically a glider — its engine and onboard fuel aren't enough to fly it any great distance as if it were a regular jet plane.
</li><li> It is also impossible to carry a shuttle on the back of a normal 747, even if you could add a cradle on top. The turbulence caused by it renders the normal rudder basically useless (the NASA 747 used to ferry the shuttles had additional vertical steering surfaces installed at the ends of the horizontal tail surfaces for this reason). The other problems can be hand-waved with this being something more like an earlier design, which included air-breathing jet engines with a significant internal fuel store. You'd still never get enough fuel on board it without it being noticed to be overweight when it was loaded on the carrier, or at the very least when the carrier was being pre-flighted and the crew noticed the landing gear was reading thousands of pounds more weight than it should be. Additionally, if the shuttle firing its engines while attached to the 747 causes the latter to explode, why does the 747 have an indicator in the cockpit for 'Shuttle Ignition' as if they were <em>expecting it to happen sometime</em>?

</li><li> The MiG pilot killed when his unresponsive aircraft augurs in after the first EMP (hammering his fist on the canopy in a vain attempt to escape) should have pulled his ejection handle. Aircraft ejection seats are specifically designed to function with no power source of any kind, and are largely immune to EMP, the phenomenon being reasonably well-understood as an effect of nuclear weapons detonations. Even systems with electronic initiation have a backup system. As a rule, much more concern is spent making sure the ejection seat doesn't go off when it <em>shouldn't</em>, such as when the plane is on the ground.

<ul><li> The Chinese planes that attack the stray British ship are repeatedly described as "Chinese MiGs". Although China does have MiGs, these aren't them; the aircraft are clearly recognizable as Q-5s, an indigenous Chinese type (admittedly partly based on MiG-19 technology, but very different in appearance). Apparently a case of the special effects department doing better research than the scriptwriters.
</li><li> And a Qian-5 that drops a torpedo would be an extraordinary beast. They should have used the Chinese Harbin-5 bomber, based on the Ilyushin-28.
</li><li> In the teaser, when the Royal Navy frigate fires the cruise missile at the terrorist "flea market", M tells 007 he has four minutes to get clear. The target is 400 miles from the ship. A Tomahawk cruise missile (as shown) has a top speed of about 550 miles per hour. It should have taken the missile about <em>43</em> minutes to get there. The novelization blows it even more thoroughly, with a Harpoon missile being launched, and traveling <em>800</em> miles in 4 minutes 8 seconds. First of all, a Harpoon (an <em>antiship</em> missile) has a maximum range of less than 100 miles, and second, it travels at about the same (determinedly subsonic) speed as the Tomahawk. To do 800 miles in 248 seconds, it would have needed to achieve about 11,600 miles per hour, or about 3.2 miles per second - about half of Earth's <em>escape velocity</em>. Also, any object traveling that fast at low altitude would burn up like a meteor hitting the lower atmosphere - plus what the shock wave effects would do to anything along its path on the <em>ground</em>.

<ul><li> One scene features a prototype "Skyfleet S570", possibly intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Bland-Name Product</a> version of the then-new Airbus A380. The actual plane we see, however, is obviously a Boeing 747 with external fuel tanks hanging from the wings (specifically, it's the decommissioned 747 that lives on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> test track). This makes very little sense for any civilian aircraft.

It also uses its VTOL capacity to make a hovering attack. You <em>could</em> do this, but you'd run out of fuel really fast.

The <em>Air Force</em> using F/A-18s in the climactic battle at the end? The Israeli Air Force (IAF) with F/A-18 Hornets??
<ul><li> If you freeze-frame during the part of the final battle when all the fighter planes are forming up, you can see a couple of Harriers, A-10s and F-16s in the mix, however that's the only time you ever see them and they're way in the background. They only budgeted for one extreme-detail fighter CG-model. Guess which one? Yup. The F/A-18. That's why there was such a fuckload of just those for the finale.
</li><li> The number of F/A-18s flying in the final battle was more than have ever existed at any time in history. And this was <em>after</em> the aliens shot down the entire first counterattack earlier in the movie.
</li><li> The novelization is a little more realistic in this department. Eagle squadron (the one the president commands) is formed of F-15s found stored at a "satellite" base part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51">Area 51</a> complex. They are in a grave state of disrepair and several have to be cannibalized to make the others flightworthy, so that only about 8 fly in the actual battle. The rest of the force is formed from what ever they can find, including Russian fighters (acquired through various means during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> for study at Area 51, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> actually), and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> fighters (a P-51 is mentioned). During the battle the planes are split into two groups: the shooters, modern American planes, and the decoys, Russian and other planes for which ammunition did not exist on base. The latter group was meant to go in first and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">attract the attention of the alien fighters and draw them off</a>, allowing the former group to close in and open fire.
</li><li> During the film's climax, Eagle Twenty announces "Fox Two", which is NATO code for the launch of an infrared guided missile, but the missile shown is an AIM-120 AMRAAM, an active radar guided missile that would be launched with "Fox Three."
</li><li> The attack on the alien ship with AMRAAMs and Sidewinders in itself is another example, considering the sheer size of the target. Even the biggest air-to-air missiles in reality only have a 75-kilogram warhead - not much threat to a ship the size of a city. Air-to-ground weapons are closer to 500 kilos... or since the F/A-18 is cleared for the whole gamut of US Navy aircraft weapons, they could have led with something even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">bigger</a></em>. Not that this would really have helped, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">the entire nuclear arsenal of the world could only vaporise less than 1% of the volume of one of the saucers</a>.
<ul><li> Never mind the question of whether or not the missiles' guidance systems (programmed to look for airplanes) could actually recognize the damn thing as a target to be engaged rather than a mountain to be avoided.
</li></ul></li><li> The original ending for the film sees Russell being denied a place in the final counter attack against the aliens. So he takes one of the Air Force's missiles, straps it to his biplane and sends it into the cannon. If this was to be attempted in reality, the plane would stall on its way up, making it the most awkward self sacrifice in history.

In real life, the F-22 cannot carry any laser guided missiles; it is designed to use GPS-guided bombs for air-to-ground attacks. Also, freaking jet powered Predator. While the C variant of the Predator is jet powered, it also has substantially redesigned wings and fuselage. Putting a jet engine in a Predator B frame and putting it through the maneuvers in the movie would probably have snapped the wings off. The first scene in the film also has an army spec-ops team return to base on V-22 Ospreys but the interior shots appear to be from CH-47 Chinook.

</li><li> <em>Charlie Wilson's War</em> used stock footage to depict Soviet fighters getting shot down. In several scenes, the fighters are obviously either F-16s or foreign variants, not Soviet planes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWaldoPepper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWaldoPepper">The Great Waldo Pepper</a></em>, two relatively common Tiger Moth biplanes were wrecked in the crash scenes, standing in for the much rarer Standard J-1. Ironically, most sources about the film mistakenly identify the Standard J-1s actually used in the movie as the smaller (but more famous) Curtis JN-1 "Jenny". Tallmantz aviation, like most real Barnstormers, preferred the Standard because it was larger, stronger, and used a more reliable engine.

The aircraft's tail number (license plate)? Canadian registration. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">Location shooting indeed...</a>

Apparently, the USAF has developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">TARDIS technology</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em> the portrayal of the Harrier jet is highly erroneous. Harriers are not designed to hover as long as it did in the film, are not bulletproof, and would be unflyable if it got its instrument panel shot up like it did.
<ul><li> Also, exactly how does Arnold avoid <em>getting sucked into the intake &amp; <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_object_damage">FODing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the damn engine</em>?
</li><li> If a man were to be snagged on the forward fins of one of its missiles, it would immediately be directed downward by the weight pulling on it. Said weight would also ensure that the missile wouldn't have anywhere near the power or maneuverability to bring itself back on course, and would most likely slam into the ground.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock">The Rock</a></em>, a flight of Air Force F/A-18 Hornets are sent on a bombing mission when it appears that the heroes have failed to neutralize the threat. The Air Force does not use F/A-18s in real life; only the Navy and the Marine Corps do. This was strange considering that the rest of the movie focused on the Marines and Navy.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the closeups of the F/A-18s display the squadron logo of VMFA-314, a Marine Corps squadron,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1013zl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1013zl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1013zl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in fact the "Black Knights", the same squadron mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em></span> yet also have "U.S. Air Force" painted prominently on their sides.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in, of all things, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em>: not only was the B-52 correct in exterior shots (save for casting the shadow of a B-17), the B-52's cockpit avionics, especially the arming console, shown were so accurate that the Air Force freaked out (the bomber's interior was still classified). As it happened, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Kubrick</a> and his crew had simply done an amazing job of extrapolation.
</li><li> <em>The Concorde: Airport '79</em> (also known as <em>Airport 80</em> because it wasn't released until 1980 in some countries) was full of such howlers:
<ul><li> When the Concorde is being chased by heat-seeking missiles, George Kennedy <em>opens a window</em> in the cockpit, then leans out into the onrushing <em>supersonic</em> air and fires a flare gun. The force should have ripped the window housing open, and torn Kennedy's arm off.
</li><li> In the course of dodging the heat-seeking missiles, the Concorde's engines flame out. The plane immediately nosedives <em>straight down</em>, plummeting like a rock. In the real world, when an airliner (even a supersonic one) loses power, it becomes a glider. It won't have the best glide performance in the world, but it's still going to be <em>gliding</em>, not falling (this was how <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider">Air Canada Flight 143<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> managed to make it to the decommissioned RCAF Station Gimli runway while out of fuel).
</li><li> It also lines up with the runway a few kilometers short of threshold, and only then does anyone (including airport tower) notice there's a multicoloured hot air balloon over the runway. Or the F-4 Phantom pilot somehow failing to shoot down an <em>airliner</em> with either missiles or guns for four entire minutes. Or a civilian runway equipped with barricade webbing large enough for an entire airliner. Or continuing the flight a few hours after two independent attempts to shoot down the plane (one a supposed accident, but the other involving a fucking <em>fighter plane</em> going after it) plus making an emergency landing and barely averting a runway overrun. Or the magic door-opening machine that punches in an access code by making the keypad <em>push itself</em>. Or that the same device also somehow operates the Concorde's fuel jettison pumps from the cargo bay.
</li><li> There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">Call a Rabbit a "Smeerp"</a> of the "Buzzard Attack Drone." We generally call a target-seeking UCAV which carries a single warhead a <em>missile</em>, guys (unless we're playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Battles</a></em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em>: The legendary Hollywood stunt pilot Frank Tallman put together an entire squadron of 24 B-25 bombers for the film. Even the camera plane was a B-25 with a special optical glass nose. It's been said that part of the reason so many B-25s are still flying today and not scrapped is because they were made flyable for this movie.

<ul><li> The F/A-37s would never be able to take off from a carrier. Aside from being based on a somewhat dubious concept aircraft which would likely have trouble transitioning between wing angles, there's the minor issue that they're apparently all but VTOL-capable, swing-wing CATOBAR aircraft with comically gigantic missile loadouts and utterly insane range; there's no way an aircraft with such a laundry list of capabilities would be able to take off from a standard <em>Nimitz</em> catapult, and it's doubtful if it could do so at all, especially not with the stated empty weight of nine metric tons for a 70-foot aircraft. And even if all that weren't true, there's the small matter of their rear landing gear being secured to the carrier's deck with tie-down chains when they're on the catapult. Although it's worth mentioning Northrop-Grumann believed the aerodynamic concept might be feasible and as such has taken steps to ensure they had complete control over the forward swept swing wing design for the next two decades by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=iRQXAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">patenting it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 2000.
</li><li> There's also the infamous exploding plane scene, where Jessica Biel punches out seconds before her plane explodes. Next, the pilotless-but-still-in-one-piece plane twists around and starts <em>barreling after her</em> (although it <em>had</em> been twisting around before she hit the eject). <strong>Then</strong> it explodes, and an enormous cloud of wreckage chases her down. The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">Ludicrous Gibs</a>" level of debris rather suggests she was carrying a Lockheed C-130 troop transport in her missile bay.
</li><li> Slightly less obvious but equally hilarious is how the F/A-37s are shown to outfly Su-37s using exactly the kind of cool supermaneuver <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ALt3m3Kkhw">those very Su-37s introduced in real life<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Somehow, the Russian pilots only know how to fly in straight lines.
</li><li> Made even worse when you know that those very same maneuvers are reserved for airshows and technology demonstration, and that no competent pilot would actually be stupid enough to attempt one in an actual dogfight. Made even more worse (worser?) that they are in a dogfight at all, when both sides are equipped with Beyond Visual Range missile technology, which means dogfighting is your last resort, not your go-to strategy for an engagement. Or the fact the non-stealth Faux-37s weren't even detected until they were only 25 miles out, etc. There's also the fact that these Su-37s are shown as two-seaters, when the only two Su-37s in the real world only have room for the pilot.
</li><li> The F/A-37's cockpit has more elbow room than do passengers on commercial jets. A bit more forgivably, the joystick is in a between-the-legs placement; most American jets since the F-16 have a side stick.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MegaSharkVsGiantOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MegaSharkVsGiantOctopus">Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus</a></em> actually has a shapeshifting fighter jet due to the poor use of stock footage. In one shot the jet is an F-15, in another shot it is an F/A-18, and in yet another shot the same jet is an F-22.
</li><li> The problem of acquiring Soviet bloc aircraft prior to the end of the Cold War is also encountered with helicopters. <em>Ersatz</em> Soviet helicopters include:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">A View to a Kill</a></em>: the Soviet helicopter that chases Bond in the pre-title sequence is a (West) German MBB-105.

The fake front fuselage apparently made it stunningly hard to actually fly. This ended up being carried over to all of the video games, licensed or fan-made.
<ul><li> SA 330s stood in for Hind-As in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984">Red Dawn</a></em>, as well, though they actually got close to early model Hinds at least in the forward fuselage.

</li><li> It didn't stop after the dissolution of the USSR, either. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em>, the "Russian" twin-rotor helicopter that picks up Nick Tatapoulos (Matthew Broderick) from Chernobyl is an American Piasecki H-21 "Workhorse". It is dated to the 1950s, and it was one of only two flyable ones left in the world. Today, there are exactly four- all in museums. And no, no Russian bird, not even a twin-rotor, ever looked very much like the H-21, often nicknamed the "Flying Banana".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rare aversion: Elasti-girl's radio dialogue when the missiles are closing in on her plane is actually accurate, since her use of "Buddy Spike" makes sense in context since she believes the island to be friendly and the term is used to warn the "spiker" that the radar lock was from a friendly and can be disregarded. The only goof is that it was a ground radar, and the proper term for a ground radar threat indication is "Mud" followed by a clock direction.
</li><li> Also, the tail number — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIronGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIronGiant">IG99</a> — is invalid for an American-registered aircraft.
</li></ul></li><li> A less egregious but more obvious example is from <em>Beyond the Time Barrier</em>, where the F-102 changes side numbers between takeoff &amp; landing. (The effects of jumping ahead in time?)

The best part is, in order to evade a heat-seeking missile, Murdock switches off the engine of the helicopter for a moment  the fact that there would <em>still</em> be a significant heat signature notwithstanding.
</li><li> The fight scene with the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper">Reaper drones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is utter nonsense. A Reaper couldn't intercept the A-Team's plane to begin with: the normal cruising speed of a C-130 is 336 mph (540 km/h) but the Reaper tops out at about 300 mph (482 km/h). Also, they aren't armed with machine guns, only missiles (and air-to-ground missiles at that), nor are they capable of the dogfighting-level maneuverability seen in the tank scene. They're designed for long loiter time in low-velocity flight, and are known to lose their connection to the satellite if they bank too hard to right or left.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em>  the German Fighters shown in the film are not period planes but Swiss-made Pilatus P-2 aircraft built after World War II.
<ul><li> Probably an example of using what's available. The Pilatus P-2 looks a lot like the Arado 96, the standard Luftwaffe advanced trainer of the war years (probably because after the war, several of Arado's designers went to Switzerland and were hired by... you guessed it, Pilatus). And quite a few Ar-96s had bomb racks and twin synchronized 7.9mm machine guns in the cowling, as shown in the film, for armaments training. The use of a pair of armed trainers for the mission (shooting up the Jones boys) may just have been a case of a training unit being the closest available air asset when the orders came down the chain of command.
</li><li> A more glaring issue is the crash of one of the planes; it attempts to follow Indy and his father into a tunnel, but unfortunately the tunnel is just slightly too narrow for the plane, resulting in its wings getting sheared off. Then, through some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">miraculous act of momentum</a>, the plane, sliding on its belly, actually manages to <em>overtake</em> the car it is chasing and exit through the other side of the tunnel before conveniently exploding. Apparently it was customary back then to coat the roadway within tunnels with vaseline.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereEaglesDare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereEaglesDare">Where Eagles Dare</a></em> - In the climax, when Smith's team is escaping from Oberhausen airfield in the Ju-52, the trainers shown in Luftwaffe markings are North American T-6 Texans. The Luftwaffe did in fact have such trainers, captured from the Belgian Air Force in the 1940 blitzkrieg of the Low Countries and France. Likewise with the T-6 Texans seen at the airfield in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em>.
<ul><li> <em>Where Eagles Dare</em> still slips up by using a Bell Model 47— an American helicopter that <em>hadn't even been built</em> when the movie takes place— to represent a German helicopter, possibly meant to be a Flettner Fl-282.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>, Lex Luthor is stranded on an island with an out-of-fuel helicopter, and wishes he had just a <em>quart</em> of gasoline. The helicopter in question, however, was an AW109, which has twin turboshaft engines. Turboshafts are to helicopters what turboprops are to airplanes, and like the latter, they run on Jet-A (kerosene), not avgas (gasoline).
<ul><li> Besides, a single quart of fuel would barely be enough to warm the engines up to proper operating temperatures, much less take off and fly for any appreciable distance.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Interceptor Force 2</em>, the Russian fighters are called MiG-29s. They're really MiG-25s.
</li><li> <em>Interceptor</em> (1993). There are supersonic, highly-agile F-117s that launch Sidewinder missiles out of the nose gear wheel well and have folding wings, which can deploy in flight after falling out of the back of a C-5. Also, the engines can somehow start by themselves without pneumatics, AND somehow not have a compressor stall during the aforementioned free fall. Then there's the KC-10 that the bad guys use to board the C-5 in flight, by sliding down the inside of the refueling boom and cutting through the fuselage above the crew rest compartment. Then there's the C-5, where 90% of the movie takes place. Apparently they were allowed to film the scenes on a real C-5, but no C-5 has all the air ducts and crawlspaces that this one has. The terrorists also siphon fuel from the 5 to the 117s from inside the cargo bay, in flight. And at the climax, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarisaPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarisaPinto">blown up</a> with a Sidewinder. Empty fuel tanks notwithstanding, a C-5 has taken a missile hit on takeoff in real life, and only lost the engine the missile was locked on to. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityisUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityisUnrealistic">It circled around and landed safely.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill2008">The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)</a></em>, the "sphere" and robot sitting in Central Park are attacked by Predator UCAVs, armed with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and Hellfire anti-armor missiles, said UCAVs being flown by U.S. Army operators. First of all, the Army doesn't fly Predators, they belong to the U.S. Air Force (and the CIA, but we don't talk about that). Second, when the order to launch is given, the operators fire the Sidewinders, which are infra-red homing air-to-air missiles with relatively small annular blast-fragmentation warheads intended to shred fighter aircraft like a duck hit by birdshot. Not only are such light warheads useless against what is pretty obviously a pair of heavily-armored targets, they aren't generating enough heat to let the missiles' infra-red guidance systems lock on to them to begin with. In such a situation, the Sidewinder will "go dumb", and probably miss, and even if it hits, it won't accomplish much. And since the operators were supposed to be from the Army, you'd think they'd know enough to use the Hellfires, which are <em>intended</em> for use on heavily-armored ground targets (like tanks, for instance) when shooting at the equivalent of a small warship.
</li><li> In the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em>, Robby Jackson's crash is changed rather significantly from the book, becoming only a very minor point with an entirely different cause.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, they transitioned first to the Bell P-39 Airacobra (for all of a month or so), then to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and <em>then</em> to the North American P-51<em>C</em> Mustang. The most identifiable difference between the C and D models of the Mustang is that the C has a conventional "razorback" canopy more reminiscent of the P-40 Warhawk, while the D has the bubble canopy that the fighters are most often depicted with.

</li><li> <em>Red Tails</em> also provides the curious insight that you can open a B-17's bomb bay doors by setting the fuel mix for the number 3 engine to the idle cutoff position. The real bomb bay door control is not in the cockpit or particularly dramatic looking.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Sudden Death</em>, the villain's JetRanger tilts back and goes vertically down into the stadium with its tail straight down and nose up in one of the silliest-looking copter crashes ever filmed. This is impossible with the rotors still spinning. Since they provide lift, upon going nose-up the JetRanger should've just spun out of control backwards due to the force of the rotor wash now pushing horizontally instead of vertically. In addition, the rate of descent is slow - a full 58 seconds from when it first starts descending to when its tail first hits the ice.
</li><li> In the Japanese film <em>Storm Over The Pacific</em>, the Zeroes are painted green. This did not happen until 1944, 3 years after Pearl Harbor.
</li><li> In any number of low budget films where aviation is not of the essence, mistakes are rampant:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetOfAThousandDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetOfAThousandDreams">Street Of A Thousand Dreams</a></em>, a man takes a flight from the US to Baghdad. The plane which takes off is a three rear-engine 727, while the plane that lands is a four winged-engine 707. From there, he's taken to the local Baghdad airport to take a small plane to Basrah. All of the planes there have N numbers, which is the designation applied to US planes.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoffeeTeaOrMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoffeeTeaOrMe">Coffee Tea Or Me</a></em>, the stewardesses take off in a 727 and land in a 707 (seems to be a pattern here).
</li></ul></li><li> The CGI flying sequences were were spot on, but the scriptwriters for The Aviator (2004) just used random aviation terms in any dialogue between Howard Hughes and Odie. Interwar-era biplanes did not produce reverse thrust, for example.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth">Battlefield Earth</a></em>, the heroes find a hangar full of Harriers, all of which aren't used for a <strong>millennium</strong>. Nothing should be working after about a millennium, it takes years, not weeks to learn to fly a plane, none of them have flight-suits and yet they're all stunt dogfighter material. On the positive side, they <em>do</em> mention that Harrier jets can hover. Note that Harriers are so unreliable that the fact that they can even be repaired is implausible.
</li><li> In the low-budget film <em>American Warship</em>, CGI of a South Korean fighter desperately evading attack switches repeatedly between being an F-15 and an F-16. Also shown is stock footage of a C-130 Hercules dropping bombs... from a ventral bay. The C-130, is of course a cargo plane and, aside from literally shoving the near-car sized BLU-82 "daisy cutter" directly out the back of its cargo bay, can't drop bombs at all.
</li><li> In the film <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>:
<ul><li> The good guys get strafed at one point by a German fighter plane. The actual plane was an F4U Corsair, which was an American fighter plane mainly used by the Marines in the Pacific.
</li><li> At least in the close-up shots, the aircraft are models of Ju-87 Stukas, precisely the type of dive-bomber that would have been used at the time. The recce plane that spots the heroes earlier on, however, is definitely American rather than German, since the production had the help of the Greek army and navy — who happened to have a lot of surplus American hardware on hand.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em>, the F-22 Raptors are shown firing two guns, but the production craft only has one (on the right side). At least the tracer rounds are coming from the right spot.
</li><li> Averted in Canadian film <em>Arrow</em> which used a very accurate fiberglass replica of the real CF-105 interceptor built by an enthusiast. Rumor has that, when the completed prototypes were being destroyed in the movie— which is why no real Arrow survives today—the film crew actually cut up the replica they were using to pieces, to the dismay of the guy who built (and still owned) it.
</li><li> Averted and played straight in the 1938 film <em>Test Pilot</em>. One of the planes used was a Y1B-17 that crashes in the movie and the studio got permission from the United States Army to use one for some, but not all, of the scenes. They had to use a modified DC-2 as a stand in at times because the Army was quite understandably skittish about letting a movie studio have free reign with a very expensive heavy bomber prototype that was still under evaluation. The first production B-17 wouldn't make its maiden flight until over a year after the film was released.

<ul><li> The aircraft where the main part of the film takes place is in peril because one of the landing gear won't retract; the cause is given to be a wheel blocker left accidentally in place by the ground crew. Such thing would cause serious problems during taxiing and/or takeoff roll and would be instantly noticed by the pilots.
</li><li> When the landing gear indicator is shown in close-up, there are three green lights and one red. This indicates the exactly opposite situation as the one we're told about, as green light indicates the gear is down and locked and red light means it is completely retracted.
</li><li> The pilots state that they can't land because no airport would accept them. There's absolutely no explanation as to why no airport wants to allow an emergency landing, which is an obvious violation of regulations. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13j1tj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13j1tj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13j1tj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It would be somewhat understandable in case of a biological problem onboard - say, an outbreak of a rabid contagious disease - but not when there's a purely mechanical problem.</span> Furthermore, even if the Spanish airports are unavailable for some convoluted reason, with the amount of fuel they have onboard - the flight was from Madrid to Mexico City - there are literally dozens of alternative airports capable of dealing with an A340 in peril within their range - Rome-Fiumicino, Milan-Linate, Lisbon-Portela, Paris-CDG/Orly/Le Bourget, Frankfurt, London-Heathrow, Zurich-Kloten, Vienna, Prague, Warsaw-Chopin are just some examples.

However the aircraft is portrayed by a Lockheed Hudson bomber, a light bomber/attack plane primarily used by the RAF. The Hudson was a relatively conventional-looking twin-engined aircraft. The plane chosen to assist the actual Cabanatuan raid was a North American P-61 Black Widow, a heavily-armed, radar-equipped night fighter with a much more unusual twin-boom fuselage not unlike the P-38 Lightning.

The real planes involved in the "Con Air" transport system are little different from regular commercial planes, and there are no cells.

</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleOfBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleOfBritain">Battle of Britain</a></em>. British aircraft were portrayed by actual Spitfires and Hurricanes, though typically variants that entered service later in the war. On the German side, the Bf-109s and He-111s were played by HA-1112s and CASA 2.111s, respectively - Spanish-built copies whose most noteworthy difference from the original designs is that they were both powered by the same Rolls Royce Merlin engines as the British planes!

Not only does American not fly to Manila, there are no direct flights from New York to Manila. This flight also uses a Boeing 747, a type that does not form part of American's fleet (also, external shots of the plane are of a 747, whilst the internal ones are of a 777).

Protagonist Rayford Steele laments that he's been turned down as pilot of Air Force One, and someone mentions that he's applied for the job with each new president. The problem is, he's a <em>commercial</em> airline pilot. Air Force One is a military aircraft operated by the USAF and has always been piloted by, at lowest rank, a lieutenant colonel. The President himself also laments at one point having to give up Air Force One, as if the designation is for a specific aircraft - "Air Force One" actually applies to any Air Force craft currently carrying the President, rather than specifically referring to the VC-25s most commonly used for this purpose (of which there are two, anyway, so even giving up one would still leave him with another).
<ul><li> "Air Force One" in the series is stated to be a brand new top of the line airplane, the 757. Except the Boeing 757 already exists in the real world, and has since 1982, thirteen years before the series started. It's clear the authors thought of the popular 747 and imagined one model later. In our world, the 757 is smaller than the 747, intended for medium range flights. That said, there <em>is</em> a 757 that sees regular use as Air Force One— it's called the VC-32 and it's used for short-distance flights to airports that can't handle a 747.

</li><li> "Echoes of the Past" has, for some reason, an F-100 Super Sabre pop up in a shot that's meant to be of two MiG-19s. The two are similar in appearance and function (both were their country's first supersonic fighters).
</li><li> "To Snare an Airwolf" has a US satellite launch done with footage of a Saturn V launchand the actual satellite using a clip of <em>Skylab</em>, which had re-entered the atmosphere in 1979, five years before the episode was made.
</li><li> "Proof Through the Night" has Airwolf approach a USAF refuelling tanker, which is fine, and has the copilot asking why they're using a refuelling setup for aircraft with a refuelling probe. Several errors are made: the pilot and copilot believe the choices are a Harrier or SR-71 Blackbird, forgetting that all USN carrier aircraft use refuelling probes (the probes on the Tomcat and Hornet fold away when not in use). Secondly, they're using a "male" boom refuler, instead of the hose-and-drogue setup. The male boom plugs into the aircraft, and can't fit a refueling probe. Third, the crew is shocked to be refueling a helicopter... Except that at that time, the Air Force was deploying MH-53J Pave Low III and HH-60G Pave Hawk search and rescue choppers, which DID have refuelling probes, and were regularly refueled by USAF tankers.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied (like everything else) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AngieTribeca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AngieTribeca">Angie Tribeca</a></em>. A Boeing 767 seen at an airport terminal suddenly turns into a badly animated two-seater biplane when in the air. Interior shots show a wide-body jet, but cockpit scenes include the loud buzzing of an old prop engine. And it's so long that it takes Angie several minutes to run the length of the plane...
</li><li> The landing sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em> from the episode <em>The Beast from the Belly of the Boeing</em> was largely accurate for a TV show, though it did make some notable mistakes. Murdock tells Hannibal to put the plane in a shallow dive to descend, which is not what airliners generally do. A "dive" means to lower the nose of the plane without reducing engine power; the resulting maneuver sheds altitude in exchange for higher airspeed. Airliners rarely dive when descending, and certainly <em>won't be losing airspeed while in a shallow dive</em>. Airliners generally just cut back on the engines to descend, and the reduced airspeed reduces lift and lets the plane drop (and often with spoilers partly deployed). The team also forget to deploy spoilers after touchdown, and despite being completely out of fuel Murdock tells them to reverse the thrusters, which is absolutely useless if they engine isn't producing any thrust. Also, although a Boeing 747-100/200 was used as the main plane, a few of the stock footage taxi scenes show engine nacelles from a 707.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSheepSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSheepSquadron">Black Sheep Squadron</a></em> used slightly-modified North American AT-6 trainer aircraft (different cockpit canopies) as Mitsubishi A6M "Zeros"/"Zekes". The AT-6 is a noticeably larger and somewhat differently-shaped aircraft than a Zero.
<ul><li> The T-6s were ones originally rebuilt to "impersonate" A6M2 "Zekes" for the 1970 movie <em>Tora! Tora! Tora!</em>. Those "Zekes" got around; they later showed up in the 1980 time-travel movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinalCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinalCountdown">The Final Countdown</a></em>, which had the nuclear carrier USS <em>Nimitz</em> warped back to the late afternoon of December 6, 1941, just west of Hawaii...
</li></ul></li><li> There's a rocket example in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>. Establishing model shots of the rocket are clearly based on the Russian Soyuz design, but the actual launch footage is of an American rocket. Presumably the producers were planning to use stock Soviet launch footage but either couldn't get it or thought it was of insufficient quality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheComicStripPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheComicStripPresents">The Comic Strip Presents</a></em> episode "Four Men in a Plane", our heroes take off for the middle east in a four-engined airliner, but when they land it's only got two engines. It's not the plane of the title, by the way  that is a single-engined light aircraft.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkSkies">Dark Skies</a></em> used a Redstone-Mercury to represent a Gemini launch despite Gemini stock footage being widely available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, the show seemed to use rocket stock footage in every other serial. This dropped off in later years, but didn't die off completely until nearly the end of the original run. There's also the Vogan "Skystriker" missile from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E5RevengeOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E5RevengeOfTheCybermen">"Revenge of the Cybermen"</a>, which is obviously a US Saturn V. And by "obviously" we mean it has "USA" painted on the side in big, easily legible letters.

They should have been Mk II or IIIs, which flew in the Battle of Britain.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E13TheBigBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E13TheBigBang">"The Big Bang"</a>, there is a scene showing a small video reel showing the journey of the Pandorica from Stonehenge to London. The video ends with the Blitz in 1941. The "German" bombers shown in the clip are actually American B-17 Flying Fortresses  in fact, the closest bomber has the American, <em>1943-45 vintage</em> USAAF roundel on the wing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em>, "Flight into Terror":
<ul><li> External shots show a BAe 146, but interior shots are of a wide-body aircraft.
</li><li> The priests find two parachutes and hold a 'Why Should I Win A Parachute' contest. Real passenger planes don't carry parachutes.
</li><li> There appears to be only one pilot onboard.
</li><li> When they're in the cockpit, the engine gauges are mentioned. The plane is a two-engined jet, but the pilot mentions 'engine three'.
</li><li> In the climax, Jack manages to open the cabin door in mid-air and jump out with the drink cart. Ted later climbs out the cabin door onto the fuselage. Both scenes are impossible due to the design of cabin doors. A more likely scenario is Jack struggling to open the door and being found by the priests.
</li></ul></li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero">The Greatest American Hero</a></em>, an episode called, <em>The Hand-Painted Thai</em> had scenes from the Vietnam War that were supposed to be taking place in 1970. In one of the scenes, you see an F-16 dropping bombs. The problem is that the F-16 never saw service in Vietnam. In fact, the F-16's first flight wasn't until a few years <em>after</em> this scene was supposed to take place.
</li><li> The military-legal show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> has many examples of this trope in practically every episode dealing with aircraft. There was a scene where some attack chopper was supposed to be firing machine guns. The noise was right, but the heli was really firing rockets from a pod. They were probably used in place of the guns because machine guns firing look quite boring in real life, as opposed to foot-long flaming "bullets". Oh, and here's a suggestion: if playing a <em>JAG</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame">Drinking Game</a>, drinking whenever a plane changes model in flight will get you drunk quick smart.
</li><li> Particularly jarring to anyone with half a brain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho">Jericho</a></em>, where the main character reports seeing a Tupolev "Bear" and some escorts, when the plane in question is clearly is a C-130 Hercules, the single longest-produced <em>American</em> military aircraft of all time.
</li><li> In the intro sequence of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movie</a> <em>A-to-Z The Gaia Memories of Destiny</em>, we see Katsumi Daido (soon-to-be Kamen Rider Eternal) hijacking a Foundation X helicopter in mid-air to steal their T2 Gaia Memories. The problem is, while the interior shots are of a normal civilian helicopter, which makes sense, the CGI exterior shots of the heli are of a freaking AH-64 Apache, which has no business being a transport vehicle for civilians. It's likely they just reused a 3D model they had lying around, since a similar CG Apache appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory">Origin Story</a> scene where Shotaro and Philip transform into Double for the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> falls into this fairly frequently. The most obvious case is in "The Mile High Job" which centers a round a plane flight. The establishing shot of LAX uses some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> which prominently displays a TWA airliner (TWA was bought out by American in 2001). On the flight, they have Parker giving the safety spiel (on just about any plane with an entertainment system, this is given by a video), and the plane itself seems to be a 777 with the wings of an A330.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMachineGunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMachineGunners">The Machine Gunners</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bizarrely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s TV adaptation changes the downed bomber from which the machine gun is stolen from a Heinkel He 111 to a Junkers Ju 52. Guess which one of these German aircraft <em>wasn't</em> in service as a bomber during 1941.
</li><li> The source novel explains that the tail section of the He 111 broke off and crashed into the woods after the rest of the aircraft crashed into the laundry. Since the dorsal gun on a He 111 is located relatively far forward on the aircraft there is no way the tail section of this aircraft could break off and still contain the gun position. While the Ju 52 used in the TV series was clearly incorrect for the time period, at least it had the gun position in the 'correct' spot for the plot to actually work.
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MagnumPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MagnumPI">Magnum, P.I.</a></em> two-parter had a "prototype attack helicopter" be hijacked <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agentified</a> T.C. and his Soviet handler</span>. The chopper is blatantly a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD_Helicopters_MD_500">McDonnell Douglas MD 500<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with rockets bolted on, i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">the same model of chopper that T.C. flies in his day job</a>. Not <em>quite</em> as bad as it could be, though, given the MD 500 is a civilian variant of the OH-6 Cayuse, which saw combat in Vietnam.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manifest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manifest">Manifest</a></em> has the main characters flying aboard a Boeing 737 Next Generation before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">vanishing from the face of the Earth for more than five years. When it lands, not only have five years inexplicably passed, the plane has also inexplicably become a much older 737 Classic.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mayday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mayday">Mayday</a></em> has a tendency to fall into this as well. One example is in the episode "Bomb on Board", which recycles the same clip for taking off and landing <em>with the thrust reversers deployed.</em> Another episode about the Tenerife disaster, which involved a collision between two 747s, Pan Am and KLM, introduces the KLM plane with a shot of it in flight... with winglets, identifying it as a 747-400, which would not be in production until 11 years after the disaster in 1977. In another episode, it is made clear that the people making the show believe that any twinjet in an American Airlines livery must be an A300.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> episode "Agent Afloat", an F/A-18 on USS <em>Seahawk</em> switches to an F-14 between shots. The F-14 had retired from USN service before the episode was made.
<ul><li> The first season episode "High Seas" features a US Navy SH-60 Seahawk quite clearly crewed by Australians.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Jetstream</em>, a documentary series on the training of Canadian fighter pilots, constantly has the announcer refer to the aircraft as the "F-18 Hornet". That was the original designation, but only Finland appears to use it. The US calls it the F/A-18 and the Canadian single-seater version is officially the CF-188A, but more usually called the CF-18A.
<ul><li> This is technically an error, but a forgivable one, as almost no one (even its pilots) bothers calling it the F/A-18 in colloquial speech. This is common with other aircraft that have complex or unpopular official tri-service designations. Generally, when referring to these aircraft, people will use the shorter (but technically incorrect) designation, or its common service name. For example, almost no one calls the A-10 the "Thunderbolt II". It is universally known as either the A-10, or the "hawg" or "warthog". The "F/A-18 Hornet" is more commonly known as "the bug" or "the plastic bug", etc.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPBellisario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPBellisario">Donald P. Bellisario</a> actually did do the research for the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em>. He went scouting for a Bell X-2, only to presumably be told that both the X-2s were destroyed in crashes so he'd have to make a replica. The full-scale fiberglass replica he had built is on display at Chino airport's Planes of Fame air museum, unfortunately quite worse for the weather since it's been stored outside for years, sans wings.
</li><li> The USS <em>Pike</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Salvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Salvation">Salvation</a></em> has a <a class="urllink" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9QaehQ3qRy5u-0o0QEspw9GWzCC__gClQWSYIe21z65F53L3MbsuSOmHL9A12K_uS8pVO84iL2rLrh5G56gBZ0PFrRm1_MxO9uNXh7-nIPThiSQsP5Pf3C0OJrVC0xRRTVrqwx2UEA=w919-h623-no">motley collection<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of aircraft, all of which do not belong on an American carrier. The only American craft are a US Coast Guard chopper and US Air Force F-22s and A-10s, the latter two of which can't land on carriers. Neither can the Eurofighter or non-navalized Russian MiG-29s. Also present is a French Army Caracal helicopter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SEALTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SEALTeam">SEAL Team</a></em> season 2's penultimate episode, Bravo Team is evacuated out of Pakistan by an Indian Air Force UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. Except the Indian Air Force doesn't use Blackhawks; their helicopters are almost all Russian or indigenous designs. American helicopters only began to enter the IAF's inventory in late 2019, and the first models to be delivered to India were the AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook.
</li><li> In the TV-movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan">The Six Million Dollar Man</a></em>, Steve Austin goes up in an HL-10 lifting body, but crashes in an M2-F2. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15amri');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15amri" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15amri');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is because the crash is <em>real</em>: pilot Bruce Peterson was very badly injured but survived, though he did not receive any bionic upgrades.</span>
<ul><li> In a later episode of the TV series, he pilots what's supposed to be the same aircraft yet again. This time, they show a Bell X-2 rocket plane. In the script, Steve Austin calls the plane the "X-PJ-1" (perhaps the script writer was wearing pajamas at the time).
</li><li> In another episode of the TV series, he's shown taking off in an F-4 Phantom II, flying around in a Northrop F-5, and landing in an F-104 Star Fighter. This scene was supposedly showing a single flight.
</li><li> In yet another episode, Steve identifies a fighter (an F-94) by the engine note alone (supposedly realistic, too).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> once featured a character taking a trip by private jet. When shown on the ground it was a Bae 125. The shot of it en route showed it had suddenly acquired a third engine and looked like a Falcon 50. It then got into trouble and plummeted Earthwards and turned into a Cessna before coming to rest as wreckage that looked like a Lear.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em> has off-screen F-14s scrambling out of Bagram in Afghanistan. The F-14 had been retired before the episode was made; even if they'd still been active, they would have been far more likely to have been scrambled from a nearby aircraft carrier than flying from a land base. It's doubtful any F-14s ever operated out of Bagram.
</li><li> In addition to lifting scenes from <em>Destination Moon</em>, the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTimeTunnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTimeTunnel">The Time Tunnel</a></em> used an Atlas rocket to represent the launch of a mission to Mars.

Most of them are modelled to resemble WWII propeller fighters but with jets instead of propellers, yet they supposedly can achieve speeds in excess of Mach 2. With leading edges a scale foot thick, real world aerodynamics would conspire to prevent this (though tough 40K materials in turn would conspire to prevent real life aerodynamics). Brute force can make anything fly, however it has rather greater trouble making anything <em>turn</em>: one doesnt put the engine in the front in supersonic fighters, because that moves the center of weight fore of the center of pressure, and would make the fighter so stable in supersonic flight that no amount of control force would allow it to maneuver. Let's not even get started on the Orks, Chaos and Dark Eldar aircraft, especially since the latter two belong in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">Artistic License  Physics</a> category by working on magic and very advanced technology, indistinguishable from magic as per Clarks Law of Science Fiction.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany">Battlefield: Bad Company</a> 2</em>, Haggard incorrectly identifies an Antonov An-124 that the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> uses as the Antonov An-225. This example may be intentional, as the information Haggard recites off the top of his head (the <em>Mriya</em> name's meaning, "Dream", and carry weight of 253 tons) are things that one would have to have done quite a bit of research on the plane to have it on-hand like that; it's also surprising, both to the rest of the squad and the audience, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Haggard of all people</a> to actually know that much about, well, anything (he responds to the squad's stunned silence with "What? I can know stuff!"). The fact that he's <em>wrong</em> makes it even funnier.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em> mission "Going Hunting" places the player in the shoes of a Radar Intercept Officer aboard an F/A-18 Super Hornet, but there are numerous mistakes. For starters, the pilot and co-pilot walk out onto the flight deck without putting on their helmets until just before climbing aboard their craft - real pilots have hearing protection on long before they get that close to an active plane, because even when idle jet engines are <em>loud</em>. The pilot also misuses "bogies" to refer to aircraft they already know are enemies, and one of the objectives halfway through the opening dogfight tells you to "Take out the remaining MiGs", when the enemies are flying the Sukhoi Su-35S. On the other hand, even real Naval aviators have applauded the actual takeoff for showing the real speed and exhilaration of using a steam catapult to launch off the carrier.
</li><li> The trailer for the updated version of the Gulf of Oman map for BF3 shows Marine variant F-35 fighter jets using their VTOL capability to act as impromptu attack helicopters. A real F-35 would be incapable of doing this without wasting a ton of fuel.
</li><li> The same game's F/A-18E Super Hornet incorrectly has Marine Corps markings. The US Marines have refused to use the Super Hornet, so as to not endanger their purchase of the F-35B.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a></em> has a few examples of playing this trope straight. In the first title, Georgia is depicted as having what looks like either a MiG-29 or a Su-27, neither of which are correct. Additionally, the depiction of the interior dimensions of the V-22 Osprey are noticeably generous to anyone who has actually stepped foot in one. Large computer bank on each wall with room to move comfortably in between? Not likely...
</li><li> Mostly averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> series, though there are occasional oddities  in the real world, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareVehicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareVehicles">Su-47 Berkut</a> is a tech demo, and only one exists. In the games, multiple Su-47s are flown in battle by the various sides, all the way up to whole squadrons using the model, like Gault in <em>The Belkan War</em>. Also subverted on occasion, however; for example, both the X-02 Wyvern and the ADF-01 Falken superfighters, which look implausibly cool, have been modeled in the realistic flight sim X-Plane and successfully proven to be airworthy under modern flight knowledge limitations. This far from stops fanboys of Glorious Mother Russia insisting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> comments that no pesky American jet should be able to keep up with their beloved MiGs and Sukhois, never mind score a gunkill.
<ul><li> Similarly, when they came out, multiple titles feature more Lockheed-Martin F-22 fighters serving in <em>multiple</em> air forces then were operational in the <em>actual</em> world, and with the decision of military spending in the United States, will probably ever be operational.
</li><li> F-117s and tech demos like the X-29 and F-15 S/MTD are equipped with machine guns, which they didn't have in real life (and which the S/MTD <em>couldn't</em> have, since the right canard is right in the path of a regular Eagle's gun); some later games in the series do at least put the guns in gunpods under the wings or fuselage for craft that didn't/couldn't have an internal gun. The F-117 is also equipped with air-to-air missiles; the real thing was a dedicated attacker, despite the F-number designation,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17fb10');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17fb10" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17fb10');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which was mostly for propaganda purposes, since even before it was officially unveiled the "stealth fighter" had already reached mythical status among the civilian public</span> and only had room for two bombs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies</a></em> added the Fox and other brevity codes for launching weapons, but most air-to-air special weapons are called with "Fox One", the term for semi-active radar-guided weapons, despite them being modeled after and programmed to act like <em>active</em> radar-guided weapons that would be called with "Fox Three". <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5</a></em> fixed this (applying "Fox One" solely to the weapon identified as a semi-active weapon and using "Fox Three" for the others), but still has the issue of air-to-ground missiles using Fox codes instead of proper terms like "Bruiser" for the LASM; this too was fixed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">Zero</a></em>.
</li><li> The most egregious - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">albeit deliberate</a> - departure from reality is the missile armament on the planes - first, the planes can carry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">a ludicrous number of missiles</a> (upwards of fifty on the low-end fighters early in the series, and up to more than a <em>hundred</em> in more modern games; real missile armaments, even on the most heavily laden of proposed fighters, such as the F-15X, max out at 22, and few planes currently in service can carry more than 12), and second, the standard heat-seeking missiles are able to lock on to, and are equally effective against, both fast-moving fighters as well as hardened bunkers and buildings. A lot of the special weapons are also more viable than in reality; while you still can't lock onto an air target with a dedicated air-to-ground weapon, ground and sea targets are given no such distinction, so there's nothing stopping you from destroying a fortified bunker with a Harpoon that shouldn't work as well as it does over land (the only difference between the "LAGM" and "LASM" is that one dives upon reaching the target and has a wider blast radius, while the other dives upon firing and focuses its full power on the target).
</li><li> The in-game descriptions for the jets occasionally fall into this; for example, <em>Shattered Skies</em> refers to a number of the useable planes as having "forward-swept" wings  the above-mentioned Su-47 and X-02 are the only jets in the game that feature them. Apparently they mistook (or mistranslated) canards as "forward-swept wings", since a lot of the planes described as forward-swept designs <em>do</em> have canards.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18bh9t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18bh9t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18bh9t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It wouldn't be the only such mistake in the game - turning ability in the game also seems to have been mistaken as "able to roll really well", where high-end planes like the Eurofighter and Su-37 can do a complete barrel roll in half a second but can only actually change pitch as well as the F-4E you start the game with.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat2">Ace Combat 2</a></em>, an F-22's thrust vectoring is shown off at one point in the intro cinematic, but its engines point in different directions during a roll, which the real F-22's engines can't actually do (their thrust-vectoring is two dimensional, and only assists with pitch). There's also the issue of it and its Su-35 wingmate taking off from an aircraft carrier when neither of them are carrier-capable.
</li><li> Earlier games in the series utilized a Flanker that was referred to as the original Su-27 but was very clearly not one, having the canards of upgraded models like the Su-33 and original Su-35. Likewise for other planes that were still in development at the time of the games' releases; for instance, the F-22 was not actually an F-22 until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</a></em>, every prior game (released before the production F-22 was finalized) using the YF-22 prototype, of which only two existed, and the Su-47 in <em>04</em> being noticeably different from the real thing due to a lack of proper sources to model it after, being more of a hybrid between the real Su-47 and the fictional Su-43 from <em>Electrosphere</em>.
</li><li> The main reason that the game can give a seemingly limitless supply of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototypes</a> and Tech Demonstrators to enemy and friendly fighter squadrons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">is because it takes place in an alternate universe</a> that goes through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">at least two large-scale wars per decade</a> (because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo">nuclear proliferation doesn't exist</a> to make such aggression the quickest way to turn the game into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> clone), where the outcome of these wars very often hinges on the prowess of air support (Erusea in <em>04</em> is able to take over almost the entirety of Usea before the game starts simply by having an extremely effective anti-air defense system that reaches over most of the continent) and the possibilities of such aircraft entering active service with any military are as such perfectly reasonable. Although this then raises the question of why an alternate Earth with different geography and politics has managed to produce the same planes, credited to the same companies, as our world — and that's <em>before</em> you get into the issue of companies selling or licensing their designs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">to both sides of a conflict</a> (granted, the latter fact actually becomes a plot point in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">the fifth game</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatInfinity">Ace Combat Infinity</a></em>, set in the real world, has an alternate justification for why there are so many rare or obsolete planes still flying in 2019 - following the Ulysses asteroid impact and most governments' reducing military spending to focus on rebuilding, a company called Wernher and Noah Enterprises have taken up production of military craft, streamlining the process via "Advanced Automated Aviation Plants" to the point that planes can be built quickly, cheaply, and efficiently so long as blueprints for it exist. This makes mercenary squadrons like the players are in a very lucrative business (what with a surplus of planes but a shortage of pilots to fly them), but also allows terrorist groups access to vast amounts of military hardware. That said, it still stretches plausibility when you realize that both planes which didn't exist prior to the Ulysses impact in 1999, such as the Su-35S (first flight in 2008), the T-50 (2010), and the ATD-X (2016) and even fictional designs from the Strangereal universe, up to and including the R-101 Delphinus and X-49 Night Raven from <em>Electrosphere</em> (set in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">2040</a></em>, for context) are available with little explanation, the first handful handwaved as coming from an undefined "hostile country" before the descriptions for later ones straight-up forgot this game is set in an alternate universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatJointAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatJointAssault">Ace Combat: Joint Assault</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat7SkiesUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat7SkiesUnknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a></em> pay particular attention to carrier compatibility. For one mission, if the plane you select has an extant naval variant (or for the former game, select either one of the 2 prop fighters), you start with a carrier launch; if it doesn't, you perform a mid-air refuelling instead. Similarly, when taking off from a beached carrier in the latter game, compatible aircraft will use the slingshot; incompatible ones start much further back on the flight deck and will need pretty much the whole length to get airborne.
</li><li> Ever since its first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</a></em>, the Su-33 Flanker-D has been depicted with a catapult connecting bar that isn't present on the real plane so that players can use it on missions that are restricted to carrier aircraft (which consistently use US CATOBAR carriers; the Su-33 is carrier-capable, but Russian carriers don't use a catapult launch system).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em> falls into this trap by showing F-15Cs in "The Gulag" mission but later referring to the Navy as bombing the gulag. The Navy uses F/A-18s and eventually will use F-35s for combat missions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1955gd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1955gd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1955gd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, this mission is clearly influenced by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock">The Rock</a></em>, and yet it makes the exact opposite error that movie does.</span> Apparently the developers didn't want to bother modeling another aircraft. It's also rather sad considering <em>Call of Duty 4</em> correctly showed the Marines getting their air support from SuperCobras and Harriers - except in multiplayer, where again the F-15 carries out both their airstrikes and those of the SAS. A lesser goof is that the launching of AGM-88 HARMs, which no F-15 variant is compatible with, is announced with a call of "Fox Three", which is the brevity code for <em>air-to-air, active radar-guided</em> missiles. An anti-radiation air-to-ground missile would be fired with a call of "Magnum".
</li><li> <em>Call of Duty 4</em> also features Mi-24 Hind attack helicopters in Chernobyl's vehicle graveyards. No such aircraft are present in the real graveyards.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20xawi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20xawi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20xawi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is most likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a>: Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, which also erroneously features Hinds in the vehicle graveyards.</span> Zakhaev's forces also use Mi-28N Havocs for air cover in the Chernobyl missions, at best a couple months before the prototype for that version even had its first flight. Especially odd is that, in the rest of the game, where the Mi-28N being ubiquitous would have been temporally possible, the Ultranationalists are the only non-playable faction that <em>doesn't</em> use them.
</li><li> In a rather minor example, the loading screen for the famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a>" mission features a wireframe model of the AC-130H "Spectre" (easily identified by two M61 Vulcan cannons), but the info given and what the player actually uses in the mission is a single 25mm GAU-12, indicating it's actually an AC-130U "Spooky". To go meta, most third-party sources state that the plane used is the Spectre based on the fifteen-second wireframe cutscene rather than the actual gameplay.
</li><li> <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> had a chronic case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics">Easy Logistics</a>, with magical transatlantic Havocs-apparently-carrying-BMPs probably the biggest example.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyWorldAtWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyWorldAtWar">World at War</a></em> gets this wrong on occasion. The worst example would be from the beginning of the Soviet campaign, where "German bombers" are seen flying over Stalingrad in a Blitz-style air-raid. Quite apart from the fact that the Germans did not use saturation bombing on Stalingrad at that point in the battle (what with their own men inside the city and everything), the planes featured are <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_200#Design_and_development">Focke-Wulf Fw 200s,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which were primarily naval reconnaissance and patrol aircraft, and had small bomb bays. Fw 200s <em>were</em> deployed to Stalingrad, but only as transport aircraft making up part of Goering's idiotic "air bridge". They were likely used in the game because they had four engines, and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">looked more intimidating</a> than the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_Do_17">Dornier Do 17s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_111">Heinkel He 111s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that would actually have been used.

<ul><li> The PBY Catalina the player mans the guns of in "Black Cats" has both Oerlikon 20mm cannons and Browning M1919 machine guns mounted on the bow. The cannons were often reported as a field modification to Catalinas in the Pacific, but they'd have to remove the machine guns to make the room for them - they weren't meant as an additional set of guns to support the M1919s but rather as straight-up replacements with better range and power. Additionally, the player's Catalina is severely undermanned - the real things had a crew of ten (pilot, copilot, flight engineer, navigator, radio and radar operators, and four gunners), but the player's crew is at half that (pilot and copilot alongside only two gunners, forcing the player character to waste time clambering between individual guns, and <em>one</em> guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrewOfOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrewOfOne">handling everything else</a>).

The actual U-2s were designed specifically to fly so high that then-existing anti-aircraft weaponry couldn't reach them. There is no in-game justification for why they would be flying so low, it's pure game balance. It also features both NPC and player-controlled Hind gunships in Vietnam in 1968, a full year and a half before its first flight and four years before it entered military service, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">but that's one of the lesser anachronisms in this game.</a> A less noticeable but even more anachronistic goof is that the in-game Hind also has a missile warning system for when enemies acquire a lock with a missile launcher, and an automated countermeasure system to redirect the first such missile fired at it; the real craft didn't have such systems until they started losing a handful of Hinds to Mujahideen fighters utilizing Stinger missiles partway through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan">Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan</a> almost two decades later.
</li><li> <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>'s second mission starts with a transmission from F-22 pilots preparing for a bombing run, but the wireframe models and information on the screen, along with the planes that actually show up in the mission, are all once again F-15s. On top of that, the loadout shown for them tries to claim that an external fuel tank is a JDAM, and for the actual air strike they launch "JDAM Missiles", which A) don't exist (JDAMs are a conversion kit for unguided bombs), and B) are actually AIM-120 Sparrows, a dedicated air-to-air weapon.

</li><li> <em>F-19 Stealth Fighter</em> was a combat flight simulator produced by Microprose in 1986. Its fictional plane used the same general appearance as the Testor Corporation's model kit, and was similar in capability to the F-19 featured in Tom Clancy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising">Red Storm Rising</a> a few years earlier. Ironically the game was released on the same day that the U.S. military admited the existence of the F-117, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> "stealth fighter", which turned out to be quite a different bird. The 1991 sequel/remake added the real F-117, with real-world capability to match (flying the F-117 made for an easy mission, while flying the less-stealthy but air-to-air combat-capable F-19 made for a more exciting one).
</li><li> A carrier appears at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> with F-22s and Apache helicopters shown sitting on the flight deck. The problem being that the Navy uses neither of these. The Air Force uses F-22s (there is no naval [read: carrier landing] variant, the Navy's version of the Advanced Tactical Fighter program being cancelled less than a year after development began on the finalized F-22) and the Apache is only used by the Army. The Navy also doesn't give up its flight deck space to the other services when they have their own aircraft to use. If the game is really set a few years in the future, then the deck could be covered in the similar-looking and planned-to-be-ubiquitous F-35, and the Apaches could be handwaved as the Marines <em>finally</em> replacing the aging Super Cobra (rather than just upgrading it), but it probably isn't.
<ul><li> They also don't use Blackhawks, so the ubiquitous transports should be upgraded Hueys, or if it's really the future, V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors. There are also, incidentally, no Bradley IFVs in the Marine inventory. If the developers had just name-swapped the Marines in dialogue with the Army, almost everything except the carrier and its F-22s would work fine.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">averted thoroughly</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> combat flight simulator series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IL2Sturmovik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IL2Sturmovik">IL-2 Sturmovik</a></em>.

In the studio's next game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarThunder">War Thunder</a></em>, putting a non-afterburning engine's throttle past 100%, and actually firing the afterburners on the jet engines that <em>do</em> have them, are both referred to more properly as War Emergency Power, or WEP for short.
<ul><li> While a "Jug" certainly couldn't have a "reheat", the afterburner was actually around back then. The Italian Caproni-Campini CC1 fighter prototype of 1940 used a radial engine to run a ducted fan (much like many modern radio-control flying models), and it did have a "thrust augmentator", which squirted aviation-grade gasoline into the duct behind the fans and ignited it. In other words, an afterburner. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early jet technology could get a little strange</a>, by modern standards.
</li></ul></li><li> DiD's 80s flight sim F-29 Retaliator has some rather odd quirks; for a start, the poster plane is actually the F-22, the game having been mis-announced by Ocean's notoriously fearsome CEO and nobody wanting to correct him (mirroring the urban legend about the SR-71's name). The YF-22 wouldn't fly until a year after the game came out, so the aircraft is based on concept art that closely resembles the much later MiG 1.44 prototype. But that's not even the start of the silliness.
<ul><li> You are still in full control of your plane after ejecting from it. You can even kill yourself by bringing the plane around and crashing it into the descending pilot sprite.
</li><li> Landing gear raises instantly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">It's possible to kill yourself the second a mission starts by pressing G</a> (yes, a six foot drop is a fatal crash; apparently your plane is made from blasting caps and dynamite); have fun, since you <em>want</em> to press F and B to extend flaps and disengage the parking brake.
</li><li> There is actually an F-29 in the game. It's the X-29 research aircraft magically turned into a fighter without changing anything about it — even the paint scheme on the intro screen. The player is offered the choice between the not-F-22 and the F-29 at the start of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> Volgin has a great number of Mi-24 Hind helicopters under his command, but the game takes place in 1964, six years before the helicopter went into production and even the first prototype was still very early in development. To give the designers some credit, the helicopters are the early Hind-A version with the polygonal canopy, instead of the iconic bubble canopy of the Hind-D and later models, making it an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareVehicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareVehicles">Rare Helicopters</a>. It's also worth noting that the game explains that Volgin has priority access to what was at the time the cutting edge of Soviet equipment, and in a Codec conversation you find out that this is the first time anyone from the West has encountered the design, with Snake being the one who initially suggests the "Hind" callsign based on the fact that it looks to be a sleeker derivative of the Mi-8 Hip (although that potentially opens another can of worms when you consider the Mi-8 wasn't actually adopted by the Soviet military until '67).
<ul><li> The game's designers deserve quite a bit of credit, as most of the 'wacky designs' for vehicles in the game (save the Shagohod, which is classically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> in traditional Metal Gear fashion) are drawn from rare but existing real life prototypes and models, such as the M21 insertion drone used by Naked Snake at the start of Operation Snake Eater and the Bartini Beriev WIG which appears in the ending scenes. Even the science-fiction-style hovering platforms used by patrols in some areas are based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiller_VZ-1_Pawnee">real<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_X-Jet">prototypes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, proving once again that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted by <em>X-Plane</em>. While flight sims are generally pretty good at getting it right <em>X-Plane</em>'s attention to detail and real-world flight physics is so incredibly accurate it can be used, along with the right hardware, for getting one's FAA certification. That's right, they've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">shown so much work</a> that many countries' aviation regulators agree it's just like flying a real airplane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HAWX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HAWX">H.A.W.X.</a></em> starts out with the retirement flight of the eponymous Air Force squadron - flying Navy F/A-18C Hornets. You don't even get a choice of what plane to fly for the mission when replaying it later.
<ul><li> The first game also prevented planes from slowing down to below 1000 km/h outside of Assistance OFF mode. Even though this could have exceeded the never-exceed velocity of some slower planes. Even includes all planes breaking the sound barrier, which in real life could have shattered some of them. The second game fixes that, allowing the plane to stall even in Assistance ON mode, though the flight computer still makes it difficult to do so.
</li><li> When in Assistance OFF mode, the player is able to stall the plane out. It indeed does start plummeting near-immediately, but a stall is more likely to happen when the player is flying extremely slowly while turning a lot. Where it falls into this trope is that, if the player decides to stay in that state for the hell of it by keeping the plane level with the ground and holding the airbrakes, their plane will in most cases start to <em>fly backwards</em>. This was fixed in the sequel.
</li><li> Like <em>Ace Combat</em>, the planes are all given ludicrous amounts of missiles (this time the absolute minimum is about 88, flying a "Low Payload" craft on the highest difficulty which cuts missile counts) that can target both fast-movers and stationary ground installations. The second game still gives planes at least three-fourths of a full ton worth of missiles, but the default ones are now explicitly-labeled "Heat-Seeking Missiles" that can only target other aircraft.
</li><li> In a reversal of the original point, at one point the player character defects from the Artemis PMC back to the US military. He does so while defending a naval group, who suggests clearing a space on their aircraft carrier for them to land, even though it's possible (and likely, given the game's suggested plane for the mission) that the player is <em>not</em> flying a jet capable of landing on a carrier.
</li><li> Every jet in the game with more than one variant uses the exact same model for each one, even when later variants add or remove extra seating, switch out the engines, or the like. The sole major exceptions are the F/A-18E Super Hornet, which has the proper wider fuselage than the other Hornet variants,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note216dkx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note216dkx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note216dkx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">appropriate, since the real Super Hornet has been described as closer to a new plane advertised as a variant for the purposes of not inviting budget scrutiny</span> and the F-15 ACTIVE, which lengthens the fuselage to fit a second seat in the cockpit, but even that omits the thrust-vectoring engines the real thing has - and the game also fails to make the same modification for the F-15E that the ACTIVE was based on. The only other exceptions are when a variant of a plane adds canards, but that's the only difference, and if you look at the textures, you'll note that for most craft with canards like the Flanker family, they're lazy enough about it that canards are textured even on variants that don't have them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DigitalCombatSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DigitalCombatSimulator">Digital Combat Simulator</a></em> largely averts this thanks to its very realistic cockpit and flight simulation, but the trope does pop up from time to time - some planes are modeled in a wonky way that allows them to accelerate far faster than they realistically could in a given situation, while others are able to maintain lift even when their pushed beyond what would realistically be possible given their energy-management profile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aerobiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aerobiz">Aerobiz</a></em>: Though most aircraft have historically accurate phase-in and discontinuation dates, they don't feature accurate seating capacities or operational ranges. This is further exaggerated by the fact that the game does not allow airlines to make any alterations to the seating capacities or cabin configurations.

The problem arises because in a game that takes almost entirely in the United States,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22ckm3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22ckm3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22ckm3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">barring the first of the Decepticon campaign which takes in an American military base in Qatar, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel">Bonus Level</a> for both that takes place on Cybertron</span> their vehicle mode is a <em>Russian</em> MiG-29. Granted, some private companies in the States do have MiG-29s that are used as targets for training exercises, but particularly with the film's sub-plot about the US thinking the Qatar attack was done by a foreign power with Russia, North Korea, China, and later Iran in a throwaway line being named-dropped. Three guesses which fighter jet all four of those nations happen to use. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Yeah</a>.
<ul><li> The concept artist (at least for the Transformers) of the first two games reveals he was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">barred from modeling an American fighter jet for the game</a> and he only went with the MiG-29 because if you squint it kinda looks an F-15.
</li><li> The licensed game for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em> also has this issue. While the Autobot Breakaway having the F-35 Lightning II as a vehicle can be excused as it did have its first flight in 2006 and he is the only F-35 to appear in the game, and the Navy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">properly</a> using the F/A-18 Hornet in the carrier fleet level, the helicopters in the game are handled with the same attention to detail. Specifically, NEST uses the RAH-66 Comanche as an attack and transport helicopter. In reality, the Comanche was canceled in 2004 and, despite it having respectable firepower, was primarily meant to serve as a target spotter for the Apache. It also is incapable of carrying any passengers, let alone the three that are packed into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownCar">same helicopter in one mission</a>. Also, any points for the Hornets can be taken away as the same level has CH-53 Super Stallions on their littoral combat ships. The Super Stallion is a Marine helicopter.

</li><li> <em>F/A-18 Hornet</em> had you fighting Soviet MiG-27s and Su-27s in the Persian Gulf. The only time MiGs were used by Iraq was during the 1985 Iran-Iraq War; during the Gulf War, they had Su-25s, but not -27s. On the US side, the F-16 Fighting Falcon featured in later editions is sometimes seen taking off from or landing on an aircraft carrier, which it is incapable of in real life (the Navy only <em>very</em> briefly considered adopting a navalized variant of the F-16, the Vought Model 1600,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note239r9f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note239r9f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note239r9f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the US Navy does operate a handful of F-16s, but only in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsUnderstudies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsUnderstudies">adversary squadrons</a>, and they're emphatically <em>not</em> carrier-capable.</span> before settling on the Northrop YF-17 instead).
</li><li> One of the playable planes in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfWar">Skies Of War</a></em> is a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_C-47_Skytrain">C-47 Skytrain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is used as a medium bomber, of all things, with a missile mount and two fixed forward facing gun positions on each wing in addition to the bomb bays. While versatile and no doubt capable of such a theoretical modification, the C-47 was a cargo and paratrooper plane, with a close support variant, the AC-47 "Spooky", mounting three gun positions along the port side. This is strange, as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_B-25_Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> could have easily taken its place as the medium twin engined bomber.
</li><li> The American fighters attacking the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Walker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Walker">Walker</a></em> in the Berlin level are not only able to drop an enormous bomb payload, far too large for this type of plane, but even several paratroopers in one flight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The standard Allied bomber aircraft is identified by name and icon as the AV-8 Harrier, and they appear as such in cutscenes such as a mid-mission one for the second Allied mission or the introduction to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, but the actual voxel art used in gameplay more resembles the A-6E Intruder, which cannot take off and land vertically as the in-game craft does; earlier in development the craft was identified as an Intruder, with the name and icon change apparently happening midway through to fit better with it acting as a VTOL aircraft.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24abt5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24abt5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24abt5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Interestingly, the Traditional Chinese translation of the game does more or less properly call the Harrier the "Intruder" instead.</span> The Aircraft Carrier also utilizes small, apparently-unmanned aircraft referred to as "Hornets", presumably meant to be the real F/A-18 Hornet despite it also being incapable of VTOL, and not even existing in a non-prototype in the game's time frame of 1972 (then again, this is a game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">laser technology</a> is utilized as a direct method of attacking hostiles in combat, so maybe it was developed earlier here).
</li><li> The introduction to <em>Yuri's Revenge</em> is even worse. As above the CGI models are proper Harriers, but the cockpit view showcased on a few occasions is wildly inaccurate, depicting a control panel with a pair of gauges and two or three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">Big Red Buttons</a>, rather than the array of <em>several</em> gauges and buttons that even the earliest Harrier variants had - to say nothing of the actual head-up display having apparently gone AWOL (unless we're meant to assume the in-game version has a helmet-mounted display system like the modern F-35). Then the first of the Harriers to get shot down by Yuri's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">gatling-based</a> defenses has one wing torn off by a neat line of bullets cutting through it, but it rolls away from the missing wing <em>and</em> somehow still manages to home in directly onto another still-functioning Harrier to crash into it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEyeWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEyeWii">GoldenEye Wii</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Russian Federation does not use the Ch-53 (slightly dressed up and called the "Ludmila T1" here), as in Dam, or the AH-6, as in Tank. Granted, the former case is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">noted by Bond</a>, even if it's more because he can somehow tell at a glance that it looks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">EMP-hardened</a>, and so one of the objectives of the level is to take pictures of it so MI6 can help figure out <em>why</em> it's there. Also, much like the Eurocopter Tiger from the original movie it's taking the place of, the Ch-53 does not have an ejection system and cannot lock missiles onto itself (it doesn't even <em>have</em> missiles).
</li><li> Also, the SAM launchers in Airfield are the American MIM-23 Hawk, rather than an actual Russian system like the SA-19/SA-22. <em>Reloaded</em> at least adds ZU-23-2 guns that Russia actually does use, but because they weren't there in the Wii version nobody is able to actually use them here.
</li><li> Sky Briggs notes in Dubai that the pilots for the copter on display there used to fly Cobras for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Blackwater</a>. The AH-1 isn't in use with military contractors. The Blackhawk would probably be a better fit, since there is a civil variant.

Aside from only having a pilot with no co-pilot or auto-pilot, causing the plane to begin to plunge to the ground whenever he steps away from the controls, it also features the ability of the crew to climb <em>out on the wing</em> to fix damaged engines - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">which did indeed happen once</a>, in an incident that earned <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Cyril_Jackson">the sergeant involved<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a Victoria Cross and a whole forest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>'s Sea Duck is a cargo plane that can outperform fighter jets. This is justified in the pilot arc, where Kit points out that Baloo has extensively customized the plane, but never again are Baloo's special modifications even mentioned. Indeed, one of those modifications, the Overdrive, burns out at the climax of the pilot film and is never replaced. Although the Sea Duck's performance is implausible for a large, twin-engined cargo seaplane, there are no actual fighter jets in the series to out-perform  the setting for the series seems to be the late 1930s, where jet engine technology is barely nascent. Baloo actually pilots the first jet engine known in the series' universe. Yes, jet <em>engine</em>  it wasn't attached to an aircraft yet. The Sea Duck is also insanely hardy — Baloo is well-known for the many times he's flown <em>into the sea</em>, and had to be fished out. Any non-gliding wings-level calm-sea alighting will usually result in the utter destruction of any airplane. Also on Baloo's bragging list is flying underwater, landing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection">inside a volcano</a></em>, taking off backwards, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">landing on a nightmarishly impossible roller-coaster-like runway that makes even him nervous</a>.
<ul><li> The <em>Sea Duck</em> itself appears to be a Fairchild C-82 Packet transport (first flew 1944) combined with a Grumman HU-16 Albatross flying boat/amphibian (first flew 1949), with the livery of a Canadair CL-215 waterbomber (first flew 1967).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, we have Quagmire, an airline pilot. In the episode "Airport '07", Peter somehow manages to drive onto an airport ramp post-9/11, ride up to an airplane on the tarmac, detach the fuel hose from said plane, and somehow stick it in his truck. Must be a one-size-fits-all hose. And security must be pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">lax</a>. And that truck must be a diesel truck to be able to run on Jet A. And nobody was manning the refueling truck until after Peter had used it to fuel his truck and leave. The plane later crashes after running out of fuel, and Quagmire, its pilot, loses his job, as if it's his fault that the refueling crew failed to keep an eye on their truck. He confronts Peter, admonishing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">No Peter, it's perfectly normal to siphon jet fuel from an active runway with the intention of flying a pickup truck!</a>".
<ul><li> Also falls into this due to the "active runway" comment - an active runway is the runway currently in use. Runways aren't all in use at once, but are opened or closed on the basis of wind direction. The plane in the episode sounds like it was on a taxiway instead of a runway, as being on the runway itself is only allowed if you're about to take off, are landing, or quickly crossing it. Of course, Quagmire could have just been exaggerating when he said active runway. Or the writers thought "active runway" meant that the airport was in use, not out of commission, and not the runway itself.
</li><li> "Halloween on Spooner Street" has a Japanese Zero in an American airplane graveyard, which is not only gassed up and still fully-functional, but also has room to fit two extra people (possibly three, given Peter's girth) behind the pilot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It should be noted, however, that this situation was intentionally set up by Quagmire to pay Peter and Joe back for pranks they pulled on him earlier in the episode.</span>
</li><li> The 2012 Christmas episode opened with a fake commercial making fun of Northwest Airlines, 4 years after Northwest ceased to exist after merging with Delta. Might overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">We're Still Relevant, Dammit!</a>.
</li><li> "The Road To Germany" commits a significant history flub by showing Avro Lancaster bombers in RAF service in 1939. The Lancaster did not fly until 1941 and was not introduced into squadron service until the following year. The Short Stirling or the Avro Manchester (which was developed into the Lancaster, but had only two engines) would have been more appropriate if they wanted a large British bomber.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> often falls into this trope such as showing a DC-9 and then having it be a twin aisle on the inside, but an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example comes in the episode "Fatbeard". Cartman plans to go to Somalia to become a pirate by flying Southwest to Miami, and the Dubai Air to Cairo. Problem is, Southwest doesn't serve Miami, and there is no such airline as "Dubai Air." The closest would be Emirates, who doesn't have a hub in Cairo, but rather Dubai...go figure. Also, no airline even flies Miami-Cairo. Based on a standard great circle routing, Miami is actually a very inconvenient connecting point for flights from the Middle East, since "up and over" towards the north pole is more direct.
<ul><li> Once they get to the airport it continues. After talking about Southwest earlier, they check-in at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX">Alpha</a> counter before showing a Southwest-painted 757 (a plane Southwest does not fly) with 5 across seating. A 757 (as well as a 737, which Southwest <em>does</em> fly) would have 6 across.
</li></ul></li><li> Toward the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockADoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockADoodle">Rock-A-Doodle</a></em>, the rodent character refers to a large, twin-rotor helicopter the main characters apparently stole as a Sikorsky, but in real life, Sikorsky never manufactured any twin-rotor helicopters at all. If anything, the depicted helicopter bears more of a resemblance to Boeing's Chinook with comically-oversized engines and the side door moved back about halfway along the fuselage.
</li><li> The DVD-exclusive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PixarShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PixarShorts">Cars Toon</a></em> "Moon Mater" mostly averts this where the space shuttle Captain Roger actually flies into space vertically like a real space shuttle, but plays this straight at the end of the short where he actually takes off on a runway.
</li><li> Averted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> that takes place on a Zeppelin-like vehicle. Archer spends the entire episode convinced that the thing will go up in flames at the drop of a hat, even though everyone keeps telling him that it's using inert helium to float, instead of combustible hydrogen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> has Starscream, who is identified in dialogue as being a Harrier but at no point uses the trademark VTOL capabilities (even though as an alien he could hover in place as long as he wanted without having to worry about wasting fuel). He also has more in common with the Russian Su-47, and the fact Harrier production ended in 2003 means it is unlikely a Harrier resembling Starscream will ever be built.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, meanwhile, has Agent Fowler, who is frequently seen flying around in a fighter jet in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">business suit</a> instead of the proper pilot's uniform which is necessary to protect the wearer from the g-forces and ensure they always have a healthy supply of oxygen. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">does get explained in season 2</a> where it turns out the fighter jet was modified by Ratchet so he could fly without one, but this still doesn't explain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">where he was storing</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">DINGUS</a> in Convoy.
<ul><li> Even ignoring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Airachnid</a> getting an alt mode of an RAH-66 Comanche, which as mentioned above was cancelled with only two being built well over a decade before the show came out, she somehow gets it from scanning Fowler's helicopter - which, like every other helicopter in the show, is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryHelicopterIsAHuey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryHelicopterIsAHuey">a Huey</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the episode of the French animated series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> "Guided Missile", one of the protagonists wins a ride in the back seat of a jet fighter during a live-fire weapons demo in a contest. While this alone is improbable, it become even more cringe-worthy when the plane is revealed to be an F-18, a distinctly American craft which France has never used (and, if they can help it, likely never will; an indigenous Dassalt Mirage or Rafale would have made more sense). And then the show's villain takes command of it to try and kill the rest of the protagonists... with the plane's Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.
</li><li> Somewhat averted in the Disney World War II animated film <em>Victory through Airpower</em>; the fictitious heavy bombers taking off from Alaska to bomb Japan bear curious resemblance to real life B-36 Peacemakers, though they were in reality not produced until after the war. Of course, Alexander Severskey, who was the narrator for the film, was himself a major aviation pioneer and is said to have insisted on technical accuracy for even the fictitious planes depicted in the film.
</li><li> Klunk's plane inventions on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a></em> defy all aeronautical logic.
</li><li> Same with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JayJayTheJetPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JayJayTheJetPlane">Jay Jay the Jet Plane</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">although the show is aimed at preschoolers who don't know a single thing about aeronautical logic</a>.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, Jr., Jr." sketch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> has one scene in which the protagonists fly F-14 jets, but Gandalf refers to them as F-16s, which isn't even getting into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">fighter jets in Middle-Earth in the first place</a>. Justified in that the whole sketch is supposed to be a sneak peek at the movie adaptation of a half-finished <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> sequel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">as completed by Tolkien's six-year-old grandson</a>, a six-year-old being exactly the sort of person who would assume "F-16" is shorthand for "awesome jet that does anything"... not to mention be responsible for the <em>rest</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">the weirdness in that sketch</a>.
</li><li> The 1952 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> cartoon "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HareLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HareLift">Hare Lift</a>" is full of this, with a giant plane doing all sorts of impossible things. All quite intentional, in service of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.
<ul><li> The earlier 1943 cartoon "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FallingHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FallingHare">Falling Hare</a>" has a few of these as well, though like the above most of these are intentional for comedy, most notably the final gag where the plane's nosedive into an inevitable crash-landing comes to a sudden halt just feet away from impact, in complete defiance of gravity, because it ran out of fuel. On the other hand, there is the actual goof of an American airfield utilizing what appears to be a Heinkel He-111.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In 2011, China released a video of one of its pilots shooting down another aircraft during training. Almost immediately it was noticed that the footage of the exercise <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8291729/China-red-faced-after-footage-of-new-fighter-was-from-Top-Gun.html">was pretty much identical to a scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em>.
</li><li> It's an inaccuracy to call all Soviet/Russian aircraft MiGs (this is roughly equivalent to calling all US aircraft Boeings). There are plenty of non-Mikoyan aircraft in Russian service  such as Sukhoi's Su-27 "Flanker". Justified, most of the Russian fighters that got a lot of publicity during the Cold War were Mikoyan aircraft, and American ace pilots and the aircraft they flew who scored many kills against Cold War opponents were called "MiG Killers". Sukhoi did not come into much prominence until they introduced the Flanker, which by the time it became publicly seen and well known, the Cold War was over (the only Sukhois involved in live combat during the Cold War, at least as reported by the US, were the Su-22s shot down in the 1981 Gulf of Sidra incident).
<ul><li> For much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> Sukhoi was seen as an interceptor and ground attack house, producing, for example, the Su-15 aircraft that gained notoriety after being used to intercept Korean Air 007 flight, and the armored fire support workhorse of the Su-25. They also dabbled in bombers, but the influence of Tupolevs was unsurmountable, so they never managed to get a foothold there. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, when Mikoyan rolled out the MiG-25 interceptor and MiG-27 ground attack plane, their roles kind of switched over, with Sukhoi starting to develop a new heavy air superiority fighter (the above-mentioned Su-27) in response to the rumors of the F-15 being created in the US (though only kind of, as Mikoyan also developed the MiG-29 for the same purpose).
</li><li> Among the reasons for the West's familiarity with MiG designs are both their high production numbers and the extent to which they've been exported. The MiG-15 and MiG-21 hold the distinctions of being the world's <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-produced_aircraft">most-produced jet and supersonic aircraft<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, respectively. Similarly, in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, the Communist-bloc fighters that Western pilots engaged were exclusively either MiG designs or Chinese copies thereof. Even in the Gulf War, of the 44 Iraqi aircraft - including helicopters and transports - claimed as kills by Coalition pilots, 21 were MiGs.
</li><li> Another reason why westerners wouldn't know about Sukhoi aircraft is that the Su-7 and Su-17 were both short-range single-engined ground attack aircraft that look very similar to both the twin-engined MiG-19 and the twin-engined British-built English Electric Lightning.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4935429/BNP-uses-Polish-Spitfire-in-anti-immigration-poster.html">2009 leaflet for the British National Party in the UK<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which also had all the "supporters'" pictures be of people who weren't actually British or who had called them a bunch of racist douchebags) had a picture of a Spitfire. However, the letters "RF" were clearly visible on it. This quickly identified the aircraft as from <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._303_Polish_Fighter_Squadron">303 Squadron<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. That's right  the BNP were campaigning against Polish migrant workers, using an aircraft which was manned by Polish ace pilots.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/04/02/arizona.flight.diverted/index.html">An interesting note from a passenger on a plane which had a hole ripped in it in flight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A passenger noted:
<div class="indent">"The crew was pretty calm about it. They walked around and checked on everyone," he said. <strong>"But it wasn't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole, but you could feel it and hear the noise."</strong>
</div></li><li> A South Korean newspaper had <a class="urllink" href="http://news.donga.com/3/all/20110723/39013955/1">an article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about two USAF F/A-18 fighter jets landing on Inchon international airport. However, the US Navy uses the F/A-18, not the Air Force. An understandable mistake when you remember in most other countries, including South Korea, fighters are under the sole jurisdiction of their air force; the US is an anomaly for having <em>five</em> services that fly fixed-wing aircraft, three of which also operating fighters.
</li><li> As anyone who does air-crash investigation can tell you, there are two things common to every crash: 1) an eyewitness will tell you that the aircraft was on fire before impact, and 2) an eyewitness will tell you that the engine was sputtering before impact. This is true even if the aircraft in question is a glider or other non-engined, non-flammable type.
</li><li> You would expect an <em>airline</em> to avoid this, but American Airlines once caused a major crash because they were paranoid about wake turbulence. Wake turbulence can be dangerous; however, for a large plane such as an Airbus A300, it isn't anywhere near as dangerous as whoever wrote the Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program used by American Airlines until the mid-2000s apparently thought it was. The flight simulator for wake turbulence included an extreme bank that trainees only got out of with enormous rudder deflections. Enormous as in <em>Airbus specifically warned against them because they could cause rudder failure</em>. In other words, American Airlines was teaching their pilots to overreact to wake turbulence in a dangerous fashion. This idiotic aspect of the program was going to cause a fatal pilot error accident sooner or later, and just two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_587">it did<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, killing all 260 occupants, five poor bystanders, and two dogs (one doggo in the cargo hold, another on the ground). 265 humans and two dogs dead, all because a major airline allowed someone who rolled a 1 on understanding the laws of physics to write training materials.
</li><li> Turbulence in general scares the hell out of airline passengers, because they believe it can knock planes out of the sky. The major danger from air turbulence is injury by passengers and things being knocked around. This is why the pilots turn on the fasten seat belt sign when they encounter it. Otherwise, it's no more dangerous to an airplane than going over a bumpy road is for a car.
</li><li> There are a few urban legends regarding the brace positions passengers are asked to assume in the event of an emergency landing. One is that they exist just to preserve a passenger's teeth so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentificationByDentalRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentificationByDentalRecords">they can be identified after a fiery wreck</a>. Another is that the positions are designed to <em>kill</em> passengers so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">airlines won't have to pay out medical bills</a>. Real-life incidents such as the crash on the Hudson River have shown how effective brace positions are in minimizing injury to passengers so they can escape, especially after the procedures were modified.
</li><li> Any news story on a cabin depressurization event will invariably mention the plane "plummeting" from cruising altitude when the oxygen masks deploy. The pilots are executing their training with a controlled descent, albeit a fast one that might naturally alarm passengers who aren't familiar with it. The point is to get to an altitude with breathable air as quickly as possible, as planes only have about 30 minutes of oxygen when the masks drop down and there will be an inevitable few stragglers who can't get the masks on in time. Hypoxia is nothing to mess around with, and it can cause brain damage and death in minutes. The pilots need oxygen too, obviously.
</li><li> It's apparently something of a tradition in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">Japanese Air Self-Defense Force</a> to play this trope for laughs. On more than one occasion, visitors to airbase open-day events have spotted displays of "stealth planes" that are perhaps a little bit too effective to be true. <a class="urllink" href="https://f.hatena.ne.jp/kmd/20060731020324">The board in this example reads "F-X (Stealth Aircraft)".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
