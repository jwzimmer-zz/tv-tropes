Nothing more and nothing less than what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAWish">the wish</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">explicitly</a></em> states. This is so that when a wish backfires, we can laugh at the foolishness of whoever made the wish, as opposed to the genie, who is supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">just doing their job</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes, though, the literal interpretation just isn't enough. Try as we might, there simply aren't that many wishes which can be literally interpreted to mean "Turn me blue." So when the humiliation <em>really</em> needs to pile on, the Jackass Genie has to make an appearance.
</p><p>What differentiates the Jackass Genie from the Literal Genie is sheer malice. This creature has it in for whoever has the misfortune of being his master and will make whatever bizarre interpretation is necessary to make the master's life a living hell. A Literal Genie will grant the wish as is, with no additional magic good or bad. The Jackass Genie will be the precise opposite of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie">Benevolent Genie</a>, inserting the absolute worst version of any wish.

The Literal Genie will give her a fever (or maybe hook you up with a fire demon). The Jackass Genie will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">set her on fire</a>. Try to head it off and wish for an attractive girlfriend? The Literal Genie will make her magnetic. The Jackass Genie will make her attract <em>tigers</em>. Wish for a beautiful girlfriend? The Literal Genie will give you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a>. The Jackass Genie will give you a beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> girlfriend who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">killed all her previous lovers horribly</a>. Wish for some long overdue social reform? The Literal Genie will create a stagnant society that lacks the conflict necessary for growth, while the Jackass will always opt for an oppressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopia</a> where the fanatics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage">who make your side look bad</a> have won out. Wish for a million dollars?

The Jackass Genie will just give you a million copies of the same dollar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">and call the police on you for counterfeiting</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In short, you just can't win; no matter what you wish for, the Jackass Genie will find a way to twist it so you end up worse off. Expect him to milk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">Metaphorically True</a> for all they're worth. And taking the Literal Genie approach of making sure your wish is very specific is nothing but a trap. Unless you know a rule that he absolutely <em>has</em> to follow, he'll just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">move the goalposts</a> and screw you over anyway: "Oh, the words you used mean something else in a very obscure dialect in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a>." Assuming he doesn't just flat-out lie and claims to have "misheard" you, knowing you can't prove him wrong.
</p><p>You can also expect a Jackass Genie to interpret <em>anything</em> you say as a wish, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalRequestBlunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalRequestBlunder">even if you didn't intend to make one.</a> Never say "I wish I were dead" when this particular genie is within earshot. Your "wish" <em>will</em> be granted. Even the Literal Genie tends to have a tenuous grasp of the concept of hyperbole. Even worse, he may just suddenly set you on fire because "You didn't wish <em>not</em> to be set on fire".
</p><p>As you can plainly see, oftentimes the Jackass Genie just seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">taking cheap shots at characters who are literally helpless before him</a>. As a result, expect him to be the clear villain when he appears. The Literal Genie can be excused somewhat if they're just naturally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditzy</a> or are trying to teach you a lesson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">about being careful what you wish for</a>, but the Jackass Genie can lay no such claim. If there is any lesson to be learned with them, it might be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToBeTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToBeTrue">if an offer seems too good to be true, it is</a>" — after all, this genie acts like a supernatural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">you always had the option to walk away</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wishplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wishplosion">wish none of this ever happened</a>. If you literally wish for the latter, however, don't be too surprised if the genie erases either you, the entire earth, or the universe from history. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> may apply.
</p><p>Genie jackassery is a natural repercussion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenieInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenieInABottle">original mythology</a> since most wish-granting djinn were spirits imprisoned and enslaved by sorcerers (usually <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon">this specific one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and are <em>rather unhappy with their servitude</em>. As such, they will take every opportunity to screw over their master. Genies following this tradition are basically sending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> that "you shouldn't consort with magical beings, full stop". Nowadays that might be because "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">hard work is good for you</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving">Wanting Is Better Than Having</a>".
</p><p>Has nothing to do with fitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackass">Johnny Knoxville</a> in a bottle...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove">or the other way round, knowing him</a>.

Instead, he would stalk you and wait until you said to someone: "I wish you would die," at which point he'd melt the person alive with hell-slime. This is because the "genie" was really a demon.
</li><li> In a chapter of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> manga, Doraemon introduces a robot genie that is literally this trope.

Though in this case, the jackass part is that it's a jackass to the people it's robbing/abducting and <em>not</em> to Nobita.
</li><li> Alluka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> is an interesting example. She has the ability to grant 'any' wish, provided that whoever's with her fulfills three of her requests. The downside is that it's not the wisher who gets screwed... but the <em>next</em> person she asks for her requests. If the previous wish was very complex, her requests become much more severe (such as asking for <em>body parts</em>) and if her requests are refused four times in a row, the person and their loved ones are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">reduced to pools of blood.</a> Her brother Killua reveals that he understands her wish-granting better than everybody else, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can negate all the downsides of this by instead of <em>wishing</em> for her to grant something, <em>commanding</em> her to do it. He's very careful to keep the rest of his family from finding this out, and it's likely that she'll only obey "commands" from Killua since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">he's the only one who treated her like a person, let alone family, rather than just a wish-granting object</a>.</span>

He encountered Polnareff alone and, through his Stand, Judgement promised him 3 wishes. Polnareff first wished for gold, and at first, Kameo seemed honest, creating a glittering pile of treasure with no negative effects whatsoever. Then Polnareff remembered his guilt over not being able to save Sherry or Avdol and wished that they both be brought back to life. Kameo interpreted this as <em>two</em> wishes (giving Polanreff no way to escape the consequences), then led Polnareff to his newly-raised sister and ally...which were actually twisted simulacrums that promptly attempted to kill him.
</li><li> Romeo from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Make5Wishes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Make5Wishes">Make 5 Wishes</a></em>. To make it even worse, the first, small wish that Hanna asks for, for her crush to finally notice her, is granted without any ill effects at all, leading to her becoming bolder and making bigger wishes that backfire on her horribly. For the fifth and final wish, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she thinks he's screwed her over again, but he hasn't. She just doesn't <em>realize</em> that the fifth wish was granted exactly as she wanted</span>.

The main characters figure this out and realize that he can be manipulated into granting selfless wishes if they're phrased in such a way as to sound selfish.
</li><li> The manga <em>Only One Wish</em> by Mia Ikumi (also author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>) revolves around the so-called Angel of Wishes, a mysterious entity looking like a woman in school uniform and witch hat that gives people cell phones to contact her and make a single wish who she'll then proceed to screw over:
<ul><li> The first chapter features the three friends Rikako, Ai and Mai getting the cell phone. Rikako uses her wish to get Ai and her beloved Yamaguchi together, only for Ai to start ignoring them and Yamaguchi later admitting he liked <em>Rikako</em>. When a pissed-off Rikako tries to get back Yamaguchi and Mai tries playing peacemaker, Ai cries out she wishes that Rikako and Mai would disappear <em>while she was in contact with the 'Angel'</em>, who proceeds to summon an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> to eat them until Yamaguchi gets the cell phone and wishes the monster away. Mai, finally, feeling betrayed by her friends, for whom she was willing to renounce to both the wish and Yamaguchi's love, makes an untold wish that is implied will kill them. The 'Angel' did all this just to show that friendship can be a fickle thing.
</li><li> In the second chapter, a girl named Misa, who has drowned to save a cat, wishes to come back to life. The 'Angel' gives her a temporary body and will annul her death if she manages to kiss the boy she loves before midnight... But doesn't tell her that her friend Akio, who died with her and loves her, made a similar wish with the same condition. And Akio doesn't too but decides to help Misa live. The only reason they don't get screwed up when Misa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">throws away her chance to live and kisses Akio</a> is that his wish was to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">stay with her for the following year</a></em>, and the "Angel" decided it meant that they should both live.
</li><li> In the third chapter, a girl named Kumi has a crush on a boy named Kisarazu, and wishes for him to become small so she'll be able to care for him in her home and he'll fall for her. The 'Angel' obliges and enjoys the show when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>: Kisarazu is terrified and is utterly furious when he learns that Kumi is responsible for his condition.
</li><li> The fourth chapter opens with a man lying in his own blood and a high school student crying she didn't mean <em>that</em> when she wished her teacher would disappear, while the "Angel" states she fulfills <em>any</em> wish and that's the wisher's problem if she isn't happy with the result. She later states she'll screw up another wish upon sending a cell phone to a girl in need... and is happy when the girl ignores the cell phone: the "Angel" screws up wishes <em>on purpose</em>, because she doesn't like it when people cry for help at the first problem even when they can actually fulfill their wishes on their own (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">thus explaining why she didn't screw up Akio's wish: bringing people back to life is beyond current human abilities</a>). She ends the chapter and the manga by preparing to screw another wish up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>: The Shikon Jewel is said to be able to grant any wish; in reality, it will twist a wish to its own benefit at worst or simply not grant it at best. It's even stated in-story that <em>every single attempt</em> to use the jewel for good has backfired. What this amounts to at the end of the story when someone is in a position to make that wish is that there's only one precise wish that can be made that will actually work (apparently the Jewel has no power to pervert that one) and anything else will result in doom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kagome wishes for the jewel to vanish from existence forever, which is said precise wish</span>.

</li><li> The Rainy Devil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Bakemonogatari</a></em> makes a deal with Kanbaru Suruga that obviously references <em>Monkey's Paw</em>, to the point where she actually gets her arm replaced with that of a monkey and interprets wishes very liberally and dangerously for everyone involved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted, as instead of misinterpreting anything the devil simply obeys her hidden desires to the letter, which are far darker than what she'd expected.</span>
</li><li> Not a genie, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> has Lord Zuno, an alien being said to know everything in the universe, and only grants a limited number of questions per person. When Bulma goes to him to find out about the Super Dragon Balls, she gets three questions but two are wasted because he interprets <em>any</em> question Bulma says out loud as counting towards her total, even if it's rhetorical or confirming information she'd already gotten.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HowToBuildADungeonBookOfTheDemonKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HowToBuildADungeonBookOfTheDemonKing">How to Build a Dungeon: Book of the Demon King</a></em>. Aur summons Lilu, a succubus, to be his familiar, and prepares for her a <em>very</em> thorough demonic contract to ensure he'll always have the upper hand while dealing with her.
</li><li> This is essentially how Fukuzou Moguro, the titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLaughingSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLaughingSalesman">The Laughing Salesman</a></em>, functions. He approaches someone and offers to make their heart's desire come true, only to screw them over in the end. One episode, for example, has him approach a man who wishes to no longer be lonely. He makes the man think that he's going to meet a beautiful woman at the park, but instead he sets him up as being a pervert who's been preying on women and has him arrested, commenting that this will ensure that the man will receive national attention and never feel alone anymore.

While he grants wishes honestly and fully, he deliberately neglects to tell the wisher a few important details about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">contract</a>—specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that their soul will be removed from their body, and eventually they will become one of the monstrous witches they fight</span>.

Naturally, he wishes to be king so the old man <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns him into a tree and carves a chess piece out of him</span>.
</li><li> The Bog Roosh, a mermaid-witch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a>: The Third Wish</em>. Three mermaids perform a task for her in exchange for a wish for each. The first wishes to be reunited with her lover. The Bog Roosh informs her that said lover is dead, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">raises him as a zombie</a>; he promptly attacks and kills the mermaid. The second mermaid wishes for legs and lungs, so she can be united with the human she loves. The Bog Roosh grants this immediately; as they're at the bottom of the ocean, the ex-mermaid drowns. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">The third mermaid</a> wishes for a lost spear, so she can return it to the grave of her father. The Bog Roosh hands over the spear, and the mermaid safely swims away to deliver it. Apparently, the Bog Roosh is a misanthrope who hates romance, but she respects someone who cares for their parents. <br/><br/>The third mermaid arguably suffers an even worse fate than her sisters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">For no readily apparent reason</a>, returning the spear to her father's grave condemns him to Hell, and when Hellboy kills the Bog Roosh, the mermaid has to take her place. It is more than likely the Bog Roosh knew the girl's father would hate the fact that she sacrificed Hellboy for the sake of a lost object and would condemn her for it, his Hell being the shame and disgrace of his daughter's actions. So yeah, Bog Roosh is a jackass genie through and through.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Babymouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Babymouse">Babymouse</a>: Beach Babe</em>, Babymouse has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> where she finds a bottle with a genie that looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Felicia</a>. She wishes for ice cream and gets pickle flavor (since she didn't specify what kind), she then wishes for straight whiskers, only for the genie to make them straight, but so long that they touch the ground. Finally, she wishes for "someone cool" to play with, only to come back to reality, where she only has her baby brother for a companion.
</li><li> When wishes are made of djinn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em>, they haven't been seen to twist words. However, if the third wish isn't used to put them back in the bottle, they'll go on a rampage instead. In a Cinderella spin-off, we even find out that Aladdin has a genie with one more wish, just to make life hell for anybody who's about to kill him.
</li><li> Played with in G. Willow Wilson's Cairo. The jinn Shams can't make things appear out of thin air when granting wishes, he can only manipulate probability. This results in a surprise for protagonist Shaheed when he wishes that he didn't have to pay for his breakfast.

<ul><li> One story, "Ala-diddly-addin and His Magic Lamp", features Ned Flanders as Aladdin and Homer as a Jackass Genie. First, he complains how long he's been in the lamp, so Aladdin remarks he should have a drink — the genie interprets this as his first wish and grants himself a beer. For his second wish, the starving family wishes for food, so the genie calls up a combination of a strip club and buffet. When the staunchly-faithful Aladdin complains, he passingly tells the genie to "forget I just said that", leading to the genie taking it as his third wish... though this works in Aladdin's favor, as he erases his own memory, so he thinks Aladdin still has a wish. When Aladdin wishes for his dead wife to be alive again, the genie pulls the classic trick and brings her back as a living skeleton, while outright copping to the fact he'd probably have screwed up the wish had it been differently worded. In the end, the genie also wrecks Aladdin's last wish (to "escort himself" out of town), creating a duplicate he winds up getting drunk and crashing with Aladdin's family with.
</li><li> Another story taking place when Homer was a kid had Homer find a mean genie who tried to pressure Homer into making a wish and point-blank telling him that he intends to grant his wishes so that they have negative consequences, such as having Homer's wish for a million dollars result in Homer getting the money illegally and his father getting mad at him for it.

Archie is so warped by anger over this that in a moment of evil, he wishes that REGGIE receive the remainder of his wishes. The moment of evil goes like this: "Are you kidding? I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!" (Archie's eyes glow with skulls for pupils and hellfire for irises as he gets an evil grin) "Or maybe... I would!" Which the old man provides.

For example, when Lambik wished for the genie to give them some allies that didn't have to be very tall, he instead gave their enemies three giants as allies. This is not because the genie is evil or malicious, but more that he is extremely clumsy. He always apologizes afterward for his screw ups. Eventually, both Wiske and Jerom get smart enough to realize the genie's flaw and exploit it by actually wishing for the exact opposite of what they really want. When Jerom defeated the giants, he wished for 3 more giants. The result: the genie screwed up again and accidentally made the 3 already existing giants disappear, exactly what Jerom really wanted.

<ul><li> In the <em>Christmas Tree of Might</em> special, Shenron turns into one of these when he finds that not only was he summoned by the main cast <em>again</em>, lamenting that no-one else seems to find the Dragon Balls, but Krillin, who is standing in the middle of a burned down forest with terrified, homeless animals surrounding them, wishes for the best Christmas tree in the world instead of saving the forest. An angry Shenron responds by summoning a group of alien marauders who plant an evil version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">World Tree</a> that sucks all the Christmas joy out of the world.

</li><li> The new remake of <em>Dead Zone Abridged</em> has Shenron answer Garlic Jr.'s wish for immortality with "can't wait to hear how you fuck this up". It seems if the wish granter is dumb enough, he doesn't even have to twist it. He mostly seems to grant the wish straight out of suprise that, after years of the Z-warriors using every window of opportunity to revive the dead (and one wish for panties) he <em>finally</em> has someone ask for the standard immortality wish.

<ul><li> Jafar, when Abis Mal initially tries to demand his wishes from Jafar instead of wanting to cooperate with him, demonstrates this trope when Abis Mal asks for a legendary sunken treasure. Jafar promptly brings Abis Mal <em>to</em> the treasure, at the bottom of the sea, and forces him to make a second wish to not die.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jafar:</strong> That was two wishes. Take your time with the third... or you will wish you had never been born.

The main differences are that Genie saved an unconscious Aladdin from an assassination attempt out of kindness<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0z98h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0z98h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0z98h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And he only counted it as a wish because he'd already declared "No more freebies" after Al tricked him into getting him out of the Cave of Wonders without expending a wish</span>, while Jafar deliberately put Abis Mal in the ocean and then wasted the wish so he could further manipulate Abis into following his agenda.
</li><li> Later in the movie, Abis Mal muses out loud about wishing for a famous treasure chest of some mythical king. Jafar (who is trying to pressure Abis into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeingTheGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeingTheGenie">setting him free</a>) <em>traps him inside the chest</em>, just to remind him what'll happen if he tries it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jafar:</strong> Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry. I thought that was your wish. Are you quite all right? <br/><strong>Abis Mal:</strong> <em>[irritably]</em> No, I am NOT qui— <br/><strong>Jafar:</strong> Wonderful! Good to see all's well.
</div></li><li> Jafar, however, does give him a freebie regarding all the treasure to Abis Mal's heart's content in exchange for the third wish to set him free from the lamp (after Aladdin is believed to have died). Abis Mal was going to wish for Jafar's freedom, but stops himself and wonders whether Jafar's going to actually keep his word about the treasure, or if the treasure will disappear once being set free, apparently having become skeptical due to Jafar's tendency towards this trope.
</li><li> There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> about the fact that in the <em>Aladdin</em>-verse, genies can't actually kill anyone.

Naveen never actually says anything like this, nor does he even acknowledge this as an accurate "prediction," yet Facilier transforms him into a frog anyways. Naveen agreed to Facilier's deal when he shook his hand, tacitly giving him permission to make the wishes described come true. Although to be fair to Naveen, he had no idea that he was agreeing to anything. Facilier carefully phrased it as such.

She explicitly warns the heroine that she has a history of "dissatisfied customers".

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Films — Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The eponymous genies from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wishmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wishmaster">Wishmaster</a></em> series deliberately interpret any wish they're given in the most negative manner possible—typically involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>—then take the victim's soul to Hell for further torture. For instance, some poor guy is rendered blind simply for answering a question in the negative ("You don't want to see this, do you?") Depending on how vague the wish is, the Djinn can interpret it any way he wants. Near the end of the second film, the casino manager wishes "this nightmare would just be over" and the Djinn decides that means "kill everyone". However, he still has to obey the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> conventions because he can't just ignore a wish because he doesn't like it. When a security guard wishes for him to go away, he's forced to do just that. When he then threatens the guard as he walks away, the guard responds with "The only way you're coming through this door is through me. And that is something I'd love to see." The results <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives">are predictable</a>.

He wishes to be rich and married to his crush and the Devil makes him a Colombian druglord despised by his wife. He wishes to be emotionally sensitive, because chicks dig sensitive guys, so now he can't help but burst into tears if he even glances at a sunset. He wishes to be a great basketball player with a humongous body, and the Devil also makes him stupid and gives him a small penis for no reason at all except to make him waste another wish. He then explicitly asks to be erudite and witty, AND for a big penis, so the Devil makes him gay. He wishes to be President of the United States, so the Devil turns him into Abraham Lincoln on the night he's assassinated. She also counts a demo wish for a Big Mac and fries he made before he'd even signed the contract. At least, in that case, he got what he wanted (even if he had to pay for it).
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bedazzled1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bedazzled1967">Bedazzled (1967)</a></em> does this too. The main character wishes to be a famous rock star, but he almost immediately loses his fans to a new, more popular singer who is, of course, the Devil. His last wish is to be living in peace with the object of his affection far away from the busy city. So the Devil turns them into lesbian nuns.
</li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Leprechaun2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Leprechaun2">Leprechaun 2</a></em> the Leprechaun is trapped in a wrought iron safe by Morty (the leprechaun, being a fae type, is harmed by cold iron), who forces the Leprechaun into granting him three wishes. The Leprechaun grants Morty's wish for his gold by materializing it into his stomach. After the Leprechaun makes Morty waste his second wish by wishing him free of the safe, the Leprechaun grants the third wish (getting the gold out) by ripping Morty open. When Morty whispers "Help me" afterward, the Leprechaun leaves him for dead since he's out of wishes. Suffice it to say, this is the titular Leprechaun's MO in ALL of the films.

The girl asked for (drew) a lollipop. The pencil materialised a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> black hole which sucked her in</span>.

However, she neglects to negotiate her return to shore. Barbossa quickly abuses this by kidnapping her, stating that her return to shore was not part of the agreement, and so he "must" do nothing. Of course, as he points out, the Pirate's Code is for <em>pirates</em>. In a sense, he was being courteous by negotiating with her at all.
</li><li> Secondly, when Will reveals himself as the son of Bootstrap Bill (meaning Barbossa explicitly needs him alive), he negotiates that in return for giving himself up, the crew will not be harmed, and Elizabeth goes free. The crew ends up imprisoned (no word on what the final plan for the crew was after the curse was broken), and Elizabeth was forced to walk the plank with Jack and marooned on a deserted island.
<div class="indent"><strong>Will:</strong> Barbossa, you lying bastard! You swore she would go free! <br/><strong>Barbossa:</strong> Don't you impugn me honor, boy!

Just to show how old this trope is, the characters in this story were aware of it and more worried one of them was going to be killed by the money falling from the sky in change and beaning them on the head. However, it is instead received via the eldest son dying in a horrible accident at work and the corporation giving them a settlement out of pity (because this story was written in an age where lawsuits for this kind of thing were unheard of). It gets worse: The mother is so distraught she forces her husband to wish the son alive again — but she didn't specify what shape she wanted him back in. It turns out his fatal accident had horribly mutilated him, and they hear a knock on the door. We never do find out just what shape the son is in, because when the mother goes to answer the door, the father rushes back in order to make his final wish, which is presumably to wish the son dead and back in his grave, because when the mother opens the door, no one is there. Though some versions have him as a literal zombie, growling and scratching at the door.

Only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">youngest brother</a> sees through the ruse and has his reward tailored specifically to prevent Death doing this to him.

They can only be coaxed out of the bottle with the promise to play the 'game of jynn', where they match wits with the human that freed them. So presenting the client human with three wishes, and placing some kind of sadistic twist to the request is their only motivation to grant wishes in the first place. Granted, the only persons that can gain possession of a genie are some very old and canny sorcerers, who believe they can outwit the genie. So at least there is sport in this contest. This genie was a cross between a Jackass Genie and a Literal Genie, in that he cannot change the original wish or add on to it, and that the game has a very specific goal: to grant the wisher nothing in the end. So one previous, not-so-clever, non-sorcerous player of the game wished for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"wealth", so the genie granted enormous wealth on the spot, such that the wisher could not carry it away before bandits stole it. However, the genie had to rely on already nearby bandits, and the genie only partially won because the man grabbed some of the wealth and ran since the wish neither allowed for creating bandits from nothing nor sealing away the wealth so the man couldn't reach it</span>.

<ul><li> Mat mistakes them for their answer-granting cousins, the Aelfinn, and when they won't answer his questions, he starts venting his frustrations on them instead, which they take as his wishes. They grant his wishes in the laziest way possible, and the wishes also come with a price that can be negotiated. Since he doesn't name a price and doesn't specify that he wants to leave their realm alive, they hang him. On the other hand, since he survived being hanged, the things they gave him did actually fulfill the wishes; to let him "be free of Aes Sedai," they gave him a nifty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> amulet, to "fill the empty holes in his memories" they shoved his head full of multiple lifetimes' worth of experiences, and as a kicker they gave him a pimpin' magic spear <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that fulfills his third wish, for a way out of the Eelfinn realm; it doubles as a magic key that can carve open gateways leading out of their domain</span>.

The original legendary helm was the product of a sorcerer-smith who, when captured by his enemies, was asked by them to create a helmet that would make the wearer impervious to all harm. When the helm was donned, the demon he'd bound into it <em>bit the wearer's head off</em> — nothing can harm a dead person.

It's basically slavery), and actively search for any loophole in the magician's power or orders. In addition to usual malicious literalness, one popular method they use is to creatively interpret pauses for breath as periods, rendering commands completely worthless if the magician can't get them off in one breath. Some spirits are more creative with this than others. They usually <em>do</em> follow orders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">as long as they are worded correctly without obvious loopholes</a>, but it is mentioned that Nathaniel once encountered one who allegedly required a command half an hour long just to correctly fill his bath. Most spirits are reluctant to go that far, as wizards don't require a spirit's assistance to use torture spells on their slaves.
<ul><li> Also, that's not even getting into what happens if a demon learns the summoner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueName">True Name</a>, or worse if the summoner botches a summoning ritual. When trying to summon high-level spirits, even the smallest mistake can get one eaten alive.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bartimaeus:</strong> One magician I worked for once called for my aid during an earthquake which was toppling his tower.

As a default clause of the contract, the guy demands to be made immortal and invincible to any harm except for the effects of his wishes.

The immediate response, "Old age", turns out not to work because she has to die that day. After some questions, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the genie, having really been imprisoned in the bottle for only two hundred and seventeen years, was actually required to grant Cimorene three wishes — however, for the genie to return home without killing Cimorene would render him a laughingstock.

He turns out to be a pretty good sport about the whole thing, though; in return for the brilliant idea, he grants Cimorene a wish, so she uses it to get the hen's teeth she's been looking for.

In order...
<ul><li> 1) Main character Samantha Byrd wishes to be 'the strongest player on her basketball team'. The witch doesn't make her stronger, but everyone else weaker, to the point where the star players come down with severe illnesses. This leads to a scene where said star player (and bully) Judith is accusing Samantha of being a witch herself...
</li><li> 2) Samantha angrily wishes <em>JUDITH</em> would disappear. The witch makes <em>EVERYONE IN THE WORLD</em> disappear as well. Because...the wish is hard to aim?
</li><li> 3) Samantha wishes everyone back and wishes that Judith 'thought she was the greatest'. This, as you might have guessed, makes Judith obsessed with Samantha and how 'perfect' she is to the point of insanity, forcing Samantha to flee and running into the witch again after her three wishes had been used up.
</li><li> 4) Given one last wish, Samantha wishes 'she had never met the witch....that Judith had met the witch instead'. Reality returns to what it previously was, but then Judith (no longer aware she was there because she was obsessively chasing Samantha) says "Why don't you fly away, Byrd?" for the thirteenth time in the book, and Samantha is turned into a bird.

You ask for the boon, and the Nighwatcher gives you a curse <em>she</em> feels is equivalent, which might be related to the wish, but more often is not. One person wished for a bunch of cloth, and was cursed to the world upside down for the rest of his life. In addition, she's not even obliged to give you what you asked for, though she does usually try.

</li><li> Leonid Kudryavcev wrote a story "Genie" describing the worst possible example of this trope.

The story ends with the Rat King carrying the lamp to a faraway land for a hefty reward. Meanwhile, genie inside the lamp wonders whether the Rat King spent enough time with humans to be infected with their insanity. After all, the temptation is big as he only needs one more wish to learn the exceptions in the rules and the way to formulate a safe wish.

When Pukah, pretending to get carried away, shouts "A new lamp and a new basket for my master!" the distracted Meelusk absently shouts "Yes, yes!", dropping their dwellings and letting the hero Khardan pick them up again.

Even if they were "three wishes you have to get exactly right", they were still incredibly valuable.

This can, occasionally, backfire on the demon in question... for instance, in one Season Six episode, Halfrek curses everyone at the Summers house to stay in the house forever, and then makes the mistake of dropping by the house to gloat, with the result that she gets stuck in her own curse and has to reverse it. Another example is an unnamed vengeance demon's head exploding after a wisher asked for the heads of every other female in town to explode.

The catch is, however, that once he grants your wishes you get trapped in his bottle and he is set free, and the only way to escape is to learn magic (which will take thousands of years according to the genie) and grant wishes to trade out with another victim.

When the man refuses, the Imagin starts physically attacking him and yelling at him to open the damn box. In this case, it springs from the Imagins' agenda: when they successfully complete a contract, they can then open a portal to the past using their contractor's strongest memory (in this case, the day the man and his fiancée buried the capsule), at which point they go on a rampage and try to alter history.
</li><li> Curiously, some of them go out of their way to be jackasses even when a simpler solution exists. In episode 11-12, a doctor makes the wish that he "wants to see his daughter". (Said daughter is a teen fashion idol, and he intentionally cut ties with her so she could realize her career instead of staying with him.) The imagin could have gone off and kidnapped the girl and brought her to the father, but instead, it interprets the wish as "destroy her career so she'll have to go back", possibly because it'd allow more opportunities to rampage.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist">Round the Twist</a></em> episode "Santa Claws", when each member of the family gets two wishes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpecialUnit2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpecialUnit2">Special Unit 2</a></em> has a unique case. The genie in question doesn't actually have magic powers, other than being able to turn into dust and hide in small objects. Thus, when people make outrageous wishes, she has to fulfill them personally. For example, when a guy asked for a million dollars, she walked off, robbed a bank, then left him with the evidence and the cops on his ass while she disappeared. She still interprets such wishes negatively, though, because she wants to get through them as fast as possible. Once she reaches her quota, she'll have free will.

Of course, this still somewhat counts, since a) most people they deal with are either very desperate, or just gullible idiots in over their head, and b) when the allotted time is up and it's time for your soul to be collected, the manner in which this is done is to have you ''hunted down by hellhounds who rip you to shreds", whereupon you wake up in the abyss to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">tortured into becoming a demon yourself</a>.

Fortunately, it is discovered that genie's lamp has a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> that undoes all the wishes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> episode "Je Souhaite", the genie is a Literal Genie, but the genie who turned her into a genie seems to have been a jackass genie. She was living in medieval France, and had made three wishes — a stout mule, a magic bag full of turnips, and "great power and a long life." The genie decided to use that last wish to turn her into a genie trapped in his place. Jerk. She herself tends to be pretty mean also, but only when the wishes are stupid. Which, according to her, is "all the time":
<div class="indent"><strong>Mulder:</strong> You know, I think I'm beginning to see the problem here. You say that most people make the wrong wishes, right? <br/><strong>Jenn:</strong> Without fail. It's like giving a chimpanzee a revolver.
</div><ul><li> She can also do this even when the wishes aren't that stupid. A man who lived in a trailer park wished for a yacht... which she put <em>in</em> the trailer park claiming he didn't ask for it to be in the water.

<ul><li> Nanabozho, the trickster spirit of Ojibwa mythology, is once visited by a group of humans. One wishes for eternal life and is turned into a stone. Another wishes to be lucky at hunting and is turned into a fox. The rest, seeing where it is going, ask to enchant their talismans with healing power. This time, Nanabozho grants the wish because they don't ask for too much. Later, caught in an Orpheus plot, they end up losing it anyway.
</li><li> Most wish-granting genies in the Arabian tales are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie">Benevolent Genies</a>, but then, they didn't have to grant wishes, either.

Thus taking Jackass Genie to a whole new (old?) level. The modern mythos of the genie is the result of the mythological equivalent of the telephone game. Originally, the point of the wish-granting genie wasn't that it granted wishes; it was supposed to impress upon you how powerful some sorcerer or other was (since djinn were actually very powerful spirits that roamed about doing more-or-less than whatever they damn well pleased) that he managed to trap a genie at all. Another version of the mythos is that some trapped Djinn <em>were</em> originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie">Benevolent Genies</a>, but didn't particularly enjoy being imprisoned and forced into servitude by a powerful sorcerer, making their resentment and transformation into a Jackass Genie end up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">rather justified</a>.

And Alamanda says she loves him ... with her final breath.</span>
</li><li> At one point, <em>Dragon Magazine</em> dedicated an article to fleshing out a list of different types of wishes. Besides Benevolent and Malevolent, there were also Half wishes (Deliver half the wish and cut it in half in a creative way), Misinterpretation wishes (guaranteed to always hear at least one word wrong in some way), and several more options for making the act of wishing that much more uncertain.

<ul><li> When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> awards a roleplayer a wish, this trope often results in the player taking twenty minutes to formulate their wish to ensure that it comes out as planned. "... and I want it to happen now and I don't want to lose it later and I don't want anyone to get hurt for me to obtain it and I want it to be accessible and..."
</li><li> In earlier editions, before wishes had set limits, there was a certain type of GM who basically used wishes to troll by waiting for players to ask for absurd things and then ruining them for doing so. The player wishes to be an immortal? The GM may make them a mountain, or maybe change the character's name to "Anne Immortal". The player wishes for vast wealth? They are teleported to a vein of gold beneath the earth with no means to survive the pressure or heat, or rewarded with a vast sum of acorns and transformed into a squirrel. The list goes on and on. However, this is against the terms of the spell as written even in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, where wishes have general limitations on what they can and can't get done.
</li><li> It's important to note that the above-mentioned "free-form" version of the <em>wish</em> spell came from the old <em>AD&amp;D 2nd Edition</em> rules. In D&amp;D 3.0 and 3.5, "Wish" and "Miracle" spells have a set of specific game-mechanical effects that they're explicitly allowed to accomplish with no penalty. Additionally, the spell description also says that the DM should let wishes of a similar power level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie">work the way the player wants them to</a> — and because <em>wish</em> is, canonically, <em>the</em> most powerful spell a wizard can cast<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30flm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note30flm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30flm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> At least, it's the most powerful spell a Level 20 wizard can cast.</span>, it ought to be capable of doing some pretty impressive things. It's only if the players go overboard that the DM is supposed to stop it, either by playing Jackass Genie with their phrasing or, if that isn't possible, by simply having the power of the spell be over-stretched and fail to get the job done. (The 3.0 Player's Guide has an example of the latter: a wizard wishing that everyone in the land considers him their rightful king ends up with everybody simply realizing that the wizard tried and failed to magically control their minds.)
</li><li> The <em>D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia</em> version of the <em>wish</em> spell recommends that not only should wishes be carefully worded to avoid poor interpretations, but that if the wish is carefully worded but unbalanced, the DM should go <em>out of his way</em> to come up with a negative interpretation. The given example, "I wish to immediately and permanently gain the gaze attack power of a basilisk while retaining all my current treasure and class features," is given an example result of the character growing a second, basilisk head.
</li><li> And 4th Edition did away with <em>wish</em> altogether, at least as a spell that players can cast. It remained in the form of a ritual available only to pit fiends (the highest-ranking type of devil, short of the archdevils) that allows them to grant a mortal's wish once every 99 years... but if you're going to trust the outcome of your wish to a freakin' <em>pit fiend</em>, you deserve whatever you get.
</li><li> Fifth Edition has brought back <em>Wish</em>, but with the major caveat that a caster using it to do something other than duplicating a spell has a 33 percent chance of being unable to cast it ever again. This applies even if the spell is cast through a magic item.
</li><li> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> also has actual genies, though only the "noble" ones (about 1% of them) can actually grant wishes. The description of noble efreeti (the evil type of genies that come from the Elemental Plane of Fire) specifically says, "Whenever possible, an efreeti will twist the words of a wish to bring pain and destruction upon the wisher."
<ul><li> To prove that the game designers are evil, the only genies kept in the 4E Monster Manual were Efreeti... and the books <em>specifically stress</em> that they act like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demons</a> until someone presses them into servitude... like, say, to grant a wish.
</li><li> The good news is that despite legends to the contrary, the 4e Efreeti can't actually grant wishes. The bad news is that they've cultivated enough connections and favors to perform a remarkable simulation. If you're kind enough to release one from servitude, it might grant a "wish" for you in thanks — and actually uphold the spirit of the wish as best it can due to its sense of honor — but it can also twist a "wish" or just generally make the rest of your (blessedly short) life hell if you try to force it into servitude.
</li><li> The second Monster Manual brought back the actual Djinn (genies of air, described as "master engineers of the fabulous"), many of whom were sealed away in objects (like the traditional lamp) after the end of the Dawn War between Primordials and Gods. They don't grant wishes any more than the Efreeti do, but they are grateful to those who help them and will usually reward somebody who aids them considerably. Oppose them, however, and you're screwed.
</li></ul></li><li> The effects of a Jackass Genie DM are arguably removed with the Wish-equivalent psionic powers "Bend Reality" and "Reality Revision". They function the same as Limited and Unlimited Wish, respectively, but since Psionics is <em>thought</em>, the power would affect the way the manifester <em>thinks</em>. Intention over interpretation through the power of thought, no messy words to get in the way. However, on that note, if you try to stretch these powers too far, it simply flat-out fails, and just wasted a bunch of psychic power and time to no effect. And also, you even must explain it your wish to your GM, and he can act as the Jackass Genie. "Oh, so you wanted to alter the reality so you could be the greatest Psion? Well, now you're sixty feet tall. You SAID me that was your wish, player". Rule Zero, my friends!
</li><li> On a related note, the Clerical version, "Miracle" is adjudicated by the caster's god (despite functioning via the spellcasting game mechanics, a cleric doesn't actually <em>cast</em> a miracle, they <em>request</em> one) — if they ask for too much, or something not following the god's philosophy, god says "no", and you waste time and a spell. And in the later case, the GM could reasonably have the god punishing the cleric for their temerity.
</li><li> Of course, as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reallifecomics.com/comic.php?comic=title-1138">this strip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RealLifeComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RealLifeComics">Real Life Comics</a></em> shows, even if the wish itself works out exactly as you want, the DM can still screw you around.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BinderOfShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BinderOfShame">Binder of Shame</a></em>, Ab3 of RPG.Net fame notes that some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">Killer Game Masters</a> do this as their <em>very style of running a game</em>. In the RPG.Net rant, "A Night at the Inn, a Day at the Racists", he recounts the tale of Psycho Dave, one particular such Game Master:
<div class="indent"><em>As you can see I soon realized that Psycho Dave ran a game in roughly the same way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarwickDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarwickDavis">Warwick Davis</a> in the film </em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Leprechaun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Leprechaun">Leprechaun</a><em> granted wishes. Everything you said your character did was scrutinized for some way to screw you over and the dice ruled all. He was the only guy I know who used a random monster encounter chart for </em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a><em>. You haven't lived until you've had a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">go mad</a> because he saw a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">nightgaunt</a> sitting in a restroom stall reading a copy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Necronomicon</a>.</em>
</div></li><li> Leprechauns could act like this, but with a twist. If a leprechaun is captured by a mortal or his pot of gold is stolen, he can offer the mortal three wishes in exchange for his or the pot of gold's release (but is only capable of granting what is permitted by the Limited Wish spell). If the mortal agrees, the leprechaun will indeed grant the wishes, doing so in a way that will tempt the mortal into wanting more. After doing so, he'll offer the mortal a <em>fourth</em> wish as a bonus. If the mortal falls for this and makes a fourth wish, a type of Leprechaun Law will allow the leprechaun to undo the effects of the three wishes and then teleport the wisher and his companions hundreds of miles away; they'll never be able to find that particular leprechaun again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The setting has a monster called a Wishing Imp, a magical statue that you CANNOT get rid of, that will explicitly try to pervert anything even remotely possible to be interpreted as a wish... It DOES classify as a curse though, the idea is that you should want to get rid of it.
</li><li> Similarly, the Dark Powers seem to spend a lot of time thinking up ways to give Darklords exactly what they say they want and take away what they actually want. Such as Strahd's desire to evade death bringing with it the deaths of everyone he cared about.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> usually goes this way too, with the <em>D&amp;D</em> devils being malicious but always keeping their side of the bargain.

<ul><li> The module features a cursed gem that purports to grant wishes; when the wish is made, it will do an exact opposite or otherwise turn the wish against you (given example: when asked to bring somebody back from the dead, it'll instead destroy his remains, or even kill somebody else), AND then it explodes, burning everybody in the vicinity to death.
</li><li> There's also an efreeti in a bottle. If the players try to bargain with the efreeti to let him out, he'll grant three wishes but will be a jackass about it. If the players mishandle his bottle in any way he won't even give them that; he simply attacks them outright. If the players open the bottle without attempting to bargain with the efreeti, however, he'll grant their three wishes without any malice.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>:
<ul><li> The adventure path "Legacy of Fire" plays with this. The main antagonist is a genie who's adding minor twists to every wish he grants so that it moves him closer to his ultimate goal; towards the end he resorts to just forcing people to wish for the things he wants to do at swordpoint, but prior to that he tends to just rely on riders and quirks to get what he wants. Meanwhile, the genie backing the heroes is effectively the head of the Society for the Promotion of Ethical Wishcraft and will only engage in this if the player characters keep wishing for stuff she's not willing to give them, like a way to end-run around the adventure or win fights automatically.
</li><li> Glabrezu demons specialize in doing this. Their main schtick is tempting and corrupting mortals by offering them whatever they wish, and then using their magic to give it to them — and, since glabrezus are just as evil and sadistic as any other demon, deliberately twisting said wish to cause as much harm and grief as possible. For instance, a smith wishing for fame and recognition might end up with a wealthy patron — who happens to be a cruel warmonger who uses the smiths weapons to spread death and misery. Or someone grieving over the death of a loved one might see them brought back from the dead — as a vampire. And so on.
</li></ul></li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> supplement offers a perk that causes any wish the character makes to err in his favor automatically specifically to avoid players writing out multipage wishes to avoid getting screwed over. Needless to say, it's a tad over-powered for what should be a relatively minor ability.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, Daemons of Tzeentch love using this trope. It helps that most people are too terrified by their appearance to focus on wording the wish correctly. It should also be mentioned that Tzeentch and his servants have an infamous reputation amongst tabletop players and especially 1d4 chan for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Trolls</a>, due to their Jackass Genie tendencies.
<ul><li> The <em>Warhammer</em> spinoff game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mordheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mordheim">Mordheim</a></em> features a character who made the mistake of wishing for a Lord of Change to make him the greatest mage in the world. The daemon did just that, making him 15 feet tall.
</li><li> A story from the "Tales of the Ten-Tailed Cat" comic has three adventurers releasing a Lord of Change, who grants them all one wish. The first wishes to live forever, and is turned into a vampire and then killed by the dwarf. The second wishes for the power of flight, and is turned into a fly. Finally, the dwarf wishes to be worth his weight in gold and is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turned into a gold statue</span>.
</li><li> The Changeling (also a Tzeentchian Daemon) is even worse. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, he once "assisted" a rebellious governor who found himself standing on the wrong end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Dark Angels</a> assault. The Changeling bargained the souls of the man's daughters for a device that would bring the siege to an end. It turned out to be the teleportation homer for a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Deathwing Terminators</a>. Naturally, the siege <em>quickly</em> ended.
</li><li> Tzeentch himself likes to join in the fun on occasion; once, he overheard a Space Marine Chapter Master who, worried that his Chapter's dealing with the Inquisition was killing more innocents than heretics, prayed for a means to tell who was lying and who wasn't. Tzeentch "blessed" the Chapter by letting them hear <em>every single lie spoken in the entire Imperium</em>. The unlucky recipient swiftly went insane and turned traitor in almost record time.
</li></ul></li><li> This is one of the side effects <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> suggests using on mages who abuse the Fate arcana. Bend fate so you meet a friendly, cute girl in the bar? OK. Do it over and over again? Turns out she's a psycho-stalker, or she has an STD and 'whoops' looks like you should have used protection.

Due to a rather unpleasant war and the work of Solomon teaching humans how to trap and control Djinni, they're usually pretty pissed at humanity, and ESPECIALLY the Taftani Craft whose magic works by and large by messing with Djinn. Needless to say, you'd best be VERY careful when giving a Djinni orders, and only the Taftani have much of the knowledge required to actually command them long term without Jackass issues popping up. (It's outright stated that powerful Taftani have entire PALACES floating over deserts, with hundreds of Djinni servants maintaining the place and its magic, in addition to Djinni concubines, cooks, and even Djinni who are skilled at games for entertainment.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em> has a <em>Limited Wish</em> (and TOB a full-powered <em>Wish</em>) spell. Just like the other D&amp;D examples, it WILL twist your wishes if you are not careful. "I wish to be more experienced." makes it summon a horde of monsters for you to (try to) kill, for instance. "I want to go on an adventure like one I've never been on before!" sends you on a quest to track down someone's grandmother's gong from a variety of improbable characters... Wishing to be prepared against the undead makes it summon a group of hostile vampires while giving you no additional protection against them whatsoever.
<ul><li> In this game, "being careful" means ensuring that your caster has a high enough Wisdom score to word the wishes properly, or by using "bad" effects to your advantage. Having the genie "summon an army" nets you 50 rabbits. Needless to say, a bunch of harmless, completely ordinary bunnies won't do any damage by themselves, but they make for a very nice distraction: enemies tend to attack the closest target, so if the rabbits are between you and the enemies, the enemies will waste turns attacking the rabbits while you pepper them with arrows and blast them with magic. Similarly, the horde of monsters summoned if you wish for experience is always a group of golems (though the exact number and type are based off your level), and there are several magic weapons in the game that are extremely powerful against golems, so if prepared you can get a lot of experience points for very little effort.

A quest involves helping a wizard get his soul back from a devil after he promised it in exchange for more power. The solution is to examine the contract carefully and then get some details out of the wizard. The contract is null if the devil does anything to force the wizard fulfill a condition against his will. One of the conditions is that the wizard murder someone. Part of the contract was granting the wizard a single wish, which the wizard turns out to have unwittingly used to escape his mentor — as the wizard fled, he was thinking about how much he wanted his mentor "gone". The devil interpreted the thought as a wish and disintegrated the wizard's mentor. Thus, he claimed, the wizard had murdered someone and fulfilled the condition... but the wizard did not want his mentor <em>dead</em>, only "gone". By <em>killing</em> the wizard's mentor, rather than getting rid of him any other way, the devil forced the wizard into fulfilling a condition. Point this out, and the devil is dragged back to the Lower Planes without the promised soul, cursing your name.

<ul><li> In your first wish, the CEO offers you a choice between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">eternal life</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalLove">Eternal Love</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> picking eternal life will summon an extremely hungry vampire into the room while picking eternal love sets you up for a date with a <em>violently</em> horny succubus. For good measure, once you've killed that particular attacker, the CEO remarks that the succubus really did love you — it's just she didn't know how to express it</span>.
</li><li> The second wish offers you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">money</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyIsNotPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyIsNotPower">power</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> choosing money gets you a single PAX credit — though picking it up causes another credit to appear in front of you, so you can technically earn quite a lot if you have the inventory space for it. But if you pick power, you get... a common household battery. Even the CEO apologizes for the terrible joke</span>.
</li><li> Lastly, you're given a choice between musical talent and knowledge. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Technically, this is the most beneficial of the wishes, but you've still got to jump through the hoops if you want it to actually benefit you. If you pick music, you're given a flute identical to the one encountered in "The Christmas Conspiracy," and are told to follow the music prompts; if you succeed, you get to keep the flute as a nifty cosmetic item. If you pick knowledge, you have to answer a series of riddles, the last of which can only be answered if you've been listening to the CEO's hints and can guess his true name: <strong>Mephistopheles.</strong> Answering correctly nets you a fragment of otherwise unattainable lore... about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGeniesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGeniesAreDifferent">the Jinn</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> there is the Skull Heart, which can grant any young woman her wish. If, however, that young woman's heart is impure, it will corrupt even a completely selfless wish into something horrible, and turn the wisher into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> to boot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Skull Heart is also alive and sentient, wanting to make new Skullgirls to destroy the world. Its definition of "impure" is such that even the slightest iota of self-interest within a wish will make it turn the user into a Skullgirl.</span>
<ul><li> The past Skullgirls' wishes are as follows: Selene Contiello wished to bring back her family, recently murdered by Black Dahlia. She became the Skullgirl, and her family was brought back as mindless undead minions. Queen Renoir wished to stop a massive world war. That wish was fulfilled by making her a Skullgirl so horrible and destructive that the countries <em>had</em> to stop fighting each other just to take her down. Ironically, the only Skullgirl whose wish seems to be fulfilled in a satisfactory way is that of the current Skullgirl, who wished for revenge against the Medici crime syndicate and depending on the story route chosen, gets her revenge before falling apart.
</li><li> In the story endings, some of the characters make wishes on the Heart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fillia</span> wishes to restore a normal life to Painwheel. Her wish is nearly pure, so she becomes a Skullgirl slowly, but Painwheel receives a normal life <em>as Painwheel</em>, and doesn't have any memory of her former life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Parasoul</span> wishes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Umbrella</span> will never become the Skullgirl, so she is made the Skullgirl in her place. The only wish that isn't corrupted in any way is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Valentine</span>'s because she wished to become the Skullgirl. Miss Fortune narrowly avoids it: just as she's about to make a wish she realizes that this trope is in play and opts to destroy the Skull Heart, instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlayTheSpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlayTheSpire">Slay the Spire</a>:</em> The Ironclad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">sold his soul to demons</a> in exchange for making him the strongest warrior in his clan. The demons killed the rest of his clan and told him that since he's the only one left, he's now the strongest by default. That said, many of his cards have him using powerful demonic abilities, so it's possible they actually granted him the strength he asked for and then killed his clan <em>anyway</em> just to be even bigger assholes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheSecretRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheSecretRings">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a></em>: Erazor Djinn, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Ironically enough, the one time he actually does fulfill a wish, he does them perfectly, and every wish is exactly how Sonic wants it. To be fair to Erazor, Sonic was holding his lamp at the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a> — Shadow of Chernobyl</em> has various endings, two "right" ones and five "false" ones which involve the main character finding a large stone called the Monolith, also known as the Wish Granter. Depending on what the player has done in the game, he will make one of five possible wishes. All of them backfire.
<ul><li> If he says "I want to be rich", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he sees coins falling from the sky. In reality, the roof collapses and crushes him</span>.
</li><li> If he says that "Humanity is corrupt and must be controlled", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we see flashes of war, death, and other atrocities, then we see him left alone in a void</span>.
</li><li> If he wishes for the Zone to disappear, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we see him in a pristine countryside, but his eyes are blanked out</span>.
</li><li> If he says "I want to be immortal", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turns into a statue</a></span>.
</li><li> If he says "I want to rule the world", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's disintegrated and absorbed into the Monolith</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal">Twisted Metal</a></em>, Calypso grants the winner one wish. Unfortunately, he is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>. It's toned down in the first game, where he's closer to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> and even tries to warn some winners of the dangers of their wishes, but in the sequels, this trope is in full effect.
<ul><li> The drivers of Outlaw in the first two games and <em>Twisted Metal: Head-On</em> get caught in a cycle of these. Officer Carl Roberts, the driver in the first game, wished to be in a world free of the Twisted Metal tournament. Calypso responded to this by hurling him into space, a place where Twisted Metal wasn't held. In the second game, the driver of Outlaw 2, Carl's sister Jamie, demands to see her brother, and Calypso responds by hurtling <em>her</em> into space the same way he did her brother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> on her part, as she was smart enough to modify her police car for space flight. She rescues her brother and the two return to Earth, plotting revenge.</span> Finally, in <em>Head-On</em>, Carl and Jamie get into an argument over whether or not to just shoot Calypso right there. Carl accidentally wishes for Jamie to "shut up", and Calypso <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WipeThatSmileOffYourFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WipeThatSmileOffYourFace">erases her mouth</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">Matrix</a></em>-style.
</li><li> In <em>Twisted Metal: Black</em>, Roadkill's driver John Doe, an amnesiac character, wants to know who he was. Calypso grants his wish <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and then shoots him, because he was an FBI agent and Calypso is on the FBI's 10 most wanted list</span>.
</li><li> Dollface, the driver of Darkside in <em>Black</em>, wishes to be able to take off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume">her unremovable mask</a> from which she gets her moniker. She's given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> when it turns out that taking the key to the mask will also mean killing her former employer, the guy who locked her in it in the first place, but since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">he had it coming</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">she goes through with it</a>... only to decide that she's fine wearing her mask until she grows old.
</li><li> In <em>Head-On</em>, Krista, the ghostly driver of Grasshopper and daughter of Calypso, wishes to undo the car crash that killed her and her mother. The crash is erased from history... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Krista is put into an indefinite coma in a swingset accident to make up for it</span>. With this, it would even appear that Calypso is not in total control of his Jackass Genie ways, as even he is depressed by the outcome of this wish. Most likely Karma in his case.
</li><li> Hammerhead's ending from <em>TM2</em> is an odd example. The drivers wished to gain the ability to fly... and as soon as Calypso said "Wish granted", they jumped off the edge of the building and fell to their deaths, leaving him standing there dumbfounded with a pair of plane tickets in his hand. So while he <em>was</em> pulling a jackass interpretation of their wish, he wasn't actually going to harm them personally — their deaths were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">all on them</a>.
</li><li> The third game, one of the two <em>Twisted Metal</em> games that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">don't exist</a>, was especially bad when it came to this. The character Axel wishes to become completely mechanical, so Calypso turns him into a wristwatch. Angela wants to sit at home and watch TV all day, so Calypso ties her to a chair and forces her to watch nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infomercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infomercial">infomercials</a>. The cops want a crime-free world. Okay, great, now they're out of a job and destitute on the streets since there's no need for police anymore. One character wishes to party all night long, so he gets sent to Antarctica where nights last for 6 months. The demon Minion wishes to spend eternity in hell and ends up trapped in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell,_Michigan">Hell, Michigan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> On the other hand, though, there were a few characters where he honestly granted their wish. Endings involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a> (such as No-Face, Mr. Grimm, Raven, and Billy Ray Stillwell's endings in <em>Twisted Metal: Black</em>) are usually granted with no strings attached, as they are pretty simple ones that screw someone else over. The first game also had Calypso generally be more honest with his wishes, with the only driver who got unambiguously screwed being Carl Roberts, the driver of Outlaw — and that was likely because he made a wish (ending the Twisted Metal contest) that served as a metaphorical slap in Calypso's face.
<ul><li> There is some room for ambiguity on the part of Bruce Cochrane, the driver of Thumper in the first game. Having lived his whole life in fear within a neighborhood constantly torn apart by gang violence, he wished for all of that to end, and Calypso granted his wish. Bruce returned to his neighborhood to find that "... Calypso was not lying." There are two interpretations for that ending — either Calypso brought peace to the neighborhood, or he killed everyone so that there would be nobody left to kill and rob each other.
</li><li> In <em>Head-On</em>, Mortimer simply wishes to be able to return to his grave and sleep again. Calypso grants him this wish exactly as intended with no strings attached. Cousin Eddy's ending has him simply ask for a better RV, which Calypso grants just to make him leave him alone.
</li><li> In <em>Twisted Metal: Black</em>, No-Face, a former boxer, had gotten his ass kicked in a boxing match and was then malevolently butchered and mutilated by a back-alley doctor who lost money betting on him, having his eyes and tongue removed and his eyelids and mouth sewn shut. His wish was for revenge against the doctor. The next scene shows the doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> while No-Face is putting on a boxing glove covered with knives and scalpels. The scene ends just as the boxing glove is about to make contact with the doctor's face.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also cases where the driver really did get their wish granted, but it ended badly for them.
<ul><li> In the first game, the driver of Roadkill wishes to go back in time to undo the deaths of his platoon in the jungles of South America. Calypso tries to warn him of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">how dangerous this wish is</a>, but grants it anyway. He is sent back in time and is almost immediately shot and killed at point blank range by an enemy soldier.
</li><li> Also in the first game, Charlie Kane, the driver of Yellow Jacket, asked for information on his son's whereabouts. It turned out that his son Needles was the driver of Sweet Tooth and a wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>, and that Charlie had actually killed him that night during the contest, helping to bring a feared criminal to justice. Charlie leaves with a sense of anguish and plans to re-enter the competition next year and wish for Calypso to take away his suffering.
</li><li> In the second game, Mr. Slam's driver, Simon Whittlebone, wished to build the tallest building ever, and he got his wish. However, he then got worried that other people would break his record, and so kept building his tower higher. In the end, he accidentally fell to his death.
</li><li> The ending for Captain Rogers, the driver of Warthog, in the second game is a case of semantics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rogers wants to be young again, and when he wins the tournament he asks Calypso to give him the body of a twenty-year-old. One would assume that the <em>head</em> is included when one says "body", but Calypso doesn't.</span>
</li><li> In the second game, Amanda Watts, the driver of Twister, wishes to be able to go at the speed of light. Calypso tunes her car so that it can do that, and she winds up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaking the laws of physics and traveling back in time, eventually running out of gas in the prehistoric era and getting stomped on by a dinosaur</span>. Her sister Miranda in <em>Head-On</em> wishes that she can find her, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">comes back as a zombie</a></span>.
</li><li> In <em>2</em>, Mr. Grimm wishes for people to die faster so he can feed on their souls. Calypso does just that, causing people all over the world to fight and kill one another so Mr. Grimm could feast...at least until humanity went extinct, and he was left jonesing again.
</li><li> Also in <em>2</em>, Bruce Cochran, the driver of Thumper, wishes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. Calypso grants him that very wish...too bad humanity was driven to extinction by the Twisted Metal contest, leaving Cochran to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">Go Mad from the Isolation</a>, futilely screaming commands to the piles of corpses that constituted his "subjects".
</li><li> In <em>Black</em>, Agent Stone, the driver of Outlaw, wants to go back in time and spare an innocent family he accidentally killed while staking out a terrorist cell. He gets to go back, and he makes absolutely sure to only shoot the terrorists. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Only he's not thorough enough, and one of them pops back up and shoots him in the head, killing him.</span>
</li><li> Also in <em>Black</em>, the Preacher, the driver of Brimstone, has been possessed by a demon after performing an exorcism, and it causes him all kinds of mental anguish. Calypso promises to take away the demon if he wins. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Only Calypso takes away the demon by informing Preacher that the demon was never real in the first place, and he's actually severely mentally ill. Preacher decides the only way to be free of the torment in his mind is to kill himself.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Black</em>, Needles Kane, the driver of Sweet Tooth, is a serial killer who's caught and given the chair. However, Preacher shows up at his execution and curses him, which results in the flames on his head that he can never be rid of. Calypso promises to get rid of the curse if he wins. Calypso delivers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but he says the curse will return if Needles ever kills anyone. Needles decides he likes killing too much to give it up and that he'd rather live with the flames. His first new victim is Calypso himself</span>.
</li><li> Needles' wish in the 2012 game is to find his daughter Sophie Kane, who stabbed him in his left eye and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">the only person to have ever survived an encounter with him</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He ends up getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">teleported into her casket</a>. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">shot herself</a> ten years prior, as you would expect from someone who witnessed their serial killer father murder their family.</span> In the original draft, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finds Sophie, in this version not related to him and who has become a serial killer like him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InLoveWithYourCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InLoveWithYourCarnage">he falls in love with her</a> right before she decapitates him with a pair of hedge clippers and uses his flaming head as a torch to hunt more civilians</span>.
</li><li> 2012 Mr. Grimm wishes to go back in time to before his father died doing a stunt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's teleported into his father's truck and causes him to crash, then is shot to death by his younger self, condemning him to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.</span> In the first draft, he wishes to be able to successfully pull off the stunt that killed his father and is given a spectral bike to do exactly that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The bike makes the jump, but Mr. Grimm doesn't and falls to his death.</span> In the second draft, he wishes to see his father again, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and finds himself in his truck with the latter's 20-year-old corpse at the wheel before it drives them into a truck driven by Calypso</span>.
</li><li> 2012 Dollface's wish is to be on the world's largest runway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She's teleported onto an airstrip and run over by a plane.</span> In the first draft, she wishes to have her mask removed like her <em>Black</em> counterpart, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but is horrified by her own reflection, puts her mask back on, and is also run over</span>. In the third draft, she gets the mask removed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but her face now looks like it and she goes on a spree of murdering supermodels out of rage</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> And finally, there are those characters who recognize that Calypso is a Jackass Genie, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">react accordingly</a>. The drivers of Darkside in the first game and Minion in the second are demons who are there to straight-up take their powers back from Calypso, the latter throwing him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> for good measure, while Mr. Grimm in the first game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> seeking to claim Calypso's soul. The drivers of Pit Viper in the first game, Grasshopper in the second, Quatro and Meter Maid in the fourth, Manslaughter in <em>Black</em>, Crimson Fury, Outlaw, Shadow, and Warthog in <em>Small Brawl</em>, and Crimson Fury and Outlaw in <em>Head-On</em> all enter in order to kill, arrest, or otherwise punish Calypso, and save for Outlaw and Warthog in <em>Small Brawl</em> and Outlaw in <em>Head-On</em>, they get exactly what they want. Sweet Tooth also manages to kill Calypso twice, once in <em>Black</em> and again in <em>Head-On</em>. Calypso himself does this in the fourth game, where Needles Kane has stolen his power and he enters the contest to take it back.

<ul><li> In "Torg Potter and the Chamberpot of Secretions", the Djinn of the Chamberpot interprets <em>every single wish</em> someone makes as asking to be turned into a chocolate statue. The first two times it happens it's more a case of being a Literal Genie ("Could you make me some chocolate?" and "Make me irresistible to women"), but the third time, no one even really makes a wish, they just shout "Oh good bloody hell!" The genie claims this is Viking for "Turn me into chocolate." When it's pointed out that the Vikings didn't <em>have</em> chocolate, he retorts, "But if they <em>did</em> they would have called it 'bloodyhell'." <br/><br/>Incidentally, the reason this all is in the story is to parody the implausibility of how in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">the original</a>, a series of coincidences led to no-one ever being killed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the basilisk, even though just looking into its eyes was lethal. Time after time, the witness would happen to only see it in a mirror or similar, so rather than being killed outright, they would turn to stone instead, which could be safely reversed</span>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Torg:</strong> <em>Wait</em> a minute. You're saying all three guys just happened to wish something that had the same random result? <br/><strong>Genie:</strong> Yeah, pretty freaky, huh? <br/><strong>Torg:</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">That's freaking ridiculous!</a></em>
</div></li><li> In "That Which Redeems", there's a non-magical example that also confusingly combines it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> (as in, a Literal Genie understanding it's asked to act as a Jackass Genie). Lord Horribus asks Riff (the Dimension of Lame version) to build him "something terrible", and it's only after several catastrophic attempts that he realizes Riff's inventions have not been working because he took it to mean "something that works terrible".
</li><li> And later, there are the demons Zefolas and Fezeel, who trick mortals to sell their souls for wishes. The first wish is always free, but the second will cost you... <em><strong>YOUR SOUL</strong></em>. You can imagine what the wishes they grant are like, especially the first wishes when they want you to make a second. They even like to grant wishes and make deals in their own realm, where they are almost omnipotent and can ignore any wish they like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wishplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wishplosion">that might harm them</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem">simply for sport</a>. This allows them to take being Jackass Genies to the extreme since they don't even have to limit themselves to twisting wishes asked for if it's not convenient. The only way to beat them turns out to be to ask for wishes that they don't realize can be used against them.

Anyone who accepts (or requests something else) gets their request granted, but incurs an equal amount of misery as the price. On the plus side, it's at least nice enough to specify the price it demands, allowing the person to choose for themselves whether this is what they want or not. The wishes themselves are granted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">literally</a>.

However, every time that person makes a wish, it comes out wrong, or the genie deliberately jacks around with it: for instance, when asked for a sandwich, it made it — and then ate it. When asked for a winning lottery ticket, it made a <em>losing</em> lottery ticket. It doesn't seem interested in their requests, and often ignores them outright and goes on to reply that he didn't hear you or that you said nothing at all. Mostly, all this seems to be due to it having a serious drug habit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apparently, this is all due to it having once been at the opposite end of this trope, as a human once wished for the genie to a) be an alcoholic drug addict and b) for it to be impossible to unwish the first wish, ruining the genie's life out of apparently pure dickery.</span>

Maxo accepts the offer, thinking it might come in handy at some point. Much later, Maxo wants to resurrect one of his friends, and the demon uses that to sneak out of his prison dimension in the guise of that resurrected friend.

Again, when Timmy wishes that "Trixie Tang [his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>] loves Timmy Turner," he goes so far as to include the names to prevent this trope. As a result, his love interest is now in love with everyone <em>else</em> in the world named "Timmy Turner". Later on, though, he proves his status as a Jerkass by granting Timmy's wish for a million dollars by having Timmy's Dad <em>counterfeit</em> the money and be on the run from the cops as a result. Curiously, when Timmy wishes he had a lawyer, Norm (inadvertently?) summons up one who's highly competent and succeeds in undoing the damage Norm has caused, rather than following his normal tendencies and giving Timmy an incompetent lawyer. Norm looked really confused when he grants the lawyer wish, so it's likely that his confusion results in him not really thinking about the wish, thus causing him to summon a competent lawyer.
</li><li> Within a time period of "fifteen legal minutes", the lawyer words a wish in a way that'll undo the harms caused by the second and the third wishes and release Cosmo and Wanda but Norm still finds two ways to screw Timmy: when Timmy's Dad is taken back home from jail, his cellmate goes with him; and Trixie stops wanting to kiss everyone named "Timmy Turner" right when she's about to kiss him.
</li><li> When Crocker gets a hold of Norm, he wishes for a series of absurdly impractical deathtraps for Timmy, prompting Norm to <em>act</em> somewhat benevolent but only to suggest that Crocker is not evil <em>enough</em> and that "Mars is really nice this time of year." When Timmy defeats Crocker and asks Norm to send him to Mars, he's so delighted to have his suggestion taken that he provides Timmy with a spacesuit to enjoy seeing Crocker act out the ending of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall</a></em>. In a way though, Norm still acts this trope, <em>because</em> the wish involves someone getting hurt, which makes it easy for him. In general, it seems that the wishes Norm grants are jerkass in nature; even if the user is on the same page as him, he just cant help it if his wishes happen to backfire.
</li></ul></li><li> A weird variation of this is the apprentice wizard Fuddie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters">Filmation's Ghostbusters</a></em>, who can grant Jake a wish on the night of every full moon. While he is sincerely trying to help, he seems to be hard of hearing, and <em>always</em> gets the wish wrong. (For example, Jake wished to be "invincible", but Fuddie made him invisible instead. (In fact, Fuddie seems to mess up a lot doing other things too.) Fortunately, the heroes can usually make do with what he gives them anyway.
</li><li> There was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxAndDaveFleischer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxAndDaveFleischer">Fleischer</a> cartoon where an old man catches a leprechaun and forces it to take him to its pot of gold, which it does. The gold is buried under a tree stump, so the man hangs his coat on the stump and instructs the leprechaun not to move the coat or alter the stump in any way while he gets a shovel. When he returns, the leprechaun has obeyed his orders, and the stump is undisturbed. However, the leprechaun has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">added a few dozen identical stumps to the area</a>. The old guy promptly dies of shock, probably to keep the writers from explaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">why he couldn't just dig up</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">all</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">the stumps</a>.

Of course, the leprechaun simply has someone else duplicate his marker. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>, however, in that the correct stump is booby-trapped.

Garfield gets his own back by making a wish that causes the Godfather's wife to show up. She was aggressive enough to make him leave.

After Odie finds a bottle with a genie in it at the beach, Jon does some research and discovers that while some genies are good, some are also bad. Garfield frees the genie (named Omar) and as expected, he is a bad genie, and he demands that <em>Jon</em> grant <em>him</em> three wishes. When he has one wish left, he uses it to get unlimited wishes. When Jon fails to comply, he is turned into a frog. Thankfully, Garfield discovers that to defeat the genie, he has to get him to say his own name backward.

Puck — the trickster fairy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidsummerNightsDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidsummerNightsDream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em> — is captured by Demona and forced to do her bidding. Puck, either out of a sense of mischief, annoyance with being enslaved, or a sincere desire to avoid harming others — possibly all three — deliberately misconstrues Demona's wishes, as follows...
<div class="indent"><strong>Demona:</strong> If you can't get rid of <em>all</em> the humans, then at least rid me of that Human! <em>Elisa Maza!</em> <br/><strong>Puck:</strong> Did you say "<em>that</em> Human" or "that <em>Human</em>"? Oh, never mind, I'll figure it out. This just might be fun, after all.
</div><ul><li> Rather than destroy Elisa, Puck uses his powers to turn her into a gargoyle. Thus, as he puts it "The <em>Human</em> Elisa Maza is no more." Demona, still not getting the drift, then makes him do it to the entire population of Manhattan. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. Puck did say that the Mirror that was used to summon him wasn't Aladdin's lamp, implying even if he wasn't being a trickster, he couldn't kill all the humans as Demona wanted.
</li><li> And at the end of the episode, Demona wishes to be able to stay awake during the daylight hours <em>and</em> the night. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Puck makes it so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorMeBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorMeBlack">she turns into a human during the day</a>.</span> How she actually <em>survives</em> like this, rather than collapsing in exhaustion after a few days, is never mentioned in-series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">"She does have to sleep now, though she gets by on a few hours per day.</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=389">Doesn't really improve her mental outlook if you know what I mean."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Mindy ends up strapped to an exploding rocket to "Be a big star." Pud'n is left to an unspecified but probably gory fate at the hands of a pet rabbit.
