</p><p>...yes, of course, the technology has a bizarre effect that nobody could have predicted  you really need to keep track of those inputs and outputs! Usually it's in the form of acquiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">sentience</a> or a bizarre weapon, or only being able to be used by people of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">target demographic</a>. (It's common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> series.)
</p><p>This is surprisingly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, particularly in programming, where the programmer is the only one who really understands how what they've built works (and sometimes, not even <em>them</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0x8fm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0x8fm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0x8fm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even a "simple" (no graphics, purely command-line and input file driven and with the only output being more text files) scientific application that does anything actually useful can easily exceed ten thousand lines of code in a high-level language and is probably the result of the work of multiple people, none of whom knows <em>every</em> detail of the parts they didn't write. And even if a single dedicated programmer wrote the whole thing personally, it's virtually certain that at least some of it uses infrastructure in the form of library routines or system calls that were not written by the same programmer.</span>). Especially in high-level languages, where the programmer can for example tell the computer to replace all occurrences of "cake" with "apple" in a text, and doesn't have to worry about how the system does it - they get a changed text back and that's that. This also happens in pharmacology, where it might be discovered that a drug has a positive effect on people with a certain illness but when it's first used doctors and scientists don't understand why.

<ul><li> A particularly amusing example from pharmaceutical advertising (emphasis added): "Fibromyalgia <em>is thought to be</em> the result of overactive nerves. Lyrica <em>is believed to</em> calm these nerves." In other words, we don't really know how our drug works or even what your disease is, but please buy it anyway!

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> franchise, CyberConnect Corporation treats <em>The World</em> as the game it appears to be, but those who can find the so-called "Creator's Rooms" can discern some of the original designer's true intent.
<ul><li> And the game keeps sucking up player's, programmer's, and administrator's minds; even after they've rewritten it twice. Even so, that's much safer than the alpha version. Many were terrified of even playtesting it, particularly after its creator <em>died</em> playtesting it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually, Harald didn't die, but his mind was absorbed into the program completely.</span>
</li><li> The core code of <em>The World</em> is explicitly referred to as a "Black Box" in several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the novels</a>.
</li><li> There are also occasions where the game circumvents or thwarts the administrators' attempts to fix issues, such as banning certain players, as well as spawn vagrant AIs.
<ul><li> Not helping things is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the thing was designed as an AI incubator by using the player's mind as a large sampling of intelligent thought.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The development of the Evangelions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> is very much along the lines of this trope, although the source of the Black Box is not earthly.
<ul><li> The S2 engine is a particularly fitting example. American attempts to reverse engineer the device result in a massive disaster - the test engine <em>vanishes</em>, along with the entire research facility and all other objects in a 50-mile radius.
</li><li> Also, the Lance of Longinus. We have no idea what it is, but dang does it tear Angels up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The replicas are decidedly less effective.</span>
</li><li> Not helped by the fact that nearly all of the information concerning the Angels is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>. Long story short, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adam and Lilith are two types of "Seeds" meant to be progenitors of life on new worlds created by a long dead Precursor race. The Lances are simply control rods that seal Seeds if they land on planets that already have Seeds, since conflict between the two different types of Seeds would cause a cataclysmic event (Impact) that reduces all life back to its primordial state. The Dead Sea Scrolls explain <em>everything</em> in detail to make sure that no one removes a Lance by mistake. The Precursors didn't expect that anyone would be crazy/stupid enough to <em>want</em> Impact to occur.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">plants</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> can do pretty much anything depending on how you power them, but nobody's really sure how they run anymore. (The manga actually calls them "humanity's ultimate black box".)
</li><li> The flying machines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun">Simoun</a></em> have two black boxes: the "Helical motor" (according to the sub) and the "Simoun Gem". Trying to find out how these things work apparently drives you mad for a little while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>: The SDF-1 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> is riddled with black boxes, often causing bits of advanced alien tech to do things that the humans never expected them to do. By the time of the later series in the franchise, humanity has reverse-engineered most of the <em>Macross</em>'s technology and can fully control it.
</li><li> Black Boxes are a dime a dozen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>, ranging from nigh-indestructible giant robots to androids to underground tunnel networks. The last episode reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <em>plane of existence</em> is one big Black Box. The only comprehensible objects in the series are tomatoes, and <em>those</em> are a type of mysterious lost technology</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">Nanomachines</a> powering the Otomes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>. Frankly, what kind of perverted scientist thought it would be a good idea to have them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown">break down</a> upon any contact with male DNA, thus requiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast">exclusively female virgins</a> to operate it under the shaky hope they aren't depowered? One that would be too threatened by the notion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">wives who are stronger than them</a>, most likely. It's all but stated outright that the Otome were based on the HiME, the "natural" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">magical girls</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>. So it's a Black Box replicating magic. It's a damn miracle it works at all.
</li><li> The Clow Cards in the first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>. The cards are sentient, though most are astonishingly specialized, and their creator is dead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but returns anyway in the form of his reincarnation in the second arc.</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids">Zoids</a></em>. The Ultimate X zoids are shown to have a "black box" that other zoids do not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> mentions this. In one flashback, they actually discuss a strange interface on Galeon, an alien mecha lion, and refer to it as a Black Box. Once they figure out how to activate it, it contains designs for half the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> in the show.
</li><li> In the Nausicaa manga, the Crypts of Shuwa are <em>full</em> of Black Boxes—most notably the God Warrior. More mundanely, nobody has the technology to build new airship engines any more, so when an airship is downed, there's a scramble to salvage the irreplaceable engines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a>!</em> has a bunch of them, collectively called 'Black Technology', created by the mysterious 'Whispered'. Many are simply extrapolations of existing technologies, which are mass-produced and change the world drastically - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Whispered are explicitly NOT useless.</a> Others, however, are perfect examples of the trope - Foremost among them is the 'Lambda Driver', a true Black Box which enables users to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">warp the laws of physics through sheer determination</a>.
<ul><li> In <em>The Second Raid</em> it's mentioned that the Arbelest is optimised for the first person who used it (Sousuke) and as the designer died since then that means it can't be reset for another user.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata">Legacy of the Aldenata</a></em> series features a number of examples of the Black Box. The alien Posleen (or "people of the ships" in their language) are similar to the Covenant in Halo in that they use technology they understand poorly if at all. A perfect example of this is one of their commanders staring in confusion at a computer helpfully informing him "Incoming ballistic projectiles. Impact in 10 seconds. Five.... etc" The views of their society in the initial books of the series are vague for the most part but imply that they only really use the systems that kill things or are almost entirely automated. A literal black box used by the humans in the same series appears in the form of the AID which is a black memory plastic box about the size of a pack of cigarettes with an extremely potent AI embedded in it. They act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalTranslator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalTranslator">Universal Translator</a> as well, but are provided by another species and the humans haven't a clue how they really work or how to make them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turns out to be a serious problem for a number of reasons</span>

It was given to them by the friendly aliens at the end of the first book, who had found it on some other planet and had no idea what it was for. Although they did warn that one should NOT apply a "significant voltage" to it. Hooking up a double-A battery leaves a 10-mile crater.

Unfortunately, most people who end up there lack any technical background, so any engineer who finds his or her way to the Platform is is paid handsomely to try to figure out how to even work the systems, much less reverse-engineer them. The engineers also have a fairly high fatality rate due to the fact that they have really no idea what they're doing. Sure, the ships left by the mysterious aliens have fairly basic analog controls (dumbed down for an average human), but it took at least a year to figure out that there are toilets aboard. It took about as long to figure out how to flush one without depressurizing the whole ship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The aliens are giving bits and pieces of their tech to their human contacts on Earth, allowing their contacts to get filthy rich off the patents</span>.

When the protagonist asks the shuttle's commander if it's possible to study and replicate this tech on Earth, the commander grimly replies that it is... in about a hundred years. At current human tech levels, all alien tech fits this trope. Despite this, even this addition is a strict violation of the Conclave's rule prohibiting Weaker races from sharing technology.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Russian <em>Death Zone</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a>, the mechanical artifacts found in the Five Zones usually fit this trope.

This doesn't stop many people, groups, and outside corporations from studying them. Stalkers have also figured out how to use some of the equipment in their daily lives, but they still have no idea how it works.
</li><li> In Dave Barnett's <em>Gideon Smith</em> novels, the British eventually control the mechanical brass dragon, Apep. Apep, despite being made in ancient Egypt during Akneheten's reign, is beyond the ability of a late 19th century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> Britain. The British would dearly love to copy Apep but can't because of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> used in its construction. British scientists have tested Apep and the mechanical doll bound to it, so they know that Apep can fly at 100 miles per hour (and possibly faster than that) and it has an unlimited supply of fireballs that are 1949 Celsius in temperature and these never lose any intensity of heat until they hit a target. However their studies show that the clockwork mechanisms making up Apep, should not have been able to work and they have no idea where Apep's fireballs come from. The only thing they know is that it takes a number of magical artifacts to use Apep.
</li><li> The reason why Harry Potter was easily distracted in class was so magic would become this for the reader. The exact specifics of how Magic works is not always that well explained in the course of seven books. It just does. There clearly is some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> invoked, as what few rules we do learn are consistent, but we do not know why these rules exist.

Legend has it that they were created by the Grim Reaper himself and gifted to three brothers. Dumbledore speculates that it's more likely that said brothers were just prodigiously talented magical craftsmen. Whatever the case, no one has been able to replicate their three masterworks.

They are cheap, easy to build using basic electronic components and powered by a potato. And nobody can figure out how they work.

Most people use it like GTA, while teenagers use it to engage in orgies and drug use without harm, although a few are devoted to unlocking its mysteries. The one rule to play is that you only get one life, and are immediately and permanently locked out if you die. Its origins, and the reasons for its existence, are a complete mystery to everyone. Even the creator of the V-World technology has no idea who built it or why. The hardcore gamers all insist that there must be some reason or point to it, and are obsessed with the idea of "beating" the game, even though it doesn't seem to work that way. Eventually the point is rendered moot when the protagonist reshapes the whole world into a forest fantasy kingdom full of dragons. Really.

</li><li> Finch and his partner invoke this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> when questioned by the CIA on how the Machine provides intel (it takes in raw electronic surveillance data and spits out a person's social security number to lead the user to a threat). Finch feels the Machine is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManShouldHaveThisPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManShouldHaveThisPower">too powerful for any person to have access</a>, and so encrypts it so heavily even he will never be able to access it again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> often adapts lesser versions of the technology the crew encounters from other planets. "It doesn't quite work like the original" is commonly stated. However, they're far more aware than most Black Box users of the potential for unexpected side effects.
<ul><li> In fact, nearly every piece of technology they pick up is mentioned to be sent off to Area 51, either in the episode where it's introduced, or when they decide to use it again. This leads to situations that look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">Forgotten Phlebotinum</a>, until two or three years down the line where the device pops up again. Except for anything that comes with a trigger (Zat guns, anyone?) which is usually put into active service immediately. Which should come as a surprise to nobody, since military usage (including stuff that makes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>) is usually the first application mankind can think off for any given tech. Naquadria bombs, anyone?
<ul><li> Which makes sense in a way, as acquiring weapons to defend Earth is the SGC's first mission.
</li></ul></li><li> There are few ideas that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">missing</a> however. So they can take apart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">staff weapons</a> but can't build them or speed up rate of fire but could find them by the buttload after a firefight right? Well, seeing as how that whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">unlimited ammo for machine guns</a> thing would be <em>very</em> useful in their fighters, why didn't they strap six or seven of the firing portion onto a rotating contraption and make an impromptu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">gatling weapon</a> and mount one of those?
<ul><li> It was mentioned in show, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">kinetic weapons</a> make better infantry weapons because staff weapons are self-cauterizing and less accurate. As for space weapons, they probably never actually captured a ship class staff weapon. The infantry ones they have are much less powerful the the F-302 railguns.
</li><li> While never utilized in the show, that idea is one of the first uses Humanity finds for all the extra Staff Weapons in the fanfic series '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/XSGCOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/XSGCOM">XSGCOM</a>', among other things...
</li></ul></li><li> This also extends to the spinoff/sequels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>, where the protagonists uncover treasure troves of Ancient and alien technology. Though they know how to operate the Ancient technology they find (most of the time), they don't know their exact inner workings.
</li><li> The Goa'uld, on the other hand, make very little effort to study the Ancient technology they use. They've based their empire on things like the Stargates and ring transporters, but they really have no idea how any of it works.
<ul><li> Most Goa'uld are like this, but a few tech-savvy ones do try to make new tech. Clear examples are Anubis (although he's just reverse-engineering Ancient tech) and Ba'al (who understands the programming used by the gate system on a deep level and has messed around with gravity manipulation). In fact, it's the bigshot System Lords who usually don't bother with the tech stuff, but there are many underling Goa'uld who serve as their technical specialists. It's not that they don't know how Ancient-derived tech works, they just don't see the point in trying to improve it if it will upset the status quo.
</li></ul></li><li> When first encountering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransplantedHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransplantedHumans">Tollan</a>, Carter states that their tech lacks any moving parts, wires, or anything else recognizable to modern science. This, effectively, makes their tech unreproducable on Earth. It's possible they deliberately engineered their tech in this manner to keep the Goa'uld from making use of it. Then again, the Tau'ri haven't really had a chance to study a lot of Tollan tech, since they refuse to hand it over, and them being allies kinda prevents the Tau'ri from taking it by force or stealing. The one time they offer one of their ion cannons, Carter studies the plans and determines that it's impossible to reproduce for another century or so.
</li><li> The titular Stargate ITSELF is a black box. It was built by the Ancients. They have figured out how to hook computers and power up to it and send signals to it. But the Stargate itself is way beyond human tech.
</li></ul></li><li> The positronic brain that makes Data a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Robot</a> serves as his black box in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>. While Starfleet has a pretty good idea of how the rest of his body works, the technology that actually makes him sentient is a complete mystery to them, especially since the genius inventor who built him is dead. They're understandably reluctant to take Data apart to figure it out, since they don't know if they'd be able to put him back together afterwards, and after a particularly overzealous researcher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">took the issue to court</a>, Data gained the legal right to refuse such a dismantling anyway. His own attempt to replicate the technology seemed to succeed when he built a "daughter", Lal, but her positronic brain became unstable and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">only lived for a few weeks</a>. Nobody's tried to build another one since.
<ul><li> Also, the risk of creating another Lore (Data's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">dangerously flawed older brother</a>) highlights the risks of building anything less than a flawless brain on the first attempt.

<ul><li> A fair bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is considered black-box level of complexity, usable by the Inner Sphere but completely beyond their understanding in regards to <em>how</em> it worked due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">300 years of total war</a> destroying means of production and conspiracies to assassinate scientists. This includes things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip">Drop Ship</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Jumpship</a> construction technology (described as fully automated and unable to be built), human myomer implantation (with horrific results if it fails for reasons unknown), and faster-than-light 'secret transmission' technology, which sends faxes across the stars. One of the most famed in-universe black boxes was the New Avalon Valkyrie factory, a fully-automated facility that kept producing brand new, function Battlemechs for centuries after it was turned on: raw materials went in one end, Valkyries came out the other. The New Avalon Institute of Science wanted to try taking the factory apart to see if they could replicate it or switch it over to produce a more powerful Battlemech, but fears that they wouldn't be able to put it back together afterword kept them from doing so. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot">timeline has progressed, however</a>, there have been some gains in the understanding of such technology.
</li><li> Quoth the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlissStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlissStage">Bliss Stage</a>: Ignition Stage</em> rulebook: "In the center of every ANIMa creche lies a scavenged piece of an alien's brain. It's possible that this is the only thing that an ANIMa requires to function, and that the rest of the machine is there to inspire more confidence on the part of the pilots."
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CthulhuTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CthulhuTech">CthulhuTech</a></em>. Since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Dimensional Engine</a> runs on non-Euclidean mathematics, attempting to find out what goes on inside one will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">cause weak minds to break</a>.
<ul><li> The term non-Euclidean here is meant to be a hint of how complex and hard or impossible to understand this geometry is, rather than a strict description. According to one article, 4D geometry isn't Euclidean because there's an easy way for corners to mathematically become curves. We're familiar with geometry that works with respect to spheres, because trying to travel in a large enough square path will not result in getting to the original place. That's a standard example of non-Euclidean geometry. Imagine going to a realm where backtracking would <em>also</em> take you to a different place. Or traveling in distances that cannot be expressed only in real numbers, so imaginary numbers must also be used. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mad Science in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> is a prominent example. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> may create fantastic devices that surpass anything "regular" science is able to produce, but it's impossible to mass-produce Mad Science gizmoes - they just don't work. Throughout the centuries, Mad Science gains or loses popularity, depending on the shifting popular opinion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mad Science is partly magical, the ideas for it coming from Manitous, malevolent spirits serving the setting's Big Bads. It is part of a master plot to (eventually) bring about Ghost Rock bombs, nuclear weapons capable of warping or killing spirits of living things, and to transform the entire Earth into a terror-filled wasteland.</span>
<ul><li> The devices become more reliable with the shift from mad science to "patent science" in <em>Deadlands Noir</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> campaign setting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> has two:
<ul><li> Black box magic was used to develop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">warforged</a> through schemas, which are essentially magical blueprints conveniently left behind by an ancient giant civilization. It turns out (in the <em>Secrets of Xen'drik</em> supplement) that it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an attempt by an ancient extradimensional race to escape to our world from the realm of dreams by creating artificial bodies</span>, though this doesn't explain why modern warforged are fully sentient and appear to have souls (it does explain why the bodies can easily contain souls, but considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the aforementioned extradimensional race is active on another continent and using specially bred mostly-humans for on-demand possession</span> exactly where their souls are coming from is another question...).
</li><li> In a sort of meta-example, divine magic (the sort of magic used by Cleric spells) in Eberron works on a "clap your hands if you believe" basis. Unlike in other settings, even high level Clerics cannot communicate directly with their gods; when they try to do so, at best they get an entity that claims to be a high-level servant of the god rather than the god itself. The setting is <em>extremely</em> coy with respect to whether or not any gods actually exist, and if so, <em>which ones</em>. Even the beings reached with, say, a <em>Commune</em> spell will, if pressed, hang a lampshade on this, saying of <em>course</em> they haven't <em>personally</em> seen or talked to the gods, but they <em>must</em> exist, because praying to them works, doesn't it? Divine magic works even for the Clerics of one particular cult who <em>know for a fact</em> that their god does not exist (yet), because they're working on <em>building</em> it.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>. Many of the great and wondrous artifacts <em>can</em> be understood... it's just that most of the great designers would have been among the Solar Exalted, who were murdered and had their Exaltations sealed away so they couldn't reincarnate. It doesn't help that the Solars specifically designed many artifacts to only function for Solars... because they never imagined there would be a time when they weren't around.
<ul><li> In theory, any Celestial Exalt (or Terrestrial of sufficient age and experience) could bring themselves to understand the complex workings of Solar artifice. The problem is that reaching that level of excellence is much harder for non-Solars, they can't achieve nearly the same level of speed, and besides they've been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gotterdammerung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gotterdammerung">a bit</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">distracted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">since</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed">then.</a>
</li><li> Well, now that the Solar Exalted are back, they can begin reverse engineering all of the old First Age tech... as can their corrupted cousins, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Abyssal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Exalted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Infernal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">Exalted,</a> whose bosses have other ideas about what to do with all of that technology.
</li><li> To a degree, Exaltations themselves are black boxes, to the point where the guy who <em>made</em> the Celestial-tier shards probably can't make any more<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19mmq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19mmq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19mmq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">partly because he's comatose and dying of robot-cancer</span>. The main alterations made have been the result of insane supergods launching curses fuelled by the power of their own deaths (the Great Curse), the random action of a zone of infinite probability (the breaking of the Lunar castes), flipping a switch that may have been there all along (Abyssals), and using an intact Solar shard as the battery pack for a web of Yozi Essence (Infernals). Alchemicals can only be made by demiurges channelling the Design of Autochthon and have no idea how to make more when not channelling. About the only Exalts it's easy to make are Dragon-Bloods, and that's because all you need is two other Dragon-Bloods, one male and one female. Or not even that, since anyone with a Dragon-Blood ancestor can Exalt as a Dragon-Blood as long as they haven't Exalted as anything else, though it's less likely.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em> are mostly this, devices that for a number of reasons got enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">Ragnarök Proofing</a> to function thousands or even millions of years after having been created and the civilizations that made them fell... but not only are they so advanced that the setting treats them like magic, but they also didn't have <em>enough</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">Ragnarök Proofing</a> to survive being used more than once after being unearthed—and because of said civilizations falling so long ago, the full knowledge of what they can do (let alone how to repair them) just doesn't exist anymore.
</li><li> Syrneth artifacts in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em> RPG setting are an intentional use of this trope. Syrneth technology doesn't just do whatever is convenient; the results of humans tinkering with it can have effects ranging from miraculous to horrendous, and sometimes no effect at all.
<ul><li> Syrneth artifacts also run the gamut in regards to the complexity of their function. The <em>Pirate Nations</em> sourcebook includes several that players can purchase. They include a completely functional cybernetic hand and a marble that, once tapped, will always roll back to the position it was last tapped, showcasing how bizarre some of the effects can be.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Space1889" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Space1889">Space 1889</a></em> there are plenty of such phenomena where you know the input and the output but how no idea how it is achieved in Space 1889. It is not only the fictional Martian left-over technology from long ago but plenty of things we now know how it works that were a mystery to historical Victorians. For instance the sun seems to send out a lot of energy from nowhere, much more than any known type of fuel could possibly sustain for more very long leading some people to believe the solar system cannot be more than a few thousands year old. You seem to inherit traits from your parents, but having no idea of DNA, the mechanism for this is a mystery to Victorians who sometimes think it is somehow literally "in the blood" or "with the mother's milk," but that makes it hard to explain how plants can inherit traits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The modern Imperium of Man is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a> that has lost a great deal of technological knowledge over the millennia, and as a result many of the devices lovingly-maintained by the rituals of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineCult">Adeptus Mechanicus</a> are irreplaceable ancient relics. One example would be the Gauntlets of Ultramar, a paired set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">power fists</a> with integrated boltguns that is a treasured relic of the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines. The Adeptus Mechanicus would love to study the Gauntlets, but since that would mean disassembling and possibly forgetting how to reassemble the weapons, the Ultramarines have "declined" the Mechanicus' requests to examine them, emphatically and repeatedly.
</li><li> The "gene-seed" that transforms a normal human into a Space Marine is derived from the genetic material of the twenty Primarchs, who were created by the Emperor of Mankind to lead his Great Crusade to reconquer the galaxy. Since the Emperor is currently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport">a skeletal husk sustained by the Golden Throne</a>, and the Primarchs are all either dead, lost, fallen to Chaos, or otherwise in no condition to contribute, it's impossible to create "fresh" gene-seed. Instead, each Space Marine sports a pair of "progenoid" organs that can grow germ forms of all the other implants, which are cultivated by a chapter's Apothecaries to use in the next generation of recruits. This means one of an Apothecary's most important duties is securing the corpses of fallen battle-brothers and extracting those progenoid glands before they are lost to the enemy, and Space Marine chapters who run low on gene-seed, through battlefield losses or mutation, are in danger of dying out entirely.
</li><li> A nonhuman example would be the Blackstone Fortresses of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic">Gothic Sector</a>, a sextet of ancient space structures that were appropriated by the Imperium. The AdMech were able to patch into the stations' power systems and hook up their own weapons and life-support, but nobody was sure of the things' function... until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">Abaddon the Despoiler</a> showed up with some artifacts of his own and fully activated the Blackstone Fortresses, deploying guns that tore holes in space-time and could make suns go nova. Turns out they were created by the Eldar's forge gods as a means to harness Warp energy to destroy the C'tan.
</li><li> To humans, Tau technology is this. The Adeptus Mechanicus believes that each device has a "machine spirit" that must be placated with chanting and sanctified engine oil before it will function, so watching an alien walk up to something and just flip the "on" switch is bizarre and blasphemous.

It was very obviously not meant to be intelligible to anyone whose name isn't Ken Silverman.

Not only is Toady One <em>very</em> protective of the source code behind his masterwork, but his software development skills are almost entirely self-taught. The handful of people who have been entrusted with backup copies of it have attested that the code is almost impenetrable to mere mortals.
<ul><li> Really, this can apply to just about anything a player creates in the game. Fortresses can get so elaborate that critical functions are simply forgotten or change completely as they are built upon; this <em>especially</em> applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionGame">Succession Games</a>, since players tend to not use the in-game labelling function. Many a fortress has run into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">fun</a> because the guy running it forgets which lever opens the door to the mess hall and which one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">activates the fortress' lava-based self-destruct</a>.

The most common example is "Dwarven metal" which is an unique alloy that resembles bronze but never dulls or corrodes. Nobody by the time the game takes place knows how to create it since the Dwemer have vanished, so smelting it essentially involves recycling pieces of their scrap metal.

You can't reverse-engineer the tech, but, by the end-game, you can build ships that are <em>better</em>.
<ul><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">manual</a>, the Arceans intended humans to fall into this trap when making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> via a sublight probe. They transmitted the plans for building a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">hyperspace gate</a>, deliberately modified by them to prevent humans from shutting the gate off, allowing the Arceans to invade Earth. Subverted, in that the humans said "hell no" and started trying to reverse-engineer the thing and figure out a way to make it better. They succeed by virtue of having developed fusion power and being able to minimize a "gate" into a portable hyperdrive. Then some idiot decides to send the plans to everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunner</a> technology is still considered this by the galaxy's current races, despite their best efforts to reverse-engineer it:
<ul><li> The series even has a rare example where the black box is in the aliens' hands; not only is almost all of Covenant's technology reverse-engineered from Forerunner relics, but a good percentage of their equipment is directly constructed by prehistoric Forerunner machinery, and some high-end Covenant ships even have Forerunner components directly installed. However, due to the Covenant worshipping the Forerunners as gods, even just trying to better understand Forerunner technology runs the risk of being seen as heresy. For this reason, the Covenant do not use even their own knock-off technology very efficiently, much less the Forerunner originals.
</li><li> Zig-zagged by humanity's understanding of Forerunner tech:
<ul><li> On one hand, they have a surprisingly good understanding of how the Covenant's knock-off versions work, and are often able to drastically improve captured Covenant technology, as demonstrated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>; for example, Cortana is able to convert a plasma torpedo launcher on a hijacked Covenant ship into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> by simply recalibrating its programming. That said, while they might know how Covie technology <em>works</em>, they still have trouble figuring out how it's <em>built</em>, meaning that even post-war humanity is still mostly reliant on ballistic weapons.
</li><li> On the other hand, proper Forerunner technology is still largely a mystery to them, despite the occasional reverse-engineering success. For example, humanity's post-war flagship <em>Infinity</em> has several Forerunner components installed, including its slipspace drive. However, not even the ship's chief scientist quite understands how said components actually work.
</li></ul></li><li> The Forerunners even created an entire species embodying this trope; the Huragok/Engineers are biological supercomputers who are incredibly adept with technology. However, despite being one of the nicest species in the entire galaxy, the Huragok are absolutely <em>terrible</em> at explaining their technological know-how to other species; the lore tidbit for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>'s Huragok-designed "King" visor states that humanity has almost no idea how to reproduce it, despite the fact that its inventor is under their employ.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Spartan Ops</a></em>, one frustrated human scientist describes the current state of his species' research on Forerunner technology as such:
<div class="indent">"We're turning on dormant technology we don't know the first thing about! We're like <em>monkeys</em>, hammering on a nuclear bomb because we like the sound it makes!"
</div></li><li> Then there's Precursor tech, which appears to lack any physical components at all and is rooted in <em>sentience itself</em>. Unfortunately, most of it was destroyed when the Halo rings were fired.
</li></ul></li><li> Deadliar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker">Hellsinker</a></em> previous nickname was Blackbox in true spirit of this this trope since noone had any idea how he operated and produced the results he did.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Historical and Technical Briefing</a> describes the discovery of a large amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> in the wreck of an ancient spacecraft, including something eventually identified as "a solid-state hyperspace induction module". It's implied that much of their limited understanding of how it actually works was gained from building a couple of scaled-down copies and fitting them to small spacecraft, pressing the 'on' button and watching to see what happened.
<ul><li> Then it turned out that said module is actually a 10,000-year old Progenitor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Far Jumper</a>; only three of them exist in the whole galaxy. One of these are in the posession of the Bentusi and it's the basis of all hyperdrives in the galaxy, save the Kushan ones. It is also said that no matter how much they study them, they can't figure out why the reverse-engineered versions are much slower than the originals even though they know how to make other ships tag along by "riding the quantum wavefront". In fact, combining the three Far Jumpers will <em>break the laws of physics</em> (black holes disable hyperdrives yet the Trinity still works flawlessly).
</li><li> The semi-canonical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> <em>Cataclysm</em> has a fourth hyperspace core, whose capabilities are on par with the Progenitor Far Jumpers (except it was built a <em>million years ago</em>), except that it came from another galaxy on an experimental exploration ship called the <em>Naggarok</em>. Besides the extremely-advanced hyperdrive, the ship also has inertialess sublight drives (allowing the massive craft to zip around the battlefield faster than any fighter), extremely-precise long-range ion cannons (able to swat fighters like gnats), and a powerful Phase Disassembler Array that can convert even a dreadnought into energy in a matter of seconds (said energy can then be used to build cruise missiles). While the ship is destroyed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> of the game, the tech inside it likely fits this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Epitaphs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteSpace">Infinite Space</a></em>. They're more-or-less useless one-foot-square rust-red and slime-green cubes, but if you can figure out what they do, you get rewarded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">the power to alter the universe.</a>

<ul><li> The Citadel and mass relays are thought to be built by the Protheans. Humans and other races use them, though their inner workings and construction are poorly understood, and any attempt <em>to</em> understand them is regarded as an exercise in futility. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a>, the Reapers, were the real builders of these wonders, and the Protheans were just barely figuring out the technology themselves when they were wiped out.</span>
</li><li> Worse than that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mass relays and Citadel are a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">trap</a> set by the Reapers meant to alert them when sentient life is ready for another round of reaping. Just before they begin their invasion, they disable the entire relay network so that all star systems are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">isolated from each other, and ripe for the picking.</a></span>
</li><li> But wait, it gets even worse than that! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the original plans for the series, as in before Mass Effect 3 was developed, the motive behind the Reapers was that the Mass Effect phenomenon, upon which all modern technology is predicated, has an entropic effect on the universe, causing stars to die more quickly and presumably hastening the inevitable, final heat death of existence. The Reapers were aware of it and were harvesting sentient species the moment they became intelligent enough that they could work on solutions, but before their societies become too detrimental.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Matriarch Aethyta</a> very much dislikes the black box nature of the relays and once proposed trying to study relays more intimately, maybe even building one. As she puts it, the other Matriarchs "laughed the blue off my ass."
</li><li> The design of their conventional FTL system is much the same, being almost entirely reverse-engineered from the Protheans. This means that they have no idea how to disengage certain safety protocols that prevent ships from being flown into planets or other vessels at relativistic velocities. While this is generally a good thing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it prevents the military from using this tactic against the Reapers</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">The third game</a> kicks this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Crucible, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture">light flung into the future</a> so many times that barely anyone who tried to build it understood what it was or what it did. Not even the Protheans were sure how it even <em>operated,</em> and they nearly finished the damn thing before the Reapers completed their invasion. It's hammered home numerous times through the game that it could do damn near anything because while there are easily understandable blueprints for it, there's no data on how to use it or what it does. At one point Commander Shepard likens the situation to a child playing with his father's gun. It turns out to be little more than a giant power source used to brute-force hack the Citadel and Relay network to either destroy or control all Reapers. It can alternatively forcibly convert all organic and machine life into cyborgs if certain conditions are met, but this was apparently not an intentional part of the design</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> has a similar situation with the Remnant Vaults. The Andromeda Initiative finds out pretty quickly that the Vaults are able to terraform entire planets, which is very good because the planets they had intended to settle had been environmentally ruined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">the Scourge</a>. But nobody has a clue <em>how</em> any of the Remnant technology actually works, and the dangers of relying on it are pointed out.

<ul><li> The titular robot was the last and greatest creation of Dr. Light, who then had X put through 30 years of ethical testing to ensure that he wouldn't misuse his "limitless" power. When Dr. Cain discovered X and studied the robot, he admitted that some of X's systems were "black boxes" he couldn't understand, but did his best to reproduce X's design. The result was the Reploids, a generation of robots more advanced than anything previous, but the fact that they were all imperfect copies of Light's design led to the Maverick uprisings.

Not only that, but the suit is actually capable of adapting non-Chozo technology to upgrade itself when Samus aquires some, which gets really strange when she picks up Luminoth, Space Pirate and <em>human</em> technology.

They were able to reproduce the various beam weapons used by Samus' suit, though each Space Pirate using the derived weapons was limited to a single type of beam, while Samus can switch freely between them. The bigger hurdle came when the Space Pirates turned to Samus' Morph Ball ability - their Science Team was able to successfully compress a Space Pirate into a small sphere, but having them come out of it intact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">proved problematic.</a>

</li><li> A core mechanic in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XCOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XCOM">XCOM</a></em> titles is having your scientists and engineers do their best to adapt alien technology for your soldiers' use, even if they don't fully understand the principles behind plasma weapons or psionics. Slightly subverted in that your scientists do eventually learn how to apply the principles for other uses. For example, plasma weapons are the top-tier tech branch you can reverse-engineer from the aliens in <em>UFO Defense</em>, but <em>Terror from the Deep</em> takes place underwater, where plasma won't do you much good, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Elerium-115</a> is rendered inert by seawater. So X-COM's science team eventually learns to adapt the same magnetic coils used to contain plasma into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">Magnetic Weapons</a> that fire slugs at high speeds. Additionally, background material for <em>Interceptor</em> states that inert Elerium is actually quite useful as radiation shielding, which is why it's an integral component in humanity's first FTL drives.

<ul><li> Also, a great deal of the series's technology is the product of one man, Joachim Mizrahi. After he died on Militia during the Federation's invasion, a great amount of effort has been poured into piecing his prototypes back together, as well as reassembling his codex of knowledge: the Y-Data. Efforts to recreate his work from scratch by his rival Dr. Sellers amount to impressive, but fatally flawed knock-offs.

<ul><li> In WW II, at a time when electronics were evolving rapidly (e.g. microwave/RADAR technology), the British assembled electronic parts into random yet convincing circuits, then shot and otherwise mangled them, then let their bombers carry them. If one of them was downed, the Germans would go through the wreckage, find the remains and then spend valuable time and manpower to try to figure out what this secret device was supposed to do.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, one of the companions, Kamelion, was, behind the scenes, an actual, animatronic robot. Unfortunately, the person who had designed it and who knew the control codes died after the episode where it first appeared, so the character mostly had to stay in the background.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.html">The Jargon File<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and its dead-tree twin, <em>The New Hacker's Dictionary</em>, is rife with terms describing programming Black Boxes, most notably <a class="urllink" href="http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html">Black Magic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where a switch is found with its two positions labeled "Magic" and "More Magic". The only wire soldered to the switch goes directly to the case of a server—specifically, to a ground pin. There is electrically no way it can affect anything on the server (except for EXTREMELY bizarre capacitance effects), and yet switching to "Magic" causes the server to crash.
<ul><li> It could also be due to a difference in electric potential between the ground and the case.
</li></ul></li><li> Genetic algorithms (computer programs that emulate neo-Darwinian synthesis) can produce hardware that no human could design. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genalg/genalg.html#examples:electrical">For example, an array of logic gates that sets its output high when it hears "go" and low when it hears "stop"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Inside the circuit, 5 of the 37 gates are not even connected to the rest, yet the device stops working when their power is disconnected! An order of magnitude weirder than the magic switch. Other examples include a research team <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2732-radio-emerges-from-the-electronic-soup.html">accidentally reinventing the radio receiver<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while trying to evolve an oscillator, and very unusually shaped antennas that can be held in the palm of the hand and transmit signals from satellites to the surface of the earth. More about the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.netscrap.com/netscrap_detail.cfm?scrap_id=73">magical stop go circuit here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Genetic algorithms have a variant called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">Evolutionary programming.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Basically, it's when you solve a programming task by having the computer generate an initial population of randomly-generated programs, then apply natural selection mechanism to mix-and-match them until you get a program which solves the task satisfactorily... but its code may be completely incomprehensible to a human.
</li><li> To make this an even stronger example, genetic algorithms just make random changes and go with what's best. They don't understand it either. It's a black box even to the designer.
</li></ul></li><li> Black Box programming is a very important concept in real life. For example, all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/API" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/API">APIs</a> (which allow developers to connect to things like Facebook or Google Maps) are black boxes; generally, the only details developers have are usage instructions and a description of what it does, since someone writing, say, a GPS application doesn't need to know anything about how Google Maps works.
<ul><li> In this case, this is actually considered a good thing: abstraction means compatibility. If your software is designed without using any knowledge of how the black box part works, it will (at least in theory) be possible to swap that library out for an updated or improved version later on. So long as <em>somebody</em> knows how it works, it's just a matter of trusting one's fellow engineers. In contrast, the moment you <em>have</em> to know how each variant of something really works instead of just one set of common operations, a task that should be trivial turns into a nightmare. Remember those DOS games and their sound setup programs?
</li><li> In object-oriented programming, objects are supposed to be black boxes, often having public and private groups of variables and functions. The "client" only need to know what the functions do and what should be put in the variables, and not anything about the inner workings. Similarly, template libraries and built-in functions in many programming languages (like C++'s STL) are Black Boxes. The documentation on C++'s sort() function, for example, doesn't tell you what kind of sorting algorithm is used, because it doesn't really matter (although one can deduce that it's probably a quicksort implementation from what they say about its running time).
<ul><li> And if someone else wants the class to do something else, the chances are they'll write another class that extends and/or calls the old one, rather than trying to rewrite the existing source code.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Large amounts of real world software source code is an absolute abomination of incomprehensible abbreviations, architectures which haven't evolved and grown so much as become cancerous, baffling hacks and plain old carelessness and stupidity or even just plain old lack of programming know-how. Such software will gain Black Box status pretty soon after the original developers move on.
<ul><li> Fun fact: Masi Oka (yes, Hiro from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a>) still has to do occasional effects work for his former employer, ILM, because nobody else knows how to use his software.
</li><li> This isn't unusual. Truly understanding non-trivial code written by someone else without documentation is considered the mark of a master programmer. It's said engineers don't retire, they just become consultants and come back to fix their old things when they break.
</li><li> Particularly this is true of cryptographic algorithms. You put plain text and encryption key in, and you get back line noise. Put line noise and decryption key in, and you get back plain text. Unfortunately so few people actually understand the algorithms and code that, even in open source software, bugs can lurk for a long time.
</li><li> More humorous example, in an attempt to cut government costs, California decided to fire a large chunk of government workers, then redo the pay rates for everyone left. Well, phase one went off fine, but come phase two they realized that every single person that knew enough about the payroll software to implement the changes was fired in phase one.
</li></ul></li><li> Older electronic (and most especially military) technologies may well have been designed by people who are dead, coded in languages which no-one ever hears of nowadays, use electronic standards long since obsoleted and built by companies that dissolved or got eaten by other companies some time ago. Black Boxhood arrives quite naturally for such devices, which could conceivably include missile guidance systems or nuclear warhead triggers which are still quite useable today.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOGBANK">FOGBANK<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> COBOL used to be a very common language for developing business software in. Though superseded by modern languages like Java or Visual Basic, old working software was not replaced. The pool of skilled COBOL engineers is rapidly dwindling simply because they are retiring and in due course upgrade and maintenance engineers will simply not exist anymore.
<ul><li> Some colleges have tried to avert this by offering courses in COBOL.
</li></ul></li><li> It seems that the original programming of Microsoft Excel might be a black box, since after the principal programmer quit, the project virtually stopped. Luckily he came back.
</li><li> Many psychiatric drugs work via mechanisms that are either unknown or only loosely understood. The laborious (sometimes decades long) process of searching for side effects and other quirks irons out many of the Black Box problems that plague fiction.
<ul><li> On that subject, some (if not most) chemical reactions in general have mechanisms which are only vaguely understood at best.
</li></ul></li><li> Real Life is rife with stories of a programmer being fired for whatever reason, only for his ex-boss to realize nobody knows how to maintain the server.
</li><li> Due to the "digital rights" controversy, certain laws have been put into effect that <em>require</em> black boxes to remain black boxes, making it <em>illegal</em> even to try to crack into them. For example, it's now illegal to write programs to get past certain types of encoding on music, DVD's, and electronic books. If you have even a slight understanding of the way technology progresses, you'll probably see this move as either "stupid" or "scary", possibly both.
<ul><li> If you've followed the results, "laughable," "doomed," and "legally unenforceable" are more likely.
<ul><li> Especially when the concept of an "illegal number" is thrown around. The people responsible for Blu-Ray's encryption were trying to get people to stop distributing a 128-bit number on the internet because it was the encryption key. Of course, because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">Streisand Effect</a>, this number was posted <em>everywhere</em> on the internet within hours.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, anyone with a basic understanding of motivation and incentive will know very few people would even want to produce such technology in the first place without some protections because it it would just get stolen otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a>: During the early 18th century, Antonio Stradivari hand-crafted several wooden violins that, compared to other violins before or since, produce the highest-quality sound. Many violin manufacturers have, for centuries, attempted to not only replicate the sound of the Stradivarius, but have even labeled violins as "Stradivarius" as a marketing ploy. Unfortunately, when Stradivari died, the technology and skill required to produce a violin of such caliber died with him. Scientists continually do research on the Stradivarius sound and technologies to replicate that sound, and original Stradivarius violins remain to be the most valuable musical instruments in the world.
<ul><li> The "Stradivarius" label on violin is not there for marketing reasons. It's actually a model of violin - Antonio Stradivari's instruments had very specific proportions (also being slightly larger than ones made by competing crafters). If you see a violin labeled "Stradivari", it means that its proportions and size match those of an original Stradivari instrument.
</li><li> It has been speculated that the sound quality is due to the wood available at the time. He built them around the little ice age, and wood at that time was particularly thin and brittle due to the odd weather patterns, making them irreproduceable. On the other hand, other violin makers of the time were unable to reproduce it either.
</li><li> There's also <a class="urllink" href="http://www.economist.com/node/21542380">evidence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Stradivari violins aren't that great in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> Damascus steel. The precise technique through which blacksmiths of medieval Damascus produced their wares has been lost and no one since around 1750 has been able to duplicate the original exactly, although many have claimed to have done so.
</li><li> The philosophy of <em>instrumentalism</em> boils down to "the <em>only</em> important thing about any theory is whether it's usable, i.e. predicts a result of given experiment". Hunting for explanations is but a pointless infinite regression. This means that "light is truly made of particles" and "light is truly made of waves" are fancy statements that delusionally bind real events to imaginary constructs while "wave model correctly and in convenient form predicts diffraction/interference effects" or "particle model correctly and in convenient form predicts absorption/emission effects" states everything that really matters in this issue. From this point of view <em>anything</em> is a Black Box, the only difference is that we already know how to dismantle some blackboxes to several smaller blackboxes and what buttons to push.
</li><li> Arguably the universe itself is a black box since we don't (yet) have a complete physical theory of the universe. Also, while we do have two theories that work fine in their respective arenas (General Relativity: big and heavy stuff, Quantum Mechanics: small and light stuff), they are contradictory and become completely incomprehensible when used together.
<ul><li> There's also an older theory called classical Newtonian mechanics, which works for medium-size and medium-mass stuff. It was specifically created to avert this trope and describe a Universe governed by simple, understandable laws; it failed at that. However, it works nicely for 90% of the stuff we encounter in our lives, and that's why it, and not GR or quantum is taught at schools.
</li></ul></li><li> The plans for the Saturn V rocket from the Apollo Project are stored in a format that isn't readable by any computer currently in use. Since there are a few leftover rockets, that could potentially be fueled up and fired, they have become black boxes. When the new designs for the Orion spacecraft (not the nuclear-bomb one, the newer one) were in the works, the ability to look at the old Saturn design and learn from them was denied the engineers, who had to waste potentially years starting from scratch. Since then, to avoid this trope, a project was initiated to attempt to retrieve the data and transfer it onto a more modern storage medium, but it's so underfunded that it's not currently active.
<ul><li> Although some of that is true, there are other significant factors involved - for instance, not being allowed to use asbestos anymore even though we know how. It's not <em>purely</em> a case of "no longer able to read the plans."
</li><li> This is an urban myth. The Saturn V plans are stored on microfilm. While readers are not nearly as commonplace as they were at the time of the rocket's conception, they're still readily available.
</li><li> Though microfilms do exist, several key parts were destroyed due to Cold War policies on classified materials. The Orion engineers also had access to the engines from one of the original (IXX, I think) F1 engines taken from the rocket currently displayed at the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, thanks to a heady mixture of personal eccentricities, outlandish claims, and industrial FUD both during and after his time, has a reputation for this sort of thing rivaled only by fiction. All his <em>well-documented</em> inventions work from explicable, if clever, principles of engineering — but poorly documented claims abound of death rays, earthquake generators, and yet stranger things unreproducible by modern science.
<ul><li> The fact his documented ideas tended to get stolen (usually by Edison) might have something to do with it.
</li></ul></li><li> SR-71 Blackbird recon plane: Due to ongoing modifications to their respective airframes each Blackbird had its own set of blueprints. Thus, each Blackbird was unique, although they looked identical. The original molds or dies used in the manufacturing of the planes were ordered destroyed by then Secretary of Defense McNamara (Cold War policies again) so it would be nearly imposible to make new Blackbirds or even spare parts (In fact other airframes had to be cannibalized to keep the fleet airworthy), although a lot of planes survive to this day so reverse engineering could be feasible.
</li><li> The human body itself is quite the black box. With the exception of your occasional doctor or biologist, everyone uses theirs without the slightest hint of how the lot of it works. The brain in particular is quite the mystery, for if it was simple enough we could easily understand it, we would be unable to do exactly that.
</li><li> While there is still debate on the subject, nobody knows <em>for sure</em> why a bicycle stays upright when you ride it. It just does. Numerous theories have been put forth with some of them holding water. See this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19442_8-simple-questions-you-wont-believe-science-cant-answer.html">Cracked article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> The same article also lists several other questions that even modern science can't answer: why we sleep, how many planets are in the Solar System, why ice is slippery, how to beat Solitaire, how many animal species exist, what is the length of the US (or any) coastline, how does gravity work. A lot of these questions that we just either never ask or accept a universally-known explanation, which is actually false.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a fad for "miracle cure" machines at the beginning of the twentieth century that were actually called Black Box machines. You just set a few controls, turned it on, and whatever quack therapy that model was based on would cure the illness. The reason they were intentionally kept as black boxes was the controls did nothing to its function, and most in fact had no working parts.
</li><li> Any self-taught coder will make these whenever they program... well anything. How bad it is depends on the degree of "self-taughtedness".
</li><li> This situation tends to happen whenever a nation receives exported military equipment from another nation's military (planes, tanks, ships etc.) and something sours political relations between them. A sudden change in government, or an embargo due to some unsavory incident can effectively turn a chunk of a nation's military into a black box. No longer getting the support in terms of maintenance to keep them in service or upgrades to keep them relevant, the material in question rapidly becomes warehoused for fear of damaging it beyond repair or obsolete. Solutions are varied, ranging from reverse-engineering, putting in locally-made upgrades, producing their own replacements or getting a replacement from another friendly nation. Examples include the F-14's Iran received before the Shah was overthrown and various helicopter models China received just before the Tienanmen Square incident.
<ul><li> The Japanese have bought a license for an advanced Russian jet. They assemble it exactly by the blueprints, and it turns out to be a steam locomotive. They check the blueprints, gather their best engineers and assemble it again. Still locomotive. They file a complaint to the Russians, so the Russian team arrives, goes into the workshop and shortly produces a perfectly good jet. The Japanese are astonished: "We've tried it again and again and only got a steam train!" "Why, of course", reply the Russians, "did you Read the Fine Print? First you get a steam train. And then you work on it with a rasp."
</li></ul></li><li> For a very common (and far more mundane) example, many, if not most, things that people use day-to-day are effectively black boxes. There is an oft-quoted analogy about how the ability to <em>drive</em> a car does not equate an ability to design and <em>build</em> a car, or even to fix one. For a fun thinking exercise, see if you can actually explain the workings of a microwave oven, or a computer, or a cell phone, or any other number of things you use daily.
<ul><li> Once you give up, go <a class="urllink" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In biology, the occasional black box arises in the form of a living organism. For example, of the twenty or so species of beaked whale known to science, about three are well documented. The rest are very poorly understood, some of which we haven't even seen living specimens of yet. Where they live, how they breed, what they eat, how deep they dive, none of these are known. We know that they exist because we have dead bodies (for a while, one species was known only by <em>a jawbone</em>), but <em>how</em> they exist is largely a mystery.
</li><li> For much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, nuclear weapons were black boxes, either entirely or to the people working with them. All nukes were designed by multiple people, but sometimes these teams worked loosely with each other in isolation, the effect being that no one person knew how a particular nuclear weapon worked. This method of security eventually fell out of favor as some of the bombs produced by these teams were abject failures; to the extent that at one point in US history, nearly all the warheads carried by US submarines were duds due to their faulty safety systems. In the other case of nuclear black boxes, teams designing ICBMs and bomb cases were given the bare minimum of information needed to design a delivery system.
<ul><li> A remarkable example of this effect is describing how, exactly, thermonuclear bombs work: Only the engineers and scientists who have designed them actually <em>know.</em> Even though the technology is over a half-a-century old and possessed by at least half-a-dozen countries, details of the mechanism have remained strictly classified. The public "Teller-Ulam" design which may (or may <em>not</em>) be the de facto standard for all fusion weapons has been pieced together mainly through inference and assumption, and is quite free of details.
</li></ul></li><li> Several of the computer rankings that make up the Bowl Championship Series formula in college football are proprietary. Accordingly, no one exactly knows why they would rank the teams in the way they do, and major bowl bids (and millions of dollars) can hinge on the result. The BCS system was replaced in 2014 by a selection committee that decides how teams are ranked, with the top four teams playing for a national championship at the end of the season.
</li><li> The Turk was a machine built in the eighteenth century that supposedly was able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent. Though the cabinet could be opened to reveal a complex gear mechanism, nobody who saw it in action could figure out how it worked. Of course, the reason was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Turk wasn't an automaton at all, but was concealing a human player</span>, and the reason no one could determine exactly what was going on for almost a century was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the human player</span> was very well-hidden. That said, several people over that span came close to figuring it out, but their hypotheses were always flawed in some way.
</li><li> Hex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> (above) was based on one of Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s own computers, a ZX Spectrum he tinkered with and added hardware to until it did what he wanted. Eventually he lost track of it all, and there were components which he couldn't remember or deduce the purpose of, but it you took them out everything stopped working.
</li><li> Black boxes, often by that name, are used as an important learning tool in signal processing. The idea is that you give a student a way to produce a variety of inputs (oscillators, noise generators), a suite of measuring tools (oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers), and a black box. By applying different inputs, taking measurements, and applying the signal processing principles they've been taught, they try to infer exactly what's inside the black box. With enough constraints on the parameters (e.g., "This will only contain amplifiers and attenuators, because we haven't learned about filters yet.") the black box can become simply a logic puzzle.
</li><li> In topology diagrams used by computer network admins, a part of the network whose internal structure is unknown or irrelevant is represented by a cloud. A site to site WAN linking two corporate sites, such as an internet VPN tunnel or private WAN are good examples. The admin doesn't have to worry about what technologies are used internally within the cloud; they just care that it gets packets from one side to the other. This is where the term "cloud computing" comes from.
</li><li> At the University of Oxford there is a battery powering a bell that was made in 1840 and is still running today and nobody knows how this is possible because the records of how the battery was made were lost. They are waiting for it to run out of power before they take it apart to see how it works.
</li><li> A significant part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges">The Dark Ages</a> after the fall of the Roman Empire turned a lot of the Empire's technological developments into this. Highly effective concrete, the ability to build aqueducts, their methods of producing weapons and armor, and more were all lost when the Empire collapsed, and it took hundreds of years for society to recover to the point where they could reach and surpass it. In the East this is <em>still</em> happening with the Byzantine recipe for Greek Fire. When the Empire fell the recipe was lost, and to this day no one knows what was in it in order to make it be able to burn so intensely, even on water.
</li><li> A variant of this trope: in ancient times doctors would recommend people suffering from depression and the like drink mineral water from springs. While it worked, they had no idea why. It turns out to be because water from springs tends to contain a lot of lithium, which has an anti-depressant effect and is still used for that purpose.
