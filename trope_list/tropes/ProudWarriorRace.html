<p>A specific subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, the Proud Warrior Race Guy seeks battle and bloodshed because his culture teaches that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">doing so is the greatest source of personal honor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">glory</a>. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Proud Warrior Race</a> will often be based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">one of several real world cultures</a> who are perceived to have acted this way, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">Samurai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">Spartans</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Vikings</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast">Mongols</a>. They are often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture">Martyrdom Culture</a>. The Proud Warrior Race Guy is almost always a hero.

Critiques of this position will be met with: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything">You do</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything">not</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything">understand</a>". May occasionally overlap with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race, though the two are usually differentiated by the Proud Warrior having a strict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour">Code of Honour</a> (which may include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebtDetester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebtDetester">paying debts</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">loyalty to companions and officers</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">fighting with honor</a>), while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> race has no real rules and does cowardly or underhanded things. If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour">Code of Honour</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">too alien for humans to understand</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfThePeople">too xenophobic to allow cooperation</a>, then the heroes will treat the two groups as the same. The better sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour">Code of Honour</a> will enforce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootACivilian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootACivilian">Would Not Shoot a Civilian</a>, although often because civilians are dismissed as too weak and cowardly to be good fighters, and so they get passed over in the search for worthy enemies.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>While most commonly seen in science fiction programs in the guise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a>, the Proud Warrior Race Guy is not limited to that genre. Consider Hawk in <em>Spenser For Hire</em>, B.A. in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>, and Tonto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em> or Kato in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGreenHornet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGreenHornet">The Green Hornet</a></em>. This trope currently tends to be limited to SF because applying it to human races really skirts the bounds of current racial sensitivities. You don't see a lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savage</a> anymore either, except as alien races, for the same reason.
</p><p>One variant to this might be a Proud <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalHunter">Hunter</a></em> Race Guy, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">Predator</a></em>, clad in bones and skulls with a head mounted on a spear. Just replace the aforementioned 'battle and bloodshed' with 'worthy prey and trophies,' and replace the large scale wars and battlefields with extended hunts in the jungle or swamp. These types tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>, since hunting requires one to be quiet when stalking prey. Individuals of this variant might be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterTrapper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterTrapper">Hunter Trapper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarilyCompetentTracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarilyCompetentTracker">Scarily Competent Tracker</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">The Beastmaster</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert">Stealth Expert</a> when compared to other versions of this trope, but will generally speak and behave extremely similarly. Species that are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligentGerbil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligentGerbil">aliens/creatures based on predatory animals</a>, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Cat Folk</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a> often found in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> and Fantasy works, are apt to be of this type because of the connotation between them and their predatory animal inspiration. This variant is also one of the few ways to play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EgomaniacHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EgomaniacHunter">Egomaniac Hunter</a> trope straight while also allowing it to be a heroic figure.

These guys have a tendency to be more technologically advanced and more focused on expansion than conquest  they don't see the harm in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">dishonorable tactics</a>, but they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">pragmatic, not ruthless</a>; The Proud Soldier Race Guy isn't likely to cause any more harm than absolutely necessary to get what he wants.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> introduces the Saiyan race from Planet Vegeta (of whom Prince Vegeta and Goku are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">only pure-blooded survivors</a>). Their instinct to fight in addition to their incredible natural strength, ability to transform into giant apes under a full moon, and, later in the series, their power to become Super Saiyans, makes them hugely dangerous and feudal; though Vegeta, the Prince of all Saiyans (as he is very quick to point out), seems under the impression that he's the last of a race of noble, honourable warriors that lived by their strength alone...but he actually fights more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> who isn't averse to cheap moves to win against a stronger opponent (or toying with weaker ones instead of finishing them off quickly). Goku and half-Saiyans like Goten and Trunks have less of an idea of honour but retain the Saiyan fighting instinct. In the former's case, Vegeta hints the Saiyan sense of honour is inherent in pure-blooded Saiyans since Goku knows nothing of Saiyan culture, and still would've rather died (or gave up the fight) than achieve victory over an opponent by eating a senzu bean to win.
</li><li> Averted by Gohan, who is half-Saiyan (and very powerful) but doesn't really enjoy fighting as much as other Saiyans. He doesn't much bother with training unless he anticipates having to fight a villain. Despite being one of the most intelligent characters in the series, he's too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">Genre Blind</a> to realize there will <em>always</em> be another villain to fight.
</li><li> Gohan's brother, Goten, as well as his best friend (and son of Vegeta) Trunks, seem to enjoy fighting, but see it more as a fun game than as a manner of honor.
</li><li> Also averted with Gohan's grandmother, Gine. She was born a pacifistic among the Saiyans.
</li><li> Averted yet again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> by the Saiyans of Universe 6, who share very little of the warrior culture embraced by their Universe 7 counterparts.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mykene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>. Although not all of them were warriors, these that were showed they were proud of their warlike skills and eager for using them. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Warrior Beasts</a> were made by grafting into the mechanical body of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> the brain of a Mykene soldier indoctrinated to fight and exterminate all non-Mykene civilizations.
</li><li> The Vegans from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> were also one race whose society revolved around fighting and war. Many commanders of the army belonged to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> school of thought and would rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">dying taking their enemy with them</a> before admitting defeat.
</li><li> Shishio Makoto of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> is this trope taken to its darkest logical conclusion; a warrior whose respect for strength is so <em>absolute</em> that he wishes to create a Japan where <em>everyone</em> has to be a warrior just to <em>survive.</em>
</li><li> Done very well on the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em>, where the four main characters were all Proud Warrior Race Guys, but some of them had huge doubts about the whole thing — and while some of them become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poets</a>, they were very unusual ones.
</li><li> The Zentraedi race (divided into "Zentran" and "Meltran", or male and female, sides) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> are examples of this trope. It also serves as a bit of a deconstruction, as the Zentraedi have no idea how to even repair their own equipment (<em>everyone</em> is a warrior; no scientists and no engineers). This was intentional, to render them ineffective if they ever turned against their masters. Indeed, a major running theme of the series (in particular the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>) is the Zentraedi becoming "cultured" by learning how to pursue (or even simply enjoy) more peaceful pastimes.
<ul><li> Klein Klan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> is a Worf of sorts for the Zentraedi; while she isn't a raging berserker most of the time (although after a certain event in the plot she gets rather terrifying), she is <em>extremely</em> proud of her heritage and generally doesn't miss a chance to remind people of Zentraedi superiority in combat and warfare whenever possible, despite being fully "cultured". Hilariously, she also suffers from some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> given how often she gets a hole blown in her power armor, and, to her profound and continued annoyance, she's only about four and a half feet tall whenever she's "micronized" down to human size outside of combat.
</li></ul></li><li> Technically, the Pillar Men of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency</a></em> are a proud warrior race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires</a>, but in practice only Wamuu counts, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> who shows respect whenever an enemy turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>; Santana is mindlessly destructive, Esidisi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> showoff, and Kars is power-mad.

The first two giants the crew meet, in fact, take this to the extreme by fighting for a century (a third their lifespan) over a quarrel they've both long forgotten purely because their honor is at stake. Also: Wiper and the other Shandian Warriors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Pai Thunder</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dangaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dangaioh">Dangaioh</a></em> initially refuses to team with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveEverygirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveEverygirl">Naïve Everygirl</a> Mia Alice because she is not warrior-like. As it turns out, Pai is genetically predisposed to violence, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because she is really Barius, the daughter of pirate warlord The Banker. Once her father tries to force her kill one of her classmates and Mia bails her out, she accepts Mia's leadership</span>.
</li><li> The vampires from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em> are very much a proud warrior race, to the point that Moka's father once ordered her two older sisters to fight to the death simply to measure Akuha's strength.
</li><li> The Yato Clan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> are knows everywhere in the universe for being the strongest warrior race.
</li><li> Nouza of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaikingLegendOfDaikuMaryu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaikingLegendOfDaikuMaryu">Gaiking: Legend of Daiku Maryu</a></em> is the strongest Knight in Darius, a fact that he throws around with great abandon. On multiple occasions, he executes his underlings for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">sullying the name of the Darius Knights</a>.
</li><li> Though all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople">Nations as People</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> fit this to some degree (because, as stated earlier, all human cultures do), the one most resembling this trope is Germany's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">big brother</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">Prussia</a>, who blatantly totes his used-to-be-empire as superior to all others, and is perfectly willing to prove it when given the chance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">especially against Austria</a>. As is the standard for this trope, Prussia gets horrifically beaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Hungary</a>, and later he is dissolved and given to Russia.
</li><li> The werewolves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessResurrection">Princess Resurrection</a></em> are this. To the point where they properly introduce themselves before a fight and identify their parents! "I am Riza Wildman! Daughter of the warrior Volg Wildman!" They take great offense to ANY challenge to their or their family's honor or strength. Hime even made a point of killing Risa's brother Lobo from the front because she knew a werewolf warrior getting killed from behind is considered an unbearable stain on his/her honor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, while many civilians do exist, a large amount of youths become ninja. There doesn't seem to be a specific age-limit on being a ninja. Some clans such as the Aburame seem to make it obligatory for their members to become ninja. Most people become ninjas between eleven and thirteen, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a>'s like Kakashi can become genin at as young as five. During the Warring Clan's era, the average life expectancy of ninjas was 30 due to the large amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a> ninjas getting killed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/RetiredHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/RetiredHeroes">Retired Heroes</a></em>: It's mentioned that the demons hold a massive fighting contest to determine who their leaders are. And the contest used to be lethal.

She's sweet to most but can easily become violent. In her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">"first meeting"</a> with the Titans recalled in a later episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">TV series</a>, she was this way too, making her "later" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> personality seem rather puzzling, though her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> behavior does appear sometimes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Starfire in the cartoon was designed like a foreign exchange student.

</li><li> Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Skrulls</a> are military and expansionist, but are too sneaky and underhanded to really be this trope. Their hereditary enemies the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainMarVell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainMarVell">Kree,</a> on the other hand, actively revere war as a <em>concept.</em>
</li><li> Prince Acroyear of the Acroyears, from Marvel's toy-licensed comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Micronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Micronauts">Micronauts</a></em>. Worth noting because he's one of the earliest mass-market appearances of the Proud Warrior Race Guy as a stock crew member on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a>. It's also worth noting that he's portrayed as dark-skinned, despite otherwise-alien features — i.e., "played by an African-American". That's not just incidental, either: a major plot point has his albino brother driven to madness/evil/betrayal by his perceived inferiority.
</li><li> Wildstorm's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATS">Zealot</a> is a pretty standard (female) example of this trope.

</li></ul></li><li> The concept of a proud warrior race was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">deconstructed</a> with the Wolrog Empire, who appeared in a long <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrontiumDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrontiumDog">Strontium Dog</a></em> story when <em>Starlord</em> merged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD">2000 AD</a></em>. The Wolrogs are psychotic, vicious, cruel, sadistic, genocidal maniacs who live only for battle and death, and are feared and hated by the other races in the galaxy. They tend to kidnap innocent people to serve as captive soldiers or slaves to fuel the war effort. In the same comic, Wulf may be an example of the more noble variety.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> and the rest of the Asgardians. Loki and Amora the Enchantress are considered cowards and deviants for using magic, dirty tricks, and deception, as they dislike fighting and only fight as a last resort.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Marvel's early Generation 1 comics, Megatron considered himself to be one of these, as seen by his distaste for killing an easy foe like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Ratchet</a>, and in a later issue his joy at getting to kill Ratchet after the latter had learned some of the way of the warrior. Much later, in the UK story "The Fall and Rise of the Decepticon Empire", he actually refers to the Decepticons as a 'proud warrior race'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW">The Transformers (IDW)</a></em> has turned Thundercracker into a Proud Warrior Race Guy, one who isn't very satisfied with the current state of Decepticon affairs <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and ends up joining the Autobots.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Maxima enjoys battle so much that she considers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">her fight against Doomsday</a> to be a fun time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a>'s/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a>'s Shatterstar is another Marvel example. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">By design</a>.
</li><li> Nolan and the other Viltrumites from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em> are this. The whole Viltrumite race is basically what would happen if Spartans had Superman-like superpowers.

They also favor primitive weapons like swords and double-barreled pistols, especially for ritual combat.
</li><li> Marvel's Kree, Skrull, and Shi'ar empires are all like this to a greater or lesser extent. Though as shapeshifters, the Skrulls certainly see no dishonor in using deception as a tactic. The offshoot of the Skrull race known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RomSpaceknight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RomSpaceknight">Dire Wraiths</a> are an aversion. They're so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">self-consciously evil</a> that they would probably take any suggestion that they had honor as an <em>insult.</em> Understandably, the Skrulls hate them.
<ul><li> The Kree mixes this trope with modern militarism and the Shi'ar are pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans">Space Romans</a>.

</li><li> The Phaedons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BadPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BadPlanet">Bad Planet</a></em> are another desconstructed example: large, grey humanoid aliens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">no individual names</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless">don't need to eat or breath</a> bred only for fighting and killing.

Orube is one of the best warriors, having been trained both in Basiliade and Kandrakar; unfortunately, her mental training hasn't been quite as effective, and she still sometimes has problems controlling her temper.
</li><li> The Horde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrikeforceMorituri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrikeforceMorituri">Strikeforce: Morituri</a></em> play this straight with each other, but subvert it in their treatment of humans, where they act as savage bullies from a position of strength.

The land of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Boreale</a> was trapped in a glacial bowl during Remnant's most recent Ice Age, isolating the region from "the Advent of Dust" to combat the Grimm. While the other Kingdom's flourished with technology derived from using Dust to build and reclaim the world, the Boreale were left to their own devices. While the extreme terrain of Borealeand more than a few of the region's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChainofEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChainofEvil">fauna</a>shielded the primeval tribes from the brunt of Grimm invasions, the Boreal Knights were founded to combat the handfuls that managed to worm their way into the populated regions.

<div class="indent"><em>ThunderClan is quite militaristic compared to their neighbors. Apprentices are trained as much, if not more, in fighting as they are in hunting, and the sheer enthusiasm for battle means that challenging them is a very, very bad idea. The other Clans are understandably reluctant to engage them in a fight, but they will grudgingly admit that ThunderClans reputation as a gang that eats the bones of loners and kittypets has prevented a significant amount of trouble for everyone else.</em>
</div></li><li> This is a common attitude in Wings of Fire, especially among the IceWings in Pyrrhia and the Poison faction of the LeafWings in Pantala. The IceWings believe their tribe to be superior to any others, and start training their dragonets to be soldiers much earlier than other tribes, putting great emphasis on fighting for their queen and fellow IceWings. The most prominent example of this is Winter, though his character development dampens this a lot. Sundew is the best LeafWing example, although her tribe is more warlike as revenge for when the HiveWings attempted genocide on them than in a purely cultural way.

Failure to do so results in all points being revoked, essentially making an individual worthless unless they manage to regain those points by revenge-killing the target that originally caused them to lose the points. This explains why so many hire themselves out as mercenaries, bounty hunters, and assassins; while most are generally violent and completely amoral, their most famous representative, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">psychopathic</a> bounty hunter Bossk, takes this to a whole new level. Hunting non-sentient big game qualified for points as well, so long as it was dangerous enough to be life-threatening, but Bossk was one of many Transdoshans who specifically focused on Wookiees as prey, seeing them as the most dangerous game of all and thus worth the most points. The rare Trandoshan characters <em>not</em> to engage in such behavior presumably just didn't adhere to the Scorekeeper religion.
</li><li> Mandalorians subvert the trope by not always being a Race or Species. Instead they're a Warrior Culture. They were first made up of aliens called the Taung but were replaced by Rodians, Twi'leks, Zeltrons, Humans and others as Taung numbers were worn down during the Mandalorian Crusades. Humans dominated their culture by the Empire era, but members of other species are still allowed to join Mandalorian society. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jn6j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0jn6j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jn6j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> If you follow their warrior code, wear the armor, and an established Mando adopts you into their clan, it's just as good as being born into it.

Well, go out there and <em>adopt</em> a few kids! </span> As one of their historical leaders, Mandalore the Destroyer put it, Mandalorians aren't merely an army or even a race, they're an idea, and this makes the Mandalorians as a whole immortal no matter how many of their warriors fall in battle. And despite the historical enmity between the Mandalorians and the Jedi, there were examples of Jedi Knights and even a few Jedi <em>Masters</em> renouncing the Order to become Mandalorians over the centuries. Ironically, Humans and the Taung fought for control of Coruscant as far back as 25,000 years before the rise of the Empire. The Taung retreat from Coruscant led to the founding of Mandalorian society.

In fact, to die gloriously in battle is the fondest hope of most Vong warriors, because they believe that death is more important than life, and that is how their gods will judge them. Somewhat unusually, they are willing to lie and cheat to get what they want, though that is more to do with their code of honor not applying to 'infidels' (and members of the non-warrior castes are bound by much more lenient codes to begin with). There <em>are</em> non-warrior-caste Vong, and while they share some central tenets (strength through sacrifice, the transitory and painful nature of life, the abhorrence of machinery) the other castes tend to be just as fanatically honor-bound to pursue some other objective, such as the shapers (hat: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a>) and the intendants (hat: bureaucracy.

By virtue of being the only species in the galaxy that has evolved to be able to stomach fighting and killing other sentient beings, without fainting out of horror or revulsion, humanity is freakishly strong (capable of breaking other species' bones just by swatting their hands away), enormously resilient and completely batshit crazy. So much so, in fact, that the galactic community refuses to grant humanity citizenship for centuries after co-opting them to fight in a war against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a>.

<ul><li> The Dothraki are based on the "violent raider" image of Mongols, being expert horse archers.
</li><li> The Ironborn are a Viking-ish culture, but resemble more a pirate race than the historical Vikings.
</li><li> The wildlings have aspects of the trope, but are more anarchic in nature.
</li><li> The Northmen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros reflect the gruff, straightforward "code of honor" aspect, whilst the southern half of Westeros embodies genteel chivalry. And then there are the Northern Mountain Clans, who are essentially are as to Northerners as Northerners are to Southerners.
</li><li> Most of Westerosi society at its core, and a lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a> comes from their pride as warriors above all else. Women, scholars, artists, and merchants, people who are valued and respected in modern times, are generally disdained because they aren't expected to be warlike, or their trades aren't directly connected to warcraft, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect">despite the invaluable service they can and do provide to others and society as a whole</a>.

<ul><li> The Idirans. They were an aggressive warrior species which considered it their holy duty to bring order to the universe and its lesser races. They're best known for their <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiran-Culture_War">48 year war against The Culture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which they lost.
</li><li> The Affront are like this as well, best illustrated by the fact they're proud to be called the Affront. The Affront Diplomatic Service consists entirely of the most xenophobic and violent Affronters, lest other races think they're going soft by even <em>having</em> a Diplomatic Service. They're basically an entire race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">General Melchetts</a>, where buffoonish jollity barely masks deep-rooted sadism. Unlike the Idirans they're basically friendly to the Culture as long as there's no particular reason not to be, a friendship the Culture finds exhausting and frustrating. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Which is why a group of Minds form a conspiracy to encourage the Affront to declare war, so the Culture has an excuse to slap them back down.</span>
</li><li> The books like deconstructing this type of race. Warrior races have one ultimate flaw: They enjoy war. No matter how much they pretend otherwise, they don't actually want their wars to end, and have no problem with them continuing forever. This contrasts with the Culture, communist space hippies, who <em>hate</em> war, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">and therefore fight in the most brutal and efficient manner possible</a>.

<ul><li> The novels were originally supposed to be about a Proud Warrior Race Guy, Wulfgar son of Beornegar of the Tribe of Elk (one of the barely-Viking-ish warrior tribes of the northern region of Faerun), captured in battle and made an indentured servant by a dwarf king. He eventually went out the way all Proud Warrior Race Guys want to — defending friends and family from a great menace, and succeeding. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">He didn't stay dead for more than three books</a> — but that was over six years of world time.
</li><li> Drizzt himself is basically a Proud Warrior Race Guy, having grown up for around 30 years in an underground city full of vicious assassins who are trained from birth in the most efficient, vicious ways of killing living things. His homeland is, in essence, a gigantic, sadistic special forces unit (his race possess remarkable prowess in the areas of stealth and unit tactics, while at the same time possessing a huge superiority complex over all other living creatures including each other and having a vicious sadistic streak, making them more Arrogant Warrior Race Guys). It sounds like he's even more noble and sacrifice-loving than any Proud Warrior Race Guy ever, but he possesses a remarkable survival instinct and is portrayed as too badass to actually die, even when he tries self-sacrifice. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He does die once, in a duel to the death against his archenemy, but only for one page, not counting the year between the end of the book he dies in and the very first page of the next.</span> Then we get into the Arrogant Assassin Race Guys issue, which is quite different. The drow are an example of why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> doesn't make for good proud warrior races — they have no concept of honour, often even no interest in a good fight, just getting ahead at everyone else's expense at minimum cost. The way Drizzt demonstrates he's (to a small extent) learnt to think like a drow during his training is when he challenges his last remaining opponent in a free-for-all between students to an open, honourable single combat, which he knows he can win — only to have the other step in a trap he has set up, by which Drizzt proves he wouldn't do anything so stupid as to issue an honourable challenge anymore.

They also dislike the use of any weapons or magic—in the later books, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they decide to prevent anyone else from using Earthpower, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">as such power in the hands of mortals leads only to destruction</a> in their eyes.</span>

</li><li> The Scylvendi from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse">Second Apocalypse</a></em> take this trope to a scary extreme. They call themselves "the People of War" or sometimes just "the People". To them, war is both the method and object of worship. Cnaiur, the main Scylvendi character, scoffs at the concept of a Holy War. To him, <em>all</em> war is holy.
</li><li> The Icecarls of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower">The Seventh Tower</a></em>. Brought up under a warrior tradition, all their great epics and stories seem to be about people dying heroic deaths on the Ice.

They look down on housecats (whom they refer to derisively as "kittypets") because (most) housecats are cowardly and unable to fight well. They do, however, pride themselves on honor, codified in their "Warrior Code", which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">forbids killing</a> (even in battle, unless their enemy is willing to kill them), and tells them to help another Clan if it is in danger. Every cat, bar MedicineCats and those who are seriously disabled, is expected to become a warrior and live by the Warrior Code. Kittens start training to become warriors at six moons/months (roughly the equivalent of ten to thirteen in humans) and become full warriors at twelve moons. It used to be younger, however the Clans changed it generations ago so that fewer kits would die (though ShadowClan still uses barely-weaned kits as warriors at the start of the series due to their corrupt leader). The desire to fight is so engrained into warriors that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cinderpelt, a warrior apprentice who ultimately became a medicinecat because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">leg injury</a>, was allowed to reincarnate so that she could experience the life she truly wanted as a warrior</span>.

However, the book primarily focuses on their innocent victims whose lives have been made living hells. The Holnists conquer huge swathes of territory, rape the local women and then induct them into their harems, castrate all the men who are too peaceable to have the kind of "warrior spirit" the Holnists value, and kill the men who do have a "warrior spirit" if they refuse to be inducted into Holnist society.

<ul><li> The Tsurani <em>appear</em> to be this, and it's understandable that you get this impression after reading the Riftwar novels because you really only see the outward appearance of the race. The Empire Trilogy takes you into the society itself, and it doesn't take long to learn that the "honorable warrior" culture is almost entirely subverted by the rulers and nobles of the Empire, who consider the Tsurani concept of "honor" a weapon, to be used alongside assassination, manipulation, espionage, bargaining, and all sorts of other tools in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> toolbox, in order to gain an advantage.
</li><li> The Valheru also initially give the appearance of this, as the closest thing to a Valheru we meet, Tomas, is only <em>half</em>-Valheru: his Valheru warrior nature is tempered by his human (and later Elven) cultural honor. The actual Valheru really aren't this at all, as they make no pretense of operating under a code of honor, and openly admit to serving only their own desires.

Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">Demons</a> have elements of this, being both proud and warriors, though these traits in them stem less from honor and belief and more from their extremely animalistic natures.

During the days of the Silver Kingdoms, they were the kingdom charged with "maintaining the terrible arts of killing" while they waited for the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Desolation</a> to come. After the last Desolation, they were no longer needed, but they never gave up their arms. After over four and a half thousand years they degenerated into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a> fighting for no other purpose than the fighting itself. They see peace and negotiation as signs of cowardice, scoff at any masculine arts that don't directly involve killing, and spend most of their time fighting themselves in what would be considered civil war if they hadn't been doing it for so long that it had become routine.
</li><li> In another deconstruction, many Alethi highprinces don't even adhere to what would be typical "warrior race" traits. For example, some of the highprinces are outright cowards who refuse to go into battle unless absolutely necessary, and will send waves of expendable slaves ahead of their armies to protect the "real" soldiers. They use deception, legal loopholes, spies, assassins, and social mores to manipulate others in a ruthless game of politics. It turns out that when a society is based around ferocious competition to see who is the strongest, <em>anything</em> that helps one get ahead is fair game.
</li><li> The Parshendi, or "singers" in their own tongue, prove to be one of these when they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">in warform</a>, which causes them to grow stronger and develop armor over their skin. They also develop a tendency toward discipline and control, and enjoy following orders from someone they consider a superior. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer">Oathbringer</a></em>, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Alethi Parshmen are also this once they've been awoken from their mental limitations, adopting a militant and defensive stance that they inherited through cultural osmosis due to countless generations of living in Alethi territory</span>.

In rather a subversion the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a> of them all is the Roman Army which really is not this as they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatists</a> who put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">reason equal to honor</a> in priority.

Axumites have a sort of "anti-ostentation" that resembles Sparta; not only are they modest they make a point of displaying their spartan-ness until it is an affectation in itself. And they demand vigorously that their kings be soldiers like themselves. Persians have a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast">central asian wildness</a> and Imperialistic splendour.

Riker teaches the local nobles how to play poker but finds it far too easy to beat them. Then he realizes why: they never fold. When he asks them about it, they tell him that a true warrior never backs down from a fight. He then explains it in a way that makes sense to them: a good general will cut his losses and pull back his troops in order to win a battle or a war. Once they start seeing the game in this way, they get much better at it. Another local starts a rivalry with Worf and demands a duel to the death. They postpone it until the end of the book, but then they (quite sensibly) decide to settle this matter with a game of poker.

Warrior races seem to be some of the worst to have as patrons as they're as ruthless to their clients as to their targets, and in general are quite unpleasant, no matter whether they're the honor-bound or ruthless savage type, with some of them, like the genocidal Tandu, being humanity's worst enemies. Interestingly, humans themselves, being the sole well-known "wolfling" race (ones that evolved civilization and sapience on their own rather than being uplifted) are viewed as this by many, and really enjoy playing up their perceived savagery in diplomacy and in combat.

<ul><li> The Warrior Caste of the Minbari had this attitude, to some degree, especially the more fanatical ones who refused to accept the seemingly nonsensical surrender to an almost-wiped-out Earth. Of course, the war itself was somewhat nonsensical, but that was the Religious Caste's fault.
<ul><li> The Religious caste started the war, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">when they had second thoughts</a>, the Warrior Caste enthusiastically kept it going.
</li><li> The Grey Council had just had their leader, as well as who knows how many others, killed in a particularly brutal example of culture shock. It's pretty clear that nobody was thinking clearly at the moment. It makes sense that the hidebound Grey Council would fall back on what they normally do to solve dilemmas.
</li><li> Living in the same universe with Centauri, Narn, and now Humans (who have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">rather interesting history</a> to say the least) let alone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">the Shadows</a> is not a thing that tends to make for amiable personality traits. If your mother had told you that the Evil Dark Crab Monsters would get you if you weren't good, what would you be like?
</li><li> The Minbari Warrior Caste seemed to act in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement">rather wussy</a> manner during the Shadow War and let the Religious Caste do their fighting for them.
</li><li> Though not considered canon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">many B5 fans think the Warrior Caste, like the Clarke Administration and Emperor Cartagia's government, had been infiltrated and influenced by the Shadows</a>. Even if this wasn't the case, long-standing tensions between the two castes, exacerbated by the Grey Council's controversial decision to end the war with Earth without telling the warrior caste why they were ordered to surrender at the eve of victory, go a long way toward explaining the Warrior Caste's behavior during the Shadow crisis: they felt betrayed and manipulated by the Religious Caste, and weren't about to let the same thing happen again. Instead, they focused on trying to wrestle political power away from the Religious Caste, and started a Minbari civil war in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> The Narn are this, though mostly by necessity. It's mentioned in-series that before the Centauri occupied Narn, the Narn were a deeply spiritual agrarian people with some Proud Warrior traits, but that the occupation brought the Proud Warrior part of Narn culture to prominence at the expense of all others.
<ul><li> The Narn are a particularly nuanced case. Pretty much every Narn with any screen time is shown to be a fierce fighter, including and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">G'Kar</a> — but it's far from the only thing they care about, and we rarely meet any Narn with a boilerplate "stoic warrior" personality. They're not proud of being warriors because they're naturally soldierly or because it's their designated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a>, but because, within living memory, they shook off a 100-year occupation by the vastly technologically superior Centauri through a bloody insurrection, and they're not keen to let anyone forget the accomplishment or the grievance.
</li></ul></li><li> Befitting their status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from the Narn, the Centauri themselves. Most of the time they're seen politicking and partying, so it's easy to forget that their military consists of <em>every single male Centauri of age</em> (including the slaves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">though those are mobilized only when things are going horribly bad</a>), or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">their civilization during the First Empire had completely renounced to war</a> until the Xon, the other sentient race of their homeworld, attacked without provocation on first contact and shattered the defenseless First Empire only for the Centauri to form what would become the Noble Houses, rally around them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">use their technological superiority and better organization to slaughter them</a>. Tellingly, all prominent Centauri characters are extremely dangerous:
<ul><li> Ambassador Londo Mollari is usually jovial and friendly, if heavily depressed due his career sinking at some point in the past. He's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> with plenty of combat experience and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> known as "Paso Liati" (that is Centauri for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">fights like a madman</a>), and according to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">the ability to go berserk on a whim but still use proportionate force is an important part of being a Centauri ambassador</a>.
</li><li> Vir Cotto, Londo's attache, is meek and calm. At one point, a Drazi (a Proud Warrior Race Guy) put a bug in his grocery and humiliated him when called out, so Vir went to Londo's apartment, borrowed one of his swords, hacked to pieces the Drazi's stand, and <em>forced</em> him to kneel and beg for forgiveness. Londo decided he was ready for promotion.
</li></ul></li><li> The Drazi aren't the most advanced race of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, but are the most powerful because of how much they praise martial ability, and during the Dilgar War they were the only ones who held back the invasion until Earth Alliance turned the tide-everyone else had to wait for EarthForce to lift the siege on their homeworlds, but the Drazi were close to the border and ready to launch their own offensive at first convenience.
</li><li> The Rogolon from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> type: they're fixated with duels and consider active protection as dishonorable (armor is OK, but dodging is not), and as a result they fight wars by sending out their fleet to challenge their enemies in a long series of duels, with the side winning most duels winning the battle, and their ship are unique in lacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">interception ability</a>. As a result, when the Centauri invaded during the Centauri-Orieni War to bypass Orieni defenses, the brave but already technologically inferior Rogolon were slaughtered by the Centauri veterans who wasted no time in picking on isolated ships that refused to dodge attacks or shoot down incoming fire, and the Rogolon remained independent only because the Centauri had bigger things to worry at the moment and after the war were too busy rebuilding to spare the forces necessary.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> There are some indications that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Castithans</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Defiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Defiance">Defiance</a></em> are, in part, this. Viceroy Mercado, an Earth Republic official, even claims at one point that the Castithans have conquered the homeworld of the Irathients, the Sensoths, and the Liberata, colonizing it and renaming it "Casti" (this contradicts earlier sources, which claim that Casti used to be a barren rock until terraformed by the Indogene and that Irath is a separate planet). The Viceroy also claims that humans need to learn to coexist and emulate the Castithans, lest our planet is also conquered by them. Some of the typical attitude associated with this trope is shown in one of the early episodes, where a cowardly Castithan runs away from a battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">Datak Tarr</a> has him put on a rack of sorts in a public place, where other Castithans put rocks onto a plate that increases the torture. The punishment is meant to cleanse the guilt of cowardice (the alternative is death).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has its fair share of Proud Warrior Races.
<ul><li> Most of these Proud Warrior Races are villainous (when your hero is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a>, who <em>else</em> would his enemies be?) and are usually among the Doctor's <em>least</em> powerful enemies. They are almost always outmatched by ordinary human soldiers when it comes down to a straight-up fight, especially in the renewed series. Villainous examples include the Sycorax and <em>especially</em> the Sontarans, who view everything as part of the war effect and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious">take everything with military seriousness:</a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Strax:</strong> I can produce <em>magnificent</em> quantities of lactic fluids!
</div></li><li> More heroic examples include:
<ul><li> An allied Proud Warrior Race <em>Girl</em> in Leela, who combined this trope nicely with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">Amazonian Beauty</a>.
</li><li> King Yrcanos (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBlessed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBlessed">BRIAN BLESSED</a>!) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS23E2Mindwarp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS23E2Mindwarp">"Mindwarp"</a> is a more positive example of a Proud Warrior Race Guy than the ones listed above; he is slightly ludicrous in his constant blustering but mostly on the side of right. (But that was only because the story in question had a major case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>: in many more optimistic <em>Doctor Who</em> stories Yrcanos would have been a bloodthirsty villain by comparison to nicer characters.)
</li><li> The Draconians, who are entirely honourable, although the Master <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the Daleks</span> are trying to push them into war with the humans.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ice Warriors are more morally nuanced — individual ones can be anywhere on the scale from sadistic schemer to purely honorable warrior, and their culture in general has gone through both aggressive and more neighbourly (while remaining this trope) periods during its history.
</li><li> The Stenza are a subversion — they promote themselves as this but are actually cruel, treacherous and hypocritical.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>:
<ul><li> D'Argo (who also parodies this trope in a Season four episode by remarking, "You know, I've never put this into words... but I <em>love</em> shooting stuff. And I'm very good at it.")
</li><li> The powers behind <em>Farscape</em> encouraged Anthony Simcoe (D'Argo) to subvert this archetype at every opportunity, <em>even excluding</em> the various whacky/gay D'Argos from the various mind-screw episodes. D'Argo was basically an inexperienced teenage father when he was imprisoned. He consciously struggles with his own violent impulses, only ever really wanted to just earn his honor in battle and then settle down, become a farmer and grow wine. He had a sense of humor and grew to appreciate human culture, while becoming cynical of certain aspects of his own culture. He also was elected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain of his ship</a> by the last season, which acknowledged how he had outgrown his immaturity.
</li><li> Further subverts the archetype in one of the episodes in which the crew lands on earth. A police officer discovers them on Halloween however Noranti saves the day by drugging him with a powder which causes him to imagine D'Argo taking of his 'mask' to reveal the obligatory large African American (or Australian in this case).
</li><li> Furthermore, Luxans as a whole subvert one fairly standard cliche of this trope: they do not have an obsession with dying honorably in battle. They accept it as a possibility, but it seems fairly clear that, all other things being equal, they'd rather die of old age. They are overall closer to the Proud Soldier Race sub-type, since the values they seek to embody are not personal glory and deadliness but rather loyalty and self-sacrifice for the good of others. A big part of this is that young Luxan males can easily go into a blinding rage when stressed, and this continues well into the age where they enter military service. Establishing the discipline and emotional control needed to control them is a necessary step in being accepted as a full adult, and Proud Warrior berserker shenanigans are seen as childish.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Peacekeepers</a> are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a> with a habit of conquering their clients. They were created by a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> as guardians and have interpreted their purpose to be "peace at the muzzle of a weapon". They have no respect for "techs" as they spend all their time fixing and building weapons instead of using them. They are taught not to befriend one another or have close relations with family, and their children are taken to be raised in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a> shortly after birth. Ex-Peacekeeper officer Aeryn Sun tends to retain many of the attitudes when not denying her heritage.
</li><li> Even John Crichton has commented on humans' battle prowess, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> might explain why the Eidelons used them to create the Peacekeepers</span>.
</li><li> Deconstructed by the Halosians, a race of bird-like creatures whose entire culture is based around gaining more power by racking up kills. In practice, this means that they just go around attacking anyone they meet, which usually results in them getting their asses handed to them by more powerful opponents, and leaves them unable to consider <em>not</em> attacking even when it's in their best interest.

To them, any man who cannot ride is no man at all, and a dead khal is succeeded only by the strongest warrior(s) among his followers.
</li><li> The ironborn take pride in being reavers. Traditionally, they do not wear jewelry not won in battle and prefer raiding to siegecraft and seamanship to horsemanship. The Greyjoy words, "We Do Not Sow", brag that they live by plunder rather than labour. Although they're seen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of the Seven Kingdoms, they are still fearsome warriors and unparalleled in the seafaring arts, despite their other failings. Stannis even admits in the History and Lore videos that individually they're the strongest warriors in Westeros and the only reason his victory over them was possible was because despite their naval superiority, they're too individualistic to fight cohesively as a group, which allowed him to destroy their proud Iron Fleet at Fair Isle during the Greyjoy Rebellion.

</li><li> From the crannogmen in the Neck to the Umbers of Last Hearth, Northmen have this reputation throughout Westeros. This was mostly taken as rumor before the War of Five Kings, as every time Northerners met an enemy outside of their homeland they repeatedly underestimate the Northerners and are crushed.

<ul><li> Jaime, Tywin and Varys all observe that the Northerners have shades of this and Ned's one them.

He was raised as the son of a Scottish clan chief, in a society where clan battles were common and men were raised to fight. He doesnt usually go looking for fights, given that immortals try not to attract the attention of other immortals, but hes hard wired to protect and fight against evil immortals and often has ended up in historical wars fighting, as he told Darius, battles he believed to be just. He considered Darius a good friend but trying to follow Dariuss peaceful teachings didnt last very long.

Though they fit the attitudes of the trope, they're not exactly members of warrior races. Teyla's people are agrarian nomads, Teyla fights because she's their leader and protector. Ronon's homeworld of Sateda appears to have been roughly equivalent to middle-to-late 20th Century Earth before it was destroyed, with no real indication it was run by the military. The reason Ronon and the other surviving Satedans are so badass is simply because they were all soldiers. Likewise Ronon's comment about being taught to shoot a triple-barrelled shotgun as a child by his grandfather, if he was being serious, is not so much an indication that Satedans have a military culture, but he's just comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">Badass Family</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>
<ul><li> Klingons generally fit this but when you come to inviduals, the picture is closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Playing with a Trope</a>.
<ul><li> The importance of honor in Klingon culture changed over time. Klingons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> and in the associated movies, who are mostly filling the role of designated Federation antagonist, aren't hesitant about winning through guile or outright deceit (the Organian peace caused direct warfare to be less of an option, in any case). The concept of an honorable warrior is a cultural ideal, not a universal cultural truth. The main source of information on Klingon society, Worf — an orphan, raised in a radically different culture from his own, and an officer in a generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> military — idealizes and glorifies his original culture. Time and again, we see that Worf is a paragon of Klingon virtue. Nearly every other powerful Klingon fails to live up to that standard of honor.
</li><li> Worf is widely considered to be the most uptight, traditional, and humorless Klingon alive. Most other Klingons are much more easygoing and rarely feel bound to follow traditions, and while they still tend to be rough and proud, they can be quite fun and welcoming people to be around. Once, when Worf's humorlessness came up, he said "Klingons do not laugh", but Guinan said that <em>Klingons</em> laugh plenty, it's <em>Worf</em> that doesn't. Some of this is because Worf was raised by human foster parents. Though they tried their best to accommodate and encourage him, it could be that his books on Klingon culture had some things wrong, or he's just trying way too hard to be "a true Klingon." (His uptight nature, at least, is later explained as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">accidentally killing a childhood friend</a> during a soccer game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">which led him to keep his emotions on a short leash afterward</a>.)
</li><li> Worf's son Alexander is also a unique example of a Klingon in that he is less of one than his father.
</li><li> Martok and Worf's brother Kurn are one of the few truly righteous Klingon authority figures. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kurn's time as a powerful Klingon is short-lived, after Gowron expels him from the High Council and essentially blacklists him. However, even afterwards, he continues to attempt to live honorably, refusing to commit suicide because of its accompanying dishonor.</span>
</li><li> Duras and Chancellor Gowron go to great lengths to prove that the Klingons are as dishonorable and sneaky as ever.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> with Klingon-human hybrid B'Elanna Torres, who thinks Klingon culture is over-rated and blames it for everything that went wrong in her life. She does however become more accepting of her heritage over the course of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reconstructed</a> this one all in the same episode. "Judgement" had Captain Archer being tried for crimes against the Klingon Empire in an homage of <em>Star Trek VI</em> (same courtroom set!) What set the episode apart is a lengthy discussion Archer had with his counsellor about the nature of honor and glory among Klingons. His counsellor explained that the society originally encouraged other honorable professions such as doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc., but that the culture eventually shifted towards a glory-obsessed warrior base. "Kill something, whether it be strong or weak, it didn't matter, then we go to the bar and gloat about our conquest." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not only did Archer get a life sentence, the counsellor was given a short prison term for speaking out. Archer was rescued, but the counsellor stayed to serve his sentence so he could peacefully try to change the culture.</span> It isn't that being a warrior is bad; it's when being a warrior becomes <em>everything</em> that trouble occurs.
</li><li> A <em>Deep Space 9</em> episode also showed a proud Klingon lawyer, who treats every case as if it were a genuine battle. He uses every trick in the book (but still goes by said book) to win, as he believes a warrior must, but the cause itself is meaningless to him. As he's working to convict Worf of the accidental murder of a shipful of civilians, he explains that he would then happily defend him on Qo'noS.
</li></ul></li><li> The Andorians are another Proud Warrior Race (they have a duel-to-the-death ritual called Ushaan), and the Romulans have some shades of this (although they often balance "honor" with being sneaky, devious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a>). (In <em>TOS</em>, the Romulans were the honour-and-glory obsessed Vikings In Space, while the Klingons were the sneaky, backstabbing bastards — they switched characterization for some reason between then and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>.) And as Quark observes (and Kirk once acknowledged), even humans (who insist they've outgrown all that) can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">downright savage</a> at times. Put it this way, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TrekVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TrekVerse">Trek Verse</a> has a <em>lot</em> of Proud Warrior Races.
</li><li> To elaborate further on the Romulans, they are more of a Proud Soldier Race, given their disciplined and strict way of life. However, they must have been a Proud Warrior Race in the distant past (possibly as far back as when they were still living on Vulcan) because some Romulans still continue the tradition of sword fighting (e.g. Nero and his men in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>) and duels (e.g. Tenqem Adrev initiated one against Picard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard">Star Trek: Picard</a></em>, and there are several Romulans carrying swords at North Station on Vashti). The Qowat Milat sisterhood is a relic from that era, being an order of warrior nuns who preach the Way of Absolute Candor and who may choose to bind their sword to a quest that they deem to be worthy (i.e. a lost cause).
</li><li> Ferengi:
<ul><li> Ironically, the <em>Ferengi</em> started out as this: before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> set in, the Ferengi were portrayed as extremely greedy <em>warriors</em>, who would have no qualms about attacking and boarding the <em>Enterprise</em> if they think they can make money from it. Even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, those few Ferengi who are or have been military (Nog and Quark, respectively) are something to be feared (Quark tends to avoid battles and run whenever he can, but if he can't run... he's still a crack shot, and can break gold bricks <em>bare handed</em>), and the novels tend to remind us that the cowardly comical Ferengi are a <em>minority</em>, with the majority being able to kick ass whenever required.
</li><li> It's something that's easy to forget because Quark and his family are the main Ferengi in the franchise. Seen throughout TNG (even in the <em>later</em> seasons) and their one-off appearances in Voyager and Enterprise, Ferengi remain villains who are to be feared because being willing to do anything for profit means <em>anything.</em> There is a Klingon chef on Deep Space Nine who sings and plays the accordion and is never seen with a weapon; to mistake all Ferengi for being like Quark is like mistaking all Klingons for being like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Kaga</a>. (And like Quark, Kaga probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinoredInAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinoredInAsskicking">Minored in Ass-Kicking</a>.)
</li><li> The two-part novel <em>The Left Hand of Destiny</em> features a tall Ferengi named Pharh. While he's a typical profit-obsessed Ferengi, he also shows that he's willing to fight for those he considers his friends, even though he gets defensive when this is pointed out, claiming that he's only being motivated by profit. In this case, his willingness to fight by Martok's side is described by him as simply him making sure that Martok pays off the cost of Pharh's shuttle, which Martok wrecked. In the end, Pharh takes a disruptor bolt meant for Martok, and Martok honors his friend's memory in the most Ferengi way possible — by paying off the cost of the shuttle to Pharh's family (not to mention fighting a battle in his honor).
</li></ul></li><li> The Talarians, in the episode "Suddenly Human", are basically "I Can't Believe They're Not Klingons". They have similar martial traditions and concepts of honor. Interestingly, in an earlier episode, Klingon renegades were found aboard a Talarian ship. The Talarians even look like Klingons, with ridged scalps instead of foreheads.
</li><li> The Acamarians from "The Vengeance Factor" used to be this, but consider it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> now. There are, however, rebels against modern Acamarian society who now live as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Jem'Hadar</a> also fit the bill. They exist solely to fight for the Dominion and appear to follow a code of honour; although it was never as clearly laid out for the audience as the Klingons' was, it was implied to be similar as a Jem'Hadar First who fought Worf seemed to understand him. The Jem'Hadar know their masters can be cruel, unjust and unreasonable, but — like Klingons — once they've given their allegiance (and they're bred from birth to give allegiance to the Founders), they <em>will</em> honour it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Third</strong>: Until we re-establish communications, we will hold this world for the Dominion. <br/><strong>Fifth</strong>: And if we cannot re-establish communications? <br/><strong>Third</strong>: Then we will hold this world for the Dominion... until we die.
</div><ul><li> Another Jem'hadar example. In "By Inferno's Light", the Jem'hadar basically line up to fight Worf in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>. He kills several of them, but once he gets to the First he is worn out and unable to win. He is knocked down time and time again, but refuses to stay down. The Jem'hadar then <em>yields</em> to him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ikat'ika</strong>: I yield. I cannot defeat this Klingon. All I can do is kill him. And that no longer holds my interest.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Also from <em>Deep Space Nine</em> are the Breen. Before the war, pretty much all that was known about them was that a Klingon armada that invaded their space was lost with no word; once allied with the Dominion, their forces were at the front of every battle by their own insistence.
</li><li> The Hirogen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> are more of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">Proud Hunter Race</a>", and the more cunning the prey, the more they enjoy the hunt. Being called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">worthy prey</a>" is the highest compliment one can receive from them. One Hirogen character laments that it's effectively destroyed their culture; they basically don't have a civilization beyond roving hunting parties anymore.
</li><li> The Kazon from the same show desperately <em>want</em> to be this trope, but they push it so far that it comes off as parody. For instance they're so honor-bound that their prisons are just a line on the ground they tell you not to cross; on more than one occasion the heroes escaped them by just walking away. They also suffer from being so low-tech compared to every other space faring race that they're really only a threat to each other.

In Book 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GestaDanorum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GestaDanorum">Gesta Danorum</a></em>, Starkad agrees to help Helge in a single combat against nine brothers. On the appointed day, Helge oversleeps and Starkad is too proud to wake him, so he goes to the combat alone. His nine opponents offer Starkad to attack him one by one, but he rudely tells them to come at him all at once. Starkad kills all nine, but is severely wounded so he is forced to wait for random passersby to help him. One by one, a sheriff, a free man married to another man's slave, and a slave woman with a baby to feed offer to bandage his wounds, but are refused because Starkad considers it beneath him to get his life saved by them. Finally there comes a peasant laborer, son of a laborer, whom Starkad considers worthy to be his rescuer.

The two craft worlds seek to reassert the Eldar as the masters of the galaxy and travel around attacking the upstarts squatting on their planets. Even Eldar in civilian occupations often take to battle as Guardians, and unlike most citizen militia who are fielded out of desperation, the vast majority of Guardians have experience from a warrior path and can hold their own against the trained armies of other races.

The vast majority of Dark Eldar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject">male and female</a>, serve as grunts in kabals, but there are also several warrior sects within Dark Eldar society, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">Wyches</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Incubi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker">Reavers</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Scourges</a>.
</li><li> The Tau Fire Caste might qualify, being an entire group raised from birth for combat and having strong martial discipline, but in contrast to the other races they are somewhat of a subversion of the archetype. For example, they attribute no dishonor to a sensible strategic retreat, and consider a "glorious last stand" to be the last resort of an inept commander. They do have pride and honor, just of a form unusual in the setting. Put into perspective: Imperial Guardsmen usually get their training around their teens. Tau Fire Warriors train constantly to become warriors, starting from childhood, and are expressibly forbidden from entering any other vocation. Fire Warriors never retire and fight until they die, although Shas'O generals are eventually presented with retirement, but are still expected to serve as military advisers.
</li><li> This trope also fits Chaos to a degree. Just about every cultist, daemon, traitor guardsman or marine see going to war in the name of Chaos as one of the highest forms of worship. Although it's arguable to what extent exactly each Chaos warband fits this trope, such as there only being shades of it with the servants of scheming Tzeentch, hedonistic Slaanesh, and pestulant Nurgle. Chaos Undivided seems to fit the trope more than those three, but the followers of Khorne are the kings of this trope as far as Chaos goes. And are also the kings of this trope for the whole setting, really. Their God, whom they strive to emulate, has the title of the <em>Brass Lord of Battle</em> for God's sake. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
</li><li> Their new codex turns the Necrons into this.

Abhorash goes inside, kills the dragon in a 1-on-1 duel, and drinks it's blood; to his surprise, his bloodthirst never came back, but he retained his vampire powers. And so, he commanded his followers to go out and find worthy opponents to slay in the hopes of curing their bloodthirst, and when they were all done, that they then return to him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing">so the real war could begin</a>.

<ul><li> The Aslan and the Sword Worlders are this. The Aslan are creatures that look like lions to humans, and have a stern code of honor. All male Aslan are theoretically warriors and most useful occupations are done by women. If someone does a designated female occupation they are considered female in Aslan language. More easily understood by the fact that only 1/3 of Aslan are male. Sword Worlders are humans that admire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Germanic warriors of yore</a> and think in a manner remarkably similar to Aslan, though men are allowed to actually work. This could cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">embarrassment</a> if an Aslan is surprised that the engineer of a passing Sworld Worlder ship is male.

The two prominent Dragon-Blooded cultures are the Realm and Lookshy, and both are of the Proud Soldier Race varient. Lookshy is strongly militaristic and requires all of its Dragon-Blooded to receive extensive military training, including charms (magical abilities) useful on the battlefield.

<ul><li> The Gormoror are in many ways a parodic exaggeration of this. They mostly live in small tribes on the edges of civilization, and they're obsessed with a Bronze Age sense of honor focused mostly on fighting grand battles and performing mighty deeds. They occupy most of their time with living out their personal heroic legends, generally by challenging one another to dramatic duels, fighting monsters or rival tribes, swearing and keeping honor-oaths, or raiding and sacking other species' settlements for treasure and the glory of killing a few farmers, stealing their stuff and hightailing it before the army arrives.
</li><li> The Cyarr are highly militaristic, expansionistic and devoted to their personal ideals of honor. They're in a state of constant war, either hot or cold, with the primes, for the sake of honor, revenge for past slights, and territory, and are ruled by warrior-nobilities who hold themselves to incredibly strict moral standards. This lifestyle presents something of an issue for them, however, as they have no access to healing or metal-shaping magic, which gives them serious disadvantages in protracted battles and campaigns — the associated gods plain don't like them and deny these gifts to the Cyarr.

However, a few races have this trope invoked in-universe:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>. A race of Men, they exemplify the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humans Are Warriors</a>. It took a mere 500 of their best warriors to annihilate the entire Falmer (Snow Elves) civilization. Being a great warrior is even at the heart of their religion, where only those who die a glorious death in combat get into their ideal afterlife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Sovngarde</a> (modeled after the real life Valhalla). While most Nords follow the main religion of most of Tamriel (the Nine Divines), many hold Talos, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">ascended god form</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Emperor Tiber Septim</a> and God of War, as the chief deity of the pantheon. When worship of Talos is banned in the 4th Era, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus">launches them into a bloody civil war</a>, as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollSVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollSVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>. This has also led to them having a disdain for magic (that and magic's association with the Falmer) though Healing is held in high regard (no surprise) and despite them looking down on it, they're still happy to buy potions and magically-enhanced weapons. A character reveals this is a recent phenomenon, as the Nords considered magic (called the Clever Craft) as part of their warrior traditions.
</li><li> The Redguards, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">dark-skinned</a> race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Men</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey">a cultural mix</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays">Moors, Arabs</a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSamurai">Samurai</a></em>, make for some of the greatest warriors in Tamriel, and are perhaps <em>the</em> most skilled individual warriors. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Swords and swordsmanship</a> hold a high value in Redguard culture, to the point where the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredScripture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredScripture">Sacred Scripture</a> of their race is a treatise on <em>sword techniques</em>. Their greatest ancient warriors, known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">Ansei or "Sword Saints"</a>, could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousWeaponCreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousWeaponCreation">summon swords made from their very souls, known as Shehai</a>, and the greatest of those could use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Fantastic Nuke</a> known as the "Pankratosword", in which they would use their swords to "cut the atomos." In the late 2nd Era, it was believed that a Redguard uprising was the greatest threat to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Tiber Septim</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Rising Empire</a>. Come the 4th Era, they are once again considered one of the only groups who could stand up to a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a> assault, something they have already repelled once after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> ceded much of Hammerfell to the Dominion and the Redguards refused to accept it.
</li><li> In keeping with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humans Are Warriors</a> theme, there are the Imperials, another race of Men native to Cyrodiil. They come down on the "Soldier" side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVersusWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVersusWarrior">Soldier Versus Warrior</a> debate in contrast to the "Warrior" Nords and Redguards. Their focus is on collective martial prowess, ala the legions of the Roman Empire, and it has allowed them to conquer most or all of Tamriel no fewer than four times. They are also a proud "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreDiplomats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreDiplomats">Diplomat</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Merchant</a>" race, in that once they've conquered a region with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Legions</a>, they like to build up the region to make it more supportive of the Empire while dominating the economy through trade.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a>. Also known as Orsimer (Pariah Folk), their culture believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>, leading to plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotions</a> and many Orcs being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a>. Their racial ability leads to them being fantastic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Berserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Berserker">Berserkers</a>, capable of flying into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>. The Septim Empire was the first to recruit them into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Imperial Legions</a>, benefiting greatly as the Orcs made for fantastic heavy "shock" infantry. They are also a race of incredibly skilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith">Blacksmiths</a>, making some of the sturdiest weapons and armor in Tamriel.
</li><li> The Dunmer (Dark Elves) of Morrowind, being one of the series' best examples of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> race, offer many examples through their "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Great Houses</a>". Great House Redoran is the "Warrior House" of the Dunmer, following a strict code of honor and highly valuing martial prowess in its members. They are the Dunmer's first line of defense and even the Imperial Legions recognize the Redorans as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a>. In the backstory, when Tiber Septim was threatening to invade Morrowind, House Redoran was preparing to defend Morrowind <em>on their own</em> while the other Great Houses chose to remain neutral or to accommodate the empire before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal">the armistice</a> was signed. Following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Red</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano">Year</a> and subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">invasion</a> early in the 4th era, it was the Redorans who stepped up to lead the defense of Morrowind and rebuild the Dunmer way of life after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Great House Hlaalu</a>, formerly the strongest Great House, crumbled.
</li><li> The Dremora, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">lesser Daedra</a>, are very much one of these. They are constantly obsessed with honor through combat, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">strongest of their race rise into leadership positions</a>. They are frequently found in service to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Destruction</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity">Mehrunes Dagon</a>, whom they serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell">Legions of Hell</a>, and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a> who seek out the toughest foes. While they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">generally look down on mortals</a>, they will consider any who can best them in combat to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, the Aureals (aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Golden Saints</a>) and Mazken (aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsnotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsnotEvil">Dark Seducers</a>), two forms of lesser Daedra in service to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Sheogorath</a>, are these as well. Each has a heavily militaristic society, thriving on conflict and warfare. They are known to engage in conflicts with each other for both the favor of Sheogorath and simply as an outlet for their aggression.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> reveals that the Dragons (Dov or Dovah) have this type of culture. Due to the urge for conquest and domination being an inherent trait within their species, whenever two Dragons meet, one will naturally try to dominate the other. This is part of the reason (aside from outright fear) why most Dragons have a tendency to attack the Dragonborn on sight. The belief that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">strongest should lead them</a> is why so many follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Alduin</a> and why so many of his underlings begin to question his right to rule when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">flees</a> during battle with the Dragonborn, since a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">true</a></em> Dovah would keep fighting until their death, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonourBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonourBeforeReason">rather than admit defeat</a>.

The beorc are allegedly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace">Proud Scholar Race</a> in contrast, but they tend just be warriors with more technical weapons, some as strong or stronger than their Laguz counterparts.

In fact, most depictions of Sparta (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>) tend to have them (at least their ruling class, the Spartiates) as a city-state of proud warrior guys.

This might be because most of the Protoss characters encountered and played in the game are members of the Protoss' warrior-caste (The Templar), StarCraft being a war game. Members of the civilian/artisan/scientist/laborer caste (the Khalai) and the clergy/government caste (the Judicators) justifiably don't make much of an appearance.
<ul><li> The few Judicator characters tend to act like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a>, their tribes were nearly wiped out in the first game. While Phasesmith Karax, the only member of the Khalai caste to appear in any of the games, acts more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy">Proud Scholar Race Guy</a>, though that might just be him.

Their philosophy/culture is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Darwinian on the principle of survival of the fittest</a>. Their entire society basically operates around constantly fighting and killing each other so they can evolve and grow stronger.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> has the disciplined Turians and the thuggish Krogans.
<ul><li> The Krogan are actually a rather brilliant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of the trope. They place very little emphasis on research or industry if it doesn't have to directly do with fighting, and likewise, there are very few merchants in their society. Because of their complete lack of aptitude for anything other than war after they were uplifted, the Krogan once threatened to conquer the galaxy, causing the other races to ally against them, and eventually they had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">Depopulation Bomb</a> used on them that sharply limited their birth rate. Unfortunately, the Krogan warrior culture did not go quietly into the night. Though they would still be able to hold a stable population if they tried, none of them want to stay at home and help rebuild their race — instead, they've become a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seekers</a> who hire themselves out as mercenaries, dooming their race to a slow extinction. It is even highlighted in the Codex: Krogan live with the mantra: "kill, pillage, and be selfish, for tomorrow we die". It's a great example of how a purely warrior culture with no room for any other societal roles would have serious trouble surviving.
</li><li> However, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2">sequel</a>, conditions may have improved provided that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wrex survived the first game.</span> If so, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you find that he fought and browbeat his way to the top of Krogan society between games, and is now running a truce zone between the various clans.</span> Curiously, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> this can develop into practically a full-blown schism between those who, like Wrex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Eve</span>, emphasize the <em>proud</em> (and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">race</a></em>, if necessary), and those who, like Wreav, emphasize the <em>warrior</em>. This leads to one of the more bizarre sights in the game: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech">Patrick Stewart Speech</a> delivered <em>by a krogan</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And, armed with the ultimate bargaining chip (the genophage cure), <em>it works</em></span>.
</li><li> On the other hand, the turians, with their focus on discipline and authority, are Proud Soldier Race Guys. They have a regimented meritocratic society that requires a term of military service to advance beyond the first tier of citizenship. They tend to be bad at entrepreneurship, though, so they had to take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">volus</a> as a client race. They have a more pragmatic approach to combat as well; preferring long range superiority; less focus on hand to hand and more on squad firing tactics, and the most dreadnoughts (long range monsters of warships) than any other member of the Citadel. And they're not above leveling a city block from orbit to get one enemy squad if they have orbital superiority.
</li><li> Some of the other races see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humanity as this</a>, since their debut on the galactic society scene was the "First Contact War", where they managed to hold their own against the Turian military for three months before the ceasefire was called. The Turians in particular were astonished to learn afterwards that only 3% of their eligible population choose to serve in the military, far less than any other council race. With the rapid and aggressive expansions they've made since then, many council races have come to consider Humanity to be a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant">sleeping giant</a>".
</li><li> And, coming as a bit of a shock to Liara, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors">Protheans</a> were what happens when you give a krogan the ability to think in the long term and removed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingRelic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingRelic">Javik</a>.

</li><li> The Drell may also qualify, as they are a client race of the jellyfish-like Hanar who they handle the more physical tasks for. Though they are more of a proud assassin race.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a> 2</em> gives us a total of three species of Proud Warrior Race Guy: the thuggish Thraddash, the vaguely Scottish Yehat and the vaguely Japanese Shofixti. The Thraddash regularly lose centuries of achievement in determining what the strongest Culture is.
</li><li> The Canaanites and the Barcid family are this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TearsToTiara2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TearsToTiara2">Tears to Tiara 2</a></em>, exemplified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor">Monomachus</a>. Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Hamilicar Barca</a>, the last of the Barcids.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Sangheili/Elites play up the "Proud" aspects of this trope. Heck, the scientific name for the Sangheili is given as "Macto Cognatus", which means "I glorify my kin" in Latin. In particular, their portrayal in the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheColeProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheColeProtocol">Halo: The Cole Protocol</a></em> takes this to extremes; think of Imperial Japan on crack.
<ul><li> How proud are the Elites you say? Many of them die because they ran out of ammo and refused to use a human weapon, even if it was better than what they had...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">so instead, they just rushed the human front.</a>
</li><li> The Sangheili sense of honor is a little skewed, by human standards. While most warrior cultures view battle scars as badges of honor, the Sangheili view them as symbols of <em>shame</em>. Being wounded by an enemy is considered to be dishonorable. A true warrior is able to walk out of a battle without any wounds whatsoever. Sangheili also believe that blood should <em>only</em> be shed in proper combat; as a result, they tend to really hate doctors. The future Arbiter Thel 'Vadam remembers in <em>The Cole Protocol</em> that when he was younger and suffered an injury in the training ring grievous enough to require medical attention, his family had the incident and the resulting trip to the physician hushed up out of fear of what it would do to his reputation if word got out.
</li><li> As shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em> and related media, the Elites of the Arbiter's Swords of Sanghelios are starting to move away from this; they're still quite proud, but many of them are more earnestly pursuing non-warrior pursuits. The Arbiter is even trying to get rid of his people's disdain towards doctors.
</li></ul></li><li> Also the Jiralhanae/Brutes, for the "psycho klingon" side of this trope; they're very much a "might makes right" race who take joy in literally eating their enemies. Think the Turian/Krogan side presented in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> entry.
</li><li> In post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> media like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands">Halo: Glasslands</a></em>, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a>. Now that the Covenant has fallen and the Elites don't have the Prophets to rule them and the Engineers to build/fix stuff for them, their society is having to do some serious reorganization as they try to remember how to self-govern and have a self-sufficient military. It's implied that something similar is happening to the Brutes, many of whom are having an even harder time dealing with it. As said by <em>Glasslands</em>'s main Sangheili character Jul 'Mdama, "It's easier to vaporize a planet from orbit than to build a society from scratch". Another comments that "You can't expect warriors to stop fighting", in regards to a rebellion they're organizing. Jul also struggles with the whole underhandedness of the rebellion, as it involves lying and treachery when he'd rather run screaming at something with his sword. As hinted above, the Sangheili do adapt pretty quickly; many factions are now able to design their own technology, and Jul himself becomes by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> a ruthless pragmatist more than willing to resort to "dishonorable" means.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">four-armed</a> Shokan race from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a>, particularly Sheeva from MK3.

</li><li> Their rivals, the Centaurs, as well; their blood feud was what sparked Sheeva's chest-beating in MK3, and when the Centaurs were cursed with a minotaur/satyr body in <em>Armageddon</em>, their vanity over the loss of their back legs was what caused them to accuse the Shokan of the deed, restarting their war.

However, they do have a highly developed sense of honour in society — a better way of putting this would be a Proud Warrior Race whose 'honour concept' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">is very different from that of humans</a>, who the Tarka consider to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture">Martyrdom Culture</a>.
<div class="indent">"The Tarka are degenerate and laugh at war, but the humans are sick and laugh at death."

The majority of fighters are male, and most of their males are stupid enough to go full "barbarian horde" if uncontrolled because most of them never get the necessary diet supplements to reach maturity. The upper officer cadre of each ship is thus occupied by the more rational females, with mature males in ultimate command (since the younger males will only follow an alpha).

Ostensibly, its ideological emphasis on military power is just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>, but what is shown of its culture in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelizations</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">in-game quotations</a> also qualifies this faction as a Proud Warrior Race. They take their Spartan "heritage" seriously in the novelization. Any child that is found to be too weak is taken outside and has his or her throat cut. The exception is Colonel Santiago's own son, who, while weak as a child, ends up leading the Spartans against the mindworms when he grows up.

<ul><li> Most of the Qunari come across as this to some extent or another; however, it's eventually revealed that most of the examples encountered are from the "Body of the Qun"—in other words, a warrior caste among <em>many</em> different castes. Much like other traditional Proud Warrior Race types, this caste believes deeply in honourable conduct and martial prowess, to the point that they value their swords as natural extensions of their souls. However, even the warriors aren't totally defined by this; instead, like all Qunari, they believe that everything has its absolute, unchanging place in the cosmic way of things, and theirs is to fight until the entire world embraces the philosophy of the Qun.
</li><li> And despite their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">dislike of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMagic">magic in general</a>, even <em>Saarebas</em> have their place in the Qun.

They value strength and prowess, but are very insistent that it be within the framework of a contract, and never given for free. There's a sidequest where the protagonist is able to save a Sura warrior from fatally flunking his trial of endurance, but he'll only accept help if she has been <em>hired</em> to rescue him  being rescued for non-financial motivations like pity or compassion would be so shameful he'd rather die.

<ul><li> The Prone are introduced as unintelligent thugs who kill whatever they're pointed at without question. Later in the story we learn that this is only half their race: the Cavern Clan are the ones you've been fighting, while the Tree Clan are much more friendly and readily make friends with humanity. While primitive, they are surprisingly reasonable and have a much deeper culture than just "War is good!" Even the Cavern Clan gets some characterization, when you meet one team of Cavern Prone who are <em>not</em> psychotic berserkers and are, again, quite personable.
</li><li> The Wrothians are much more technologically advanced, and emphasize the "Proud" aspect, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expies</a> of Japanese samurai. Most of their disputes are solved through ritual combat, but they are highly honorable, respectful of their opponents, and they absolutely <em>despise</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Ganglion</a>, whom they are forced to work for.

"The King" was the greatest champion on an entire planet of Proud Warrior Race Guys. When the Zin conquered their planet, he challenged Zinyak for his people's freedom, and proceeded to beat every challenge that was thrown his way.

One of their ship commanders even forces all fleets in a battle to commit to the end (i.e. no retreat is possible).
</li><li> The Honorbound Warriors AI type from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em>, which results from Fanatic Militarists with a spiritualist or egalitarian bent. Ordinarily, Militaristic AIs have no particular negative opinion of Pacifists; if their other ethos match closely enough, they may even become allies. Honorbound Warriors are unique in <em>hating</em> pacifism, willingly going out of their way to antagonize a species that professes anti-violence philosophies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">even if that species can and will defend itself if forced</a>.

Even empires which are several times stronger than them and could crush them easily.

Evil or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft">good</a>, they <em>are</em> excellent destroying things and quite enjoy it. Their cavalry even uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse">meat-eating nightmares</a>.
</li><li> Frostlings from the <em>Eternal Lords</em> are basically fantasy vikings, and also mammoth-riding ice-people. Like orcs, they aren't necessarily evil, but they fight well and quite enjoy raiding.
</li><li> The Warlord leader class can turn anyone, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">halflings</a>, into this. No matter what kind of people they have to work with, the Warlord can train them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">berserkers</a>, mounted cavalry, manticore riders, monster hunters, or a number of other elite martial units. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter">At the cost of magical ability</a>.

They respect martial values and skill above all other things — to them, military strength and individual combat prowess are the highest values civilization is measured by — and their society strongly reflects that. The Loroi Empire is an archetypal army with a nation: its civilian economy is almost entirely in place to support the military, and Loroi civilians have considerably less power and political clout than the warrior class, which is the one that runs the empire. Even in the military, influence is based on one's role in combat, if any — soldiers and pilots are broadly ranked above medics, diplomats and scientists in the Loroi army's complicated organization, while the highest government ranks — the Emperor and her chiefs of staff — are specifically the highest rungs in the space navy's command structure.

<ul><li> Dinobot, despite the fact that he's the only member of his race who acts that way. Nobody ever mentioned this on the show, though... Presumably, they knew better than to say so within earshot of Dinobot.
</li><li> Some of the other Predacons do have shades of this as well, but in a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> sort of way. Also, some incarnations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">the original Dinobots</a>, when they're not portrayed as either knuckle-dragging bufoons or completely animalistic.
</li><li> Don't forget that most of the Predacons we are part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Megatron's</a> crew, and only Dinobot (soldier) and Megatron (general) are true Pred military types. Other than that, we only see Ravage and the Tripredacus council.
</li><li> This is technically an anime, but in any case, Starscream was this in spades for "Transformers Armada" as well as in Energon and Cybertron.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em>, the denizes of Jungle Planet are like this. Their leader, Scourge, even owes a little of his design to Dinobot.
</li></ul></li><li> Hawkgirl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>. As we see in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, her idea of celebration involves starting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl">Bar Brawl</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a> are borderline cases. Basically, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are <em>royalty</em> from Proud Warrior Races, while Hawkgirl is a <em>warrior</em> from a Proud Warrior Race.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has Starfire and her fellow Tamaraneans, though as mentioned above, the TV version of Starfire herself is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">New Mandalorians</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> repeatedly emphasize that they <em>used</em> to be this, but have renounced such ways. Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla and his men, on the other hand, are determined to live up to their ancestors' legacy. After a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroics">Engineered Heroics</a> by Death Watch the general population solidly rejected pacifism and returned to the old ways en masse, both the join Death Watch and to fight them.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>, as Mandalore's infighting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">backstabbing</a> made it easy for the Empire to manipulate, divide, and exploit them until they were too scattered to fight back against the Empire, subjugating the entire culture save for a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">quislings</a> who became their lackeys in exchange for power. And even then, most of them are still too caught up in power struggles and old rivalries to form any sort of resistance. Sabine, one of the main characters and the most prominent Mandalorian, is proud of her heritage but also critical of its flaws. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her discovery of the darksaber, an artifact that would unite the Mandalorians, and her search to find the right person to wield it, indicates that things might be heading towards reconstruction.</span>

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E13HearthsWarmingEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E13HearthsWarmingEve">"Hearth's Warming Eve"</a>, the ancestors of the pegasi (a mish-mash of ancient Greek, Spartan, Roman, and conquistador imagery) are depicted as such a culture, exemplified by their domineering, militaristic leader Commander Hurricane, who even describes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion">his/her</a> people as "a mighty tribe of warriors". (And does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadEtte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadEtte">Rainbow</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Dash</a> <em>ever</em> play it up.) A large number of the pegasi with speaking parts in the present day also seem to be part of the military in some capacity, suggesting they haven't entirely shed this characterization.
<ul><li> The Dragons also tend towards this characterization, with all of them eager to show off their strength, reluctant to admit weakness, and obsessed with competition and dominance.
</li></ul></li><li> Most traditional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> are like this, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Goliath</a> being the most notable, showing himself to be both a powerful warrior and a deeply honorable individual. For a more antagonistic example, the Vikings from the first two episodes are a thoroughly unpleasant bunch lead by vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> Hakon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s Kzinti were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">imported</a> to the Trek universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a>.</em>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> universe, citizens of the Fire Nation are taught that the other three elements, water, air, and earth, are inferior to fire, and hold their users in lower esteem than firebenders. They are also a martial culture, where almost everyone serves in the military, and obedience to the state is taught in the national school curriculum. Although originally presented as villains in the show, it is later on revealed that firebenders are more nuanced and complicated. Regardless, they generally have short tempers and enjoy settling issues through combat.
<ul><li> It should be noted that, unlike other examples, they have a very rich culture that does not focus 100% on war, and most likely after 100 years of war their culture has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">become much more belligerent</a>.
</li><li> The Water Tribes are also a culture based around warrior-hood. When a tribesman comes of age, they go through a series challenges to prove themselves warriors. Sokka himself underwent this rite of passage and proved himself.
</li><li> In the first few episodes, this actually seemed to be Sokka's defining trait, though it was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">overshadowed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">others</a>. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>'s own admission, his personality changed for the better due to Jack De Sena's voice acting.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em> episode "Win, Lose and Kaboom", features an Orc-like race called Gorlocks. Jimmy and one of them fall in love with each other.
</li><li> The Iop race from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> has a rather scrap-happy culture, to the point that even the deity for which their race was named liked duking out matters on the mortal plane so much that it decided to stay there as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">physical incarnation</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who, as it turns out, was Sadlygrove in this particular incarnation</span>. Iops in general are often derided by the other races for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">all brawn and no brain</a>, and they tend to be delighted to find themselves in fights even when the odds are stacked suicidally against them. Adding to this, the fact that Sadlygrove <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">proposed to Eva with a set of engagement <em>knuckledusters</em></span> seems to place another layer of cultural significance to the Iops' boisterousness. Come Season 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elely, Sadlygrove and Eva's daughter</span> proved to be a physical powerhouse in and of herself, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass">very young child</a>. Of course, how much of this is down to her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">divine heritage</span> is up to debate, though, either way, it's pretty clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">she takes very much after her father</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Omicronians are basically the shows parody of the Klingons. While they do invade planets, they are willing to reason with others. Lrrr especially fits this as seen in "Spanish Fry" when its revealed that he had a soft spot for small creatures and was willing to protect a bigfoot animal from a camp ranger. Their culture is basically built around the idea of war and have traits similar to Spartans.
</li><li> The Carcarons are also a proud warrior race. They like the omicronians, have an honor filled warlike culture and are also willing to reason with others. Their members only got angry and turned hostile when Zapp Brannigan tried to screw them over on a peace treaty by tricking them into signing a declaration of war.
