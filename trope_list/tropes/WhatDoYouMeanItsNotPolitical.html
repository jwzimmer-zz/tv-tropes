In a boom, you see, the hoarding of gold is more likely to be considered to be a harmless eccentricity, even something desirable, and dragons are noble and nice. But in a recession, when everyone hates the people with all the money, then dragons are villains. Examples: Smaug is the archetypal asshole dragon, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a> was written in the Great Depression.</em>

The following are seemingly apolitical topics that may be interpreted as political due to the "culture wars" of recent decades.
</p><ul><li> Anything involving queer sexuality/identity, and whether it's depicted positively or negatively <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00gq4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note00gq4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00gq4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Note that this doesn't even have to be about sex per se, and can apply to any analysis of "manly" or "girly" characters and behaviors. </span>

</li><li> Anything about killing animals, and whether that's okay
</li><li> Any depiction of a culture that's more than a little different from the culture producing the work, and whether that culture is "superior" or "inferior"
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Any out-of-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Race Lift</a>, at least if one of the two races is the majority race within the culture that produced the work
</li></ul><p>Also note that only rarely is this analysis laudatory. Nine times out of ten, the critic is repulsed by the supposed moral/philosophical/social/whatever point a work is making, and uses their argument to condemn the author. This can even result in a sort of premortem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a> if the critic claims that <em>everything</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bulverism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bulverism">in the work arises from subconscious attitudes the author may or may not have</a> (a possible side effect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAuteurTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAuteurTheory">''auteur'' theory</a>). The argument might even be applied to an entire society of a particular time and place, with the implication that because the audience enjoyed something <em>as entertainment</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">they must have applied its values to their daily lives as well</a>.
</p><p>Relatedly, many critics hold a belief that <strong>every</strong> work is political, regardless of what the author intended; for instance, critics may feel that an author has particular moral or social obligations to challenge the "status quo" (or whatever the critic <em>believes</em> is the status quo). A related school of thought holds that, since the author is someone with opinions who exists in a political context, those opinions and context must necessarily shape their work in various ways with varying degrees of subtly and self-awareness. An attempt to be apolitical is a kind of political statement unto itself (specifically, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralityBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralityBacklash">supporting the status quo</a>) and thats if one is lucky. If one is unlucky, this belief will be used to claim that apolitical works are, by definition, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">True Art</a>. We used to have a trope for this (True Art Sticks It to the Man) but it was sent to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PermanentRedLinkClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PermanentRedLinkClub">Permanent Red Link Club</a> because it necessarily broke the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">Rule of Cautious Editing Judgment</a>.

<ul><li> Shortly after its release, many began suspecting that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>'s Britannian Empire and its resource-grubbing expansionism was meant to be a thinly veiled potshot at America and the War on Terror, to the point where some began calling for a boycott of the show's eventual US release. In an interview near the end of the first season, director/co-creator Goro Taniguchi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">stated</a> that this is not the case, insisting that the whole reason he made the show was to tell an entertaining story and not to make any kind of political message. That the main character was Britannian probably helped reduce any backlash.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a> to the United States of America in the 2nd season... or more specifically, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">American Empire</a></em>, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica">the three divided American countries</a> who places a high priority on military industrialism and right-wing conservatism. The anime doesn't clearly state that the United States of America is a different country from the American Empire, which may lead viewers into thinking that the United States in general is the villain. The truth is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune">Shirow Masamune</a> divided the United States into 3 different countries (The United States of America, The Ameri-Soviet Union, and Imperial Americana) as part of the continuity that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> both take place in back when he wrote both series in the mid-'80s and early '90s. There were no intentional implications, but it still makes the whole thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> when compared to some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a>'s foreign policies during his administration.
<ul><li> The villains in the two series are, respectively, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a corrupt politician trying to make a profit in the healthcare industry and a right wing agent trying to instigate a war for personal gain</span>, while the two main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>-turned-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>es are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an anarchist hacker and a socialist revolutionary</span>. It's not particularly hard to see the show's political slant.
</li><li> The American Empire in the series has a defense treaty with Japan which means Japan "technically" cannot have an army, just like present day America and Japan. In the series, the American Empire is also portrayed as an openly imperialist power, invading countries like Mexico. Since many leftists (e.g. Che Guevara, Malcolm X) regards America as an evil imperialist empire and considering how the series give the socialist revolutionary and anarchist hacker quite the sympathetic portrayal...
</li></ul></li><li> Upon its release in the U.S., the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheSecretWorldOfArrietty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheSecretWorldOfArrietty">The Secret World of Arrietty</a></em> was accused as a pro-"Occupy Wall Street" propaganda film out to demonize the 1% and push environmental agendas along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLorax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLorax">The Lorax</a></em>.
</li><li> Comparisons between the Ishvalans from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> and the War on Terror are a dime a dozen. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that they're based on the Ainu people of Japan, not Muslims. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a> rolls with the similarities.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar">Mark Millar</a> continues to insist that any political allegory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, a plot in which superheroes who didn't want to register with the government were rounded up and shipped off to what's come to be called "Space Guantanamo" by both fans and the <em>Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics</em>, was completely accidental.
</li><li> It's been suggested that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> intended the two mutant leaders to represent the competing tactics of civil rights leaders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> (Professor Xavier) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>), and the analogy is very frequently mentioned in discussions of the books. Another comparison has been gays, or other specific or non-specific minorities, that some fans see it as a "violation" of what the story is supposedly about when a particular plot or character's behaviour does not fit in with their interpretation of choice. Some writers consciously or subconsciously fed this by modeling the mutants' plight in particular storylines on that of real-life minorities, which also led to fans squabbling amongst themselves as to whether the X-Men are more a metaphor for race or for homosexuality, and also to the tendency among some fans to consider "ugly" mutants "truer" mutants than "pretty" mutants. All this often loses sight of the fact that Marvel's mutants started out as a fairly standard science-fiction "super-race" melded with the standard Silver Age superhero conventions. Thus during the first two decades of the X-Men's existence the default was to maintain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> and hide that one was a mutant from the public, which would have caused a different sort of backlash if the feature had been intended as a metaphor of or a comment on the situation of a minority within society in the real world. More broadly, they represent alternative paths that oppressed people can follow: appeal to the consciences of the oppressors by taking the moral high ground, or defend your rights by force.

<div class="indent"> Make no mistake — these are some of the most beloved characters in comic book history, and it's specifically because of who they are. The X-Men are hated by the world purely because they were born different — it's not hard to see why that resonated with fans. Who knows how things would have turned out if Lee had spent a whole weekend inventing various radioactive animals to bite each of these people.
</div></li><li> In any case, the mutant metaphor was not apparent in the early Lee/Kirby issues.

Others have pointed out that there are countless white, straight comics fans who have personally identified with the <em>X-Men</em> characters, and that the comic's themes arguably speak more to <em>individual</em> alienation from society rather than group persecution. This is especially apparent since the most popular X-Man is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> whose stories rarely revolve around mutant prejudice and he's often presented in various media as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution">Not in This for Your Revolution</a> type, and often affected this pose in the earlier comics.

But this seems pretty superfluous when one realizes that the original Belgian name for "The Smurfs" (<em>Les Schtroumpfs</em>) combines both Latin and Germanic linguistic elements.

There was also a Google bombing mixing Sarkozy and Iznogoud. Moreover, an <em>Iznogoud</em> book written after Tabary's death in 2011 made extensive use of the similarity, and Sarkozy also won the 1999 Iznogoud Award, which is presented to the person who made the year's most high-profile failure.

It doesn't exactly help that the character is, at that point, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">referred to as "Ra's al Ghul" (meaning "head of the demon" in Arabic-and the original character is vaguely Middle Eastern) and talking about a city that is presumably located in the Western world.

<div class="indent">"<em>Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople, or Rome before it, the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.</em>"
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> got this in the week prior to its opening, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RushLimbaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RushLimbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> claimed that the name of the villain, Bane, is a thinly veiled jab at Presidential nominee Mitt Romney's former company Bain Capital, which had been in the news for the past few weeks. This is a pretty obvious fact-check failure, as Bane has been around as a character for at least two decades. Bain Capital had only been in the news for a few weeks, and Bane was revealed to be the villain of the movie almost two years prior, when Mitt Romney himself wasn't even a likely presidential candidate. Furthermore, Chuck Dixon and Graham Nolan, Bane's creators back in the 1990s, are both Republicans (which is pretty obvious from the subtext of many of the formers stories). Dixon wrote an op-Ed on a conservative website on their behalf where he announced that they hadn't intended Bane to be any sort of political commentary; their only goal in creating Bane was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">sell comic books and make money</a>. He also wrote about how its one of the few adaptations of the character that the both of them like.
</li><li> The plot points about Bane pitting Gotham's lower classes against the well-off and those in power has been interpreted as being in reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement, though whether the film is meant to be either for or against OWS or free-market capitalism differs wildly depending on who you ask.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em> (1992) was another <em>Batman</em> film that ran afoul of controversy, though it was presented to the public as just an escapist fantasy.
<ul><li> The plot features a recall election in Gotham City as a major plot point and released close to election season in America, so many critics and pundits couldn't help seeing the movie as a commentary on all that. Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> admitted in an interview that the Penguin was supposed to be an amalgamation of all the current political candidates.
</li><li> It also began shooting just a few months after the Persian Gulf War ended, making a climactic plot to destroy the city with remote-controlled missiles and the line "The liberation of Gotham has begun!" (a play on a Pentagon official's remark that "The liberation of Kuwait has begun" as Operation Desert Storm was launched) sound quite suspicious indeed.
</li><li> Then there is the Penguin's declaration of "Burn, baby - burn!" which was a quote popularly attributed to rioting blacks in 1965 Los Angeles. The film premiered a month after the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.
</li><li> Accusations surfaced that the Penguin's hooked nose was meant to make him look Jewish, purportedly turning him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew">Jewish caricature</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Anthony Lane at the New Yorker has a strange talent for looking at action movies and seeing endorsements for fascism.

Interestingly, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">wasn't really a negative review</a>; Kael just throws around the word "fascism" a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">lot</a></em>.
</li><li> Though considered a classic today, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> also earned the fascist epithet from Kael and other contemporary critics. Though director Don Siegel (a liberal) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> (a conservative) both denied any intended political message, it's often read as an endorsement of police brutality despite showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Harry being nearly as violent and unhinged as Scorpio</a>.
</li><li> Some critics have claimed that Showa <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> movies are Japanese nationalist propaganda revolving around WWII, though Ishiro Honda's pet themes were <em>anti</em>-nationalism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">unification of enemies against greater threats</a>. Other critics have claimed that the nuclear explosion that created Godzilla was a metaphor for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the monster representing America. Godzilla was changed into a good guy in later films after relations between the two nations had markedly improved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>The Examiner</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/over-sized-godzilla-a-symbol-of-american-consumer-greed">wrote a piece<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> speculating that the reason Godzilla seems fatter in this movie is for him to be a critique of the excesses of American greed and consumerism.
</li><li> William Tsutsui, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141472/william-m-tsutsui/for-godzilla-and-country">author of ''Godzilla on My Mind'',<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggests this film as being the turning of Godzilla into an American icon with the cheering he gets along with the MUTO love scene and violence being more overt than the Japanese films.
</li></ul></li><li> An In-Universe example happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker">Joker</a></em>. While Arthur did kill three employees of Wayne Industries, it was partially out of self defense and had nothing to do with a classist belief. This doesn't stop the citizens of Gotham from using it as a political point against the rich.
</li><li> Clips from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em> posted on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> tend to invite comments declaring that President Skroob is obviously Bush. They don't let the fact that the film was released thirteen years before Bush (and one year before his old man) was elected get in the way. Anyway, it's obvious based on his appearance that Skroob is based at least in part on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> (and, of course, on Emperor Palpatine, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, which <em>Spaceballs</em> spoofs).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</a></em> had shades of this, with the suspending of liberties and trials for suspected pirates by a corrupt government intent on wiping out a bunch of terrorizing marauders. Never mind that the suspension of civil liberties, especially in colonies and <em>particularly</em> for pirates, was a historical occurrence far predating any modern political situation. The screenwriters claimed to have taken the proclamation read in the film's opening from a real British colonial document circa 1800, but admitted that it was hard for viewers not to draw contemporary parallels.
</li><li> Some have interpreted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds">Inglourious Basterds</a></em> as an anti-American attack on torture and interrogation methods. Others consider it to be promoting war crimes. The film is morally ambiguous enough that it's hard to agree whether the Basterds were supposed to be heroes or not.

<ul><li> Around the time of its release, there was an online petition parodying this phenomenon by arguing against it on the basis that it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">insensitive name in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy</a> (whereas the title was thought up in the 1940s, before the World Trade Center even existed). Astoundingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">it drummed up some serious support from people who didn't check their facts</a>.
</li><li> Some critics claimed it was a pro-Iraq War/Bush-supported propaganda piece. This is a little odd since the original source was written by a British author several decades ago and the movie was directed, written, and co-financed by a New Zealander. Oh, and the films were shot back-to-back and were going into production by the time Bush came into office.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons reviewer Armond White is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">controversial figure</a> (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow">being a contrarian</a>) is because he always does a sociopolitical analysis of a film while doing his review.
</li><li> Andrew O'Hehir's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/andrew_ohehir/2010/10/06/secretariat">review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em>Secretariat</em> was based around the premise that a feel-good Disney movie about a legendary racehorse was actually a "Tea Party-flavored, Christian-friendly yarn" which he even likened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda films</a>. After massive backlash led by the unquestionably liberal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>, O'Hehir backtracked and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyRetcon">claimed that the review was tongue-in-cheek</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">deliberately over-the-top</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monsters2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monsters2010">Monsters</a></em> has a bunch of aliens from Mexico trying to get into America and succeeding despite a gigantic wall and security to keep them out. These aliens are stereotyped as villains in propaganda. These aliens are apparently not metaphors for Mexican immigration to the U.S according to director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarethEdwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarethEdwards">Gareth Edwards</a>, but that hasn't stopped people from drawing the comparison. The fact that Mexican immigrants making the border crossing are characters within the story and there really is a wall being built on the Mexican-American border does not help.
</li><li> Magda Goebbels stalked out of the premiere of <em>Die Reise nach Tilsit</em>. It was about a foreign woman seducing the husband of a virtuous German wife under her eyes — while Joseph Goebbels carried on with the Czech actress Lida Baarova (the German wife won in the end, in both cases; Hitler sent the actress back to her native country and told Goebbels there would be no divorce).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleLosAngeles">Battle: Los Angeles</a></em> has a scene that could be seen as commentary on "enhanced interrogation" techniques in the war on terror: The soldiers have captured a wounded alien soldier, and they cut it apart (while still living), trying to find the vital organs so they can know where to aim to kill aliens. There is no dialogue condemning or justifying this act (although the information they find does put them on even footing in the battle).
</li><li> Some even call <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> political. Many people on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">more conservative news shows</a> were upset that the movie's villain was a CEO who wanted to drill for oil, saying that the Muppets were <em>promoting class warfare for children.</em> They didn't do their research, since it later becomes clear that Tex Richman is evil not because he is a CEO, rich, or wants oil, but <em>because he is unable to laugh</em> and laughter, aka the third greatest gift ever, is necessary for happiness. In a possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a>, Disney made the villain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsMostWanted">the next Muppet movie</a> a Russian war criminal, which Fox News could conceivably interpret as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against communism (even though Constantine Frog is not a communist).
</li><li> The Chinese historical/fantasy movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hero">Hero</a></em> was regarded as highly controversial particularly in America because of the conclusion of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character accepting that a brutal dictatorship is the only thing that can stop the centuries of civil war and allowing the evil emperor to live is better for everyone than allowing the wars to continue forever</span>, which was widely interpreted as Chinese political propaganda against human rights activists and the democratic movement. Mostly likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> is still a very highly regarded trope in America, while the movie's message of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">Know When to Fold 'Em</a> finds much more acceptance in Europe.
<ul><li> Extremely controversial in Taiwan.The First Emperor has been a bad guy in Chinese culture for 2000 years; his position of support for a strong united China was seen as an attack on Taiwanese independence.

<ul><li> Ever since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes1968">Planet of the Apes (1968)</a></em> hit theaters in 1968, people of all political tendencies have interpreted the franchise as a metaphor for black people rising and taking over white people (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">and let's leave it at that</a>). The movies' antinuclear, pacifist message is far more evident.
</li><li> It's probably more deliberate in the sequels. For one, director J. Lee Thompson admitting to modeling the ape rebellion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConquestOfThePlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConquestOfThePlanetOfTheApes">Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</a></em> after footage of the Watts Riot. A black character makes this explicit when begging the apes, as a descendant of slaves, to be merciful with humans.
</li></ul></li><li> Critics and viewers interpret <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Patton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Patton">Patton</a></em> as everything from a straightforward, patriotic war movie to a satiric condemnation of militarism. Critics regularly made comparisons to the then-ongoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>, analogies reinforced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s alleged obsession with the movie. Since the filmmakers wanted a warts-and-all biopic of George Patton, whose historical reputation remains controversial, some of this was likely by design.

Which actually makes sense, considering that Stan Lee has talked about how he enjoyed the idea of creating a character like Tony Stark in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, saying that he wanted to create "the quintessential capitalist," explore Cold War themes, and that "I think I gave myself a dare. It was the height of the Cold War. The readers, the young readers, if there was one thing they hated, it was war, it was the military.... So I got a hero who represented that to the hundredth degree. He was a weapons manufacturer, he was providing weapons for the Army, he was rich, he was an industrialist.... I thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of our readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him.... And he became very popular."

However, since the Predator is an alien from outer space, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">the argument can easily be flipped</a>: a foreign invader, believing itself superior, comes to our planet and persecutes Earthlings, only to be slain by one of those "inferior" humans who relies on his innate cleverness.

Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> has often been in various and conflicting way by different people, often seeing it as a direct allegory of something. Tolkien himself denied it was an allegory of anything, but that due to its archetypal quality it had lots of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Applicability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Applicability">applicability</a>".
<ul><li> Some have interpreted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> as an allegory for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, despite Tolkien's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">explicit denial</a> that he was into allegory, stated dislike of the concept, irritation at speculation over the one Ring's "symbolism" and the fact the storyline was conceived, in part, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.
</li><li> There were also accusations of the reverse. The Shire was likened to idealized Germany, and the rampant racism-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">every good race is pretty</a>, tall and blonde, as "Aryan" aesthics... Notwithstanding that most of the characters are not blonde or tall, Tolkien hated how the Nazis use of Germanic and Norse legends put them in bad light, and it is on record that he berated a German editor who asked him if he was "Aryan" (see Quotes page).

As usual, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">Wikipedia goes into a lot of detail<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. When asked, Baum said that his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books were intended for children. The trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianOz">Dystopian Oz</a> tales inspiration from these theories.
</li><li> Richard Adams has always claimed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em> is simply a children's book. However, many fans disagree with him and see the book as a rabbit version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">Animal Farm</a></em> with the allegory taking aim at fascism and appeasement. Others see it as an attempt to fashion an English version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid">The Aeneid</a>.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWickedYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWickedYears">The Wicked Years</a></em> (the book series, not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">musical adaptation</a>) has been seen by critics as a metaphor not only for Nazism/Fascism but also for Nixonian politics. Then again, it may have been intentional...

<ul><li> Many people see Dumbledore and Fudge as allegories for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NevilleChamberlain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NevilleChamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> respectively. It helps that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that the parallels between the Death Eaters and the Nazis <em>were</em> intentional.
</li><li> Some have claimed that Umbridge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. The similarity boils down to "both are right-wing female politicians I don't like". Some have also compared Umbridge to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> (who was largely unknown even to most <em>Americans</em> at the time the book was written) based on the same logic. Apparently being female (and conservative) is the all-important qualifier for declaring that a disliked politician "is" Umbridge (there are no comparisons to Angela Merkel yet, though).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> gets a bit of this from time to time. For example: The claims that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em> are directly about the Iraq war (even though <em>Jingo</em> was written years before it), while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> has been described as a critique of Christianity by some people and a <em>defense</em> thereof by others.
</li><li> The children's book <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RainbowFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RainbowFish">Rainbow Fish</a></em> is about sharing, but many pundits accused it of being socialist propaganda written to turn children against traditional American values.
</li><li> Apparently the author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantressFromTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantressFromTheStars">Enchantress from the Stars</a></em>, Sylvia Louise Engdahl, got enough questions about this that she answered in on her website's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sylviaengdahl.com/elana.htm">FAQ<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Many people were under the impression that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a>'s relationship with the Younglings (a primitive planet with medieval technology) was an allegory for how 19th century European scientists viewed other races as primitive animals.
</li><li> Vladimir Nabokov insisted that his dystopian novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BendSinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BendSinister">Bend Sinister</a></em> was not meant to satirize the Soviet Union (or any other totalitarian regime), even though it features a country called Padukgrad and a dictator called Paduk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePowerOfFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePowerOfFive">The Power of Five</a></em>: The Old Ones vote Republican. No, really.
<ul><li> To elaborate, in the third book, "Nightrise", The villainous Old Ones are supported by a sinister corporation called Nightrise. During an election they work to sabotage the candidate John Trelawney, and even set up an assassination plot. Although no parties are actually named, Trelawney's opposition to Nightrise's corruption and his anxiety over guns make it likely that he is a Democrat, making Nightrise's preferred candidate Charlie Baker a Republican. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nightrise rig the election so Baker wins.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romance</a> was written by French authors about Charlemagne and his knights. However, even in France, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> and his knights took over as a favored theme. Many nobles and kings were related to one or the other figure in the Matter of France, and others claimed to be (even the fictitious ones). Arthur was safer. (Political use of him did occur, but was obviously derived from the romances, making their political implications less.)
</li><li> An in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/It" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/It">It</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>: when Bill Denbrough is in college in the early 1970s, he takes a writing class with a left-leaning professor who only likes stories that make a political point. For this reason, he dislikes most of Bill's apolitical sci-fi and horror stories. The only story he gives a good grade to is one about an alien conflict that he interprets as having an anti-war message.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WingsOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WingsOfFire">Wings of Fire</a></em> is a fantasy series written for children. But the second arc is about Dragon Hitler convincing his impoverished brethren to wage war on a tundra-dwelling species comprised primarily of soldiers with aristocratic heritage, so one may be reminded of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Nazi Germany fighting the USSR</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> has been decried as leftist propaganda specifically made to decry the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">Bush administration</a>.

</li><li> JMS has written several episodes where he purposefully did not take a stand in the issue presented, but rather presented both sides and let the viewers draw their own conclusions. This hasn't stopped many people from claiming that such episodes are clearly (for/against) (their views/views opposing their own). One example of an inversion of this trope is the episode <em>Confessions and Lamentations</em>, which is about a fresh outbreak of an alien disease that was believed to be spread through immoral behavior. A lot of people claimed this episode was meant as an allegory for AIDS, missing the fact that it's a closer parallel to the Black Death (which is even discussed in the episode itself). JMS has gone on record as stating that the point of the episode was to say that politicizing a disease is never a good idea. He did, however, explicitly compare the Clark administration to George W. Bush in one of the DVD commentaries.

Privatization was just around the corner in 1977, and the Occupy movement was 35 years away.

</li><li> In the Eighties, script editor Eric Saward purposefully tried to avoid political subtext as much as possible for a variety of reasons (lack of desire to offend, lack of desire to make allegorical stories about the real world in favor of interacting with the series' own history as a work of fiction, and several other reasons). This caused some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> moments, like when the series bought back the highly political Silurians in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E1WarriorsOfTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E1WarriorsOfTheDeep">an apolitical action story where nothing indicates either side is anything more than just a nasty lizard creature</a>  and of course the politics ended up in there anyway.

Um... right.
</li><li> A book claimed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> was white supremacist propaganda.
<ul><li> This claim may be inspired by the fact that the <em>only</em> religion of old (and by extension its "gods", i.e. the aliens standing in as these gods, or who inspired it) that is portrayed as good is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>. These "gods" are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">Grey Aliens</a> called Asgard, who regularly help Earth (and the teams of the Stargate Command in particular, who earned their trust), while otherwise posing as benevolent gods to less advanced societies in the few times they show up on their planets. Basically any other religion that shows up is staffed by Goa'uld, who are always evil and incredibly selfish (there is one exception in Lord Yu, who never claimed to be a God, and who was the first Chinese Emperor).
</li><li> There is also an exception for the Abrahamic religions. Christianity gets directly mentioned exactly once in the series, and then in a (more or less) positive light. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> travel to a world where the people were culled from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges">Middle Ages</a> England. Daniel posits a theory (which turns out to be wrong) that the Goa'uld who controls this world may be posing as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> of the Abrahamic faiths. Teal'c dismisses this idea, stating that he's read <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> and finds it impossible to imagine that any Goa'uld could be as benevolent as the deity from that book. Meanwhile the other two, Islam and Judaism, are never adressed at all. There <em>is</em> however a Goa'uld who poses as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> and turned a planet/moon into hell just because he could.
</li><li> Others interpreted it as the final victory of science over religion, fought by heroic atheists and liberated ex-faithful against an amalgamation of the leaders of the world's faiths.
<ul><li> The series does make the point that gods aren't defined by their powers, but rather by their actions and benevolence. The Goa'uld and the Ori, who abuse their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">positions of privilege</a> over their subjects, are not fit to act as gods over the people they rule. This was probably intentional, but considering Daniel's statements about fire being bad (the Ori use fire as a good symbolism, even choosing to appear as it instead of the default ascended light form) coming from the Ancients, it doesn't seem to mean they were against Christianity.
</li><li> It's important to note that, while this is mostly in the background and not heavily discussed, the main characters themselves are shown as being on different wavelengths when it comes to religion. Jack O'Neill is snarkily irreverent and cynical towards religion in pretty much all its forms. Cam Mitchell tends to be positive about it, mostly through anecdotes about his very religious grandmother, but it's unclear whether or how much he himself believes the same things. Samantha Carter, in the face of her possible death, expressed the hope that after all of her work convincing enslaved people that they were following false gods, "somewhere one of those gods" was real. Her father, Jacob/Sel'mak, is openly a believer. The series supports religious tolerance (and the additional aesop that pretending to be a god in order to exploit people is bad), but it's hard to find a strong stance for or against religion per se. The series doesn't even condemn paganism, as it's never clear whether the Goa'uld created/inspired the ancient religions or simply decided to impersonate its deities (most clues given point at the former, though).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> drew heavily on current events. Earth is savagely attacked, apparently out of nowhere, and the NX-01 (bringing along a cohort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a>) heads into a treacherous region of space to find the culprits. Many fans were afraid this storyline would be untrue to <em>Trek</em>'s philosophy, but they needn't have worried: the aliens aren't all bad (though there are a few problems - like that the most humanoid ones get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">reptilian</a> Xindi stay evil (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">you wouldn't say no to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">the head reptile, either</a>) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">insectoids</a> <strike> stay evil</strike> get cold feet while in transit to Earth and are blown up by the reptilians for their troubles), Archer's new hard-edged attitude isn't always endorsed, and there's enough ambiguity all round to keep it from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Political</a> in either direction.
<ul><li> Prior to that, a couple of first-season episodes — "Fortunate Son" and especially "Detained" — examined elements of the war on terror. But contrary to a common assumption, the decision to name the first season's bad guys "Suliban" happened long before 9/11. They <em>were</em> named after the Taliban, but only because Rick Berman thought that name had the exotic sound he wanted; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">no one was expecting it to become a household name</a>.

It was also (more than once) accused of promoting communism, conformity, lack of critical thinking and a "the state takes care of everything" mentality (or a "everything should be free" mentality).
</li><li> A rather odd example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsMyBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsMyBush">That's My Bush!</a></em>. Despite being created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> and featuring the former President's administration and family as characters, it wasn't intended as political satire, but rather a parody of cookie cutter 80s sitcoms. (Parker and Stone admitted that, just in case things had gone the other way, they also had a pitch for a sitcom about Al Gore, and said they would have used more or less the same jokes no matter who'd actually won.)
</li><li> Some have criticized the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries">Ultra Series</a></em> for supposedly having nationalistic anti-foreign sentiments, seeing the Japanese defense teams defending against various alien threats as paralleling Japan pushing away foreigners and foreign influence. Many point to the second episode of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraman">Ultraman</a></em> as an example, where the Baltan aliens were fleeing refugees after they blew up their own planet.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4odyj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4odyj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4odyj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ignoring the fact that they were planning to enslave humanity and take the planet by force, <em>and</em> Science Patrol actually okayed the idea of the Baltans living on the planet so long as they abided Earth's laws (which the aliens refused).</span> This is ignoring the many times that aliens were shown sympathetically (even as tragic victims of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">allegorical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racism</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5boki');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5boki" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5boki');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">such as in episode 33 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReturnOfUltraman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReturnOfUltraman">Return of Ultraman</a></em>, episode 25 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanMax">Ultraman Max</a></em>, and many episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven">Ultraseven</a></em></span>) and the main heroes, the Ultramen, are well... aliens.

This isn't helped by the fact that the show's plot (the alien Visitors, who receive the devotion of the people, are secretly plotting to destroy the world) bears a lot of similarities to various right-wing fears about Obama — compare the Visitors' alien nature to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">"birther" conspiracy</a>. Doesn't really help when the aliens provide "Universal Healthcare", and call it spreading hope... The writers have denied this, and claimed that the show is more about post-9/11 America than the current President.

Martha Reeves denied any political meaning to the song, but it was popular enough at rallies that it became controversial anyway.
</li><li> "Helicopter" by Bloc Party (which features such lyrics as "Stop being so American" and "Just like his dad") is frequently misinterpreted as being about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W.

</li><li> Viking metal bands are sometimes accused of promoting fascism, Nazism or white supremacism, largely because they make use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar">the same Norse and Germanic imagery which the Nazi party drew on</a>. A majority of the bands are emphatic that this is not the case. It doesn't help that a few <em>are</em> promoting fascism, Nazism, etc.
</li><li> Manowar was accused of supporting Nazism because the song "Blood Of Kings" has the line "back to the glory of Germany," intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to their large German fanbase.

The song declares that politically, the band are to the left, one repeated line being roughly "my heart beats to the left". Just to troll, though, they made the song sound like a military march, and "Links 2-3-4" is an actual German marching cadence, so <em>the album containing the song</em> was referred to by a reviewer as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicToInvadePolandTo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicToInvadePolandTo">Music to Invade Poland To</a>."

</li><li> Russel Morris' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> "The Real Thing" was interpreted by many as a commentary on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> ("Is there a meaning here? Is there a meaning there?

This is plausible, especially when Morrison describes the soldier's wife learning of her husband's death on the TV news (Vietnam being the first major war to receive extensive televised news coverage), but the lyrics are worded in such a way that, the television reference notwithstanding, the song could be applied to any war between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and today. And the Doors tended to remain silent on political matters, anyway.
</li><li> In order to counter the misconception that rock music and conservatism are wholly incompatible, the magazine <em>National Review</em> offered <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/217737/rockin-right/john-j-miller">a list of "Greatest Conservative Rock Songs."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Problem is, close examination will reveal that only about 40 percent of the songs are truly conservative; the rest are either libertarian or are just "old-fashioned" in a way that really isn't political at all. (For example, one song is considered "conservative" because it contains a Latin prayer.) Plenty of songs were included because they were at least partially anti-communist (did you ever hear of a popular song that was <em>pro</em>-communist?), as if conservatives have ever had a monopoly on anti-communism (and anyway, one of these songs is only "anti-communist" because it depicts the color <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">red</a></em> negatively!).
</li><li> "Disarm" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a> has been interpreted as being about the abortion debate because of the out-of-context lyrics "what I choose is my choice", "the killer in me is the killer in you" and "cut that little child" (although if those lines <em>were</em> all meant to be about abortion, they'd be pretty self-contradictory). Lyricist Billy Corgan has said it's an autobiographical song about his relationship with his parents growing up.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>: The entire augmentation debate is just like the abortion debate. Clinics built for augmentations being protested and firebombed by detractors, supporters declaring that it is their body and they will do with it what they like, and people against it using religious statements to oppose it. In one protest, you can see signs that say, "I regret my augmentation" much like "I regret my abortion" signs. And much how in real life how people on the fence about abortion will say "I don't mind it in cases of rape, health issues, or incest," one can hear characters say "I don't mind it in the cases of amputees." The Humanity Front and Purity First has many real-world analogies, with a legitimate political group sharing goals and views with a terrorist organisation, such as Sinn Féin and the IRA or Animal Rights groups and the ALF. Conspiracy-wise, Sarif Industries is under fire for trying to end Neuropozyne dependency, and in Real Life, there are proposals to develop <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer">embryo transfer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the point that abortion would not be lethal to the fetus - these cannot get off the ground due to anti-technologists protesting stem cell research... and stem cell researchers would probably rather not have the supply of aborted fetuses for stem cells cut off. The anti-aug crowd want augs eliminated, and Versalife is making a killing on Neuropozyne.

Just a few examples:
<ul><li> Upon being discovered by the rest of the galaxy the Krogan were ruthlessly exploited by races far more technolgically developed than they were, and once they were no longer needed and became a problem, the development of their a civilization was neutered both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">physically</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">societally</a> to the point of being almost totally untenable. The historically minded will note the similarities to the European colonization of Africa and the post-decolonization issues that continue to be a problem today.
</li><li> The story of the Quarians losing their homeworld and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">much of their population</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">extremely violent cataclysm</a>, and than using these past hardships (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">that no Quarians alive at the time of the game were alive for</a>) to justify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingForAHomeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingForAHomeland">reclaiming their homeworld</a> from its new inhabitants parallels the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews">Israel, Zionism</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">the current issues those caused</a>.
<ul><li> Note that the Quarians may also represent organizations such as Hamas, depending on how sympathetic the player considers either group to be.
</li><li> The Quarians' decision to shut down the Geth (a series of robots they created) once they began to approach artificial intelligence plays very well into the abortion debate.

<ul><li> The reaction and charges of "propaganda" and the great number of errors in representation has brought a great deal of criticism as well. Jean-Clement Martin, the historian who has served as a consultant for the game, and a respected member of the Society of Robespierre Studies, while noting that the script had a "royalist" bias feels that the game should be enjoyed as "fantasy" and perhaps if it stokes interest, it could lead players to read history books.

<ul><li> Its detractors point to its frequent use of politically incorrect material as comedy, saying that this "proves" <em>South Park</em> is racist and so forth. And some of its supporters (young conservatives and libertarians, mostly) see how <em>South Park</em> ridicules the politically correct and "enlightened" and love to think of the show as being a (somewhat ironic) defense of "traditional" American values — neglecting to notice that the show's creators try to offend <em>everyone</em>, regardless of where their political/social/cultural sympathies lie. Whether or not they do a good job at this is likely where the problem lies. Of course, seeing <em>all</em> targets as <em>equally</em> worthy of ridicule is, in itself, a political stance.
</li><li> Co-creator Trey Parker is a Libertarian, and he and Matt Stone have expressed conservative views both in and out of the show, leading some commentators to coin the term "South Park conservatives".
