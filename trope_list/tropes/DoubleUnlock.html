</div></div><p>Some video games have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlockableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlockableContent">Unlockable Content</a> — be it new characters, new gear, new levels, new play modes, or whatever else. Most of the time, unlocking the content is all you have to do. But every once in a while you'll run across a game that requires you to not only perform some feat to unlock the new item; you then have to perform a second feat (or pay some sort of in-game currency) to actually <em>receive</em> the item. The first unlock just informs you that the item exists (and usually what you need to do to get it), or otherwise makes the second lock available to you.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The pure version of this trope has one condition to reveal the prize and another to unlock it. There are a few reasons for a developer to do this, the most common being that the existence of the prize in question would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler">spoil</a> something in the game. Once that part of the game is completed, the prize can be safely <em>revealed</em>, but that doesn't mean the player has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourFun">earned</a></em> it yet.
</p><p>There are other variations that have no reveal condition:
</p><ol><li> A visible prize with a normal unlock condition, upon being unlocked, suddenly reveals another, previously unmentioned, unlock condition. The Monty Python page quote is an example of this variation.
</li><li> A prize actually has only one unlock condition — but achieving that condition requires you to unlock something else, and doing <em>that</em> requires something <em>else</em>, etc. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> with unlockables.
</li><li> The prize is put on sale after fulfilling a condition. Now you have the privilege of spending your in-game money (or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices">actual money</a>) to unlock it.

<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> does this with multiplayer unlocks. After maxing out to level 50 you are given the option to "Pass into legend" which will give you a star on your profile but also revert you back to level 1 and all unlockables will be lost. However you will gain unlockables, mainly new skins and mounts that were previously unavailable. You can do this four more times, each time with regular unlockables being unlocked at earlier and earlier levels. There are some unlockables that require you to reach level 50 five times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">its sequel</a> have this for its multiplayer. You have to reach a certain level requirement to unlock a gun, or meet certain conditions to unlock a perk's Pro version. In both cases, you still need to spend COD Points (the former) or an unlock token (the latter) on the gun or perk to actually obtain it. This is somewhat balanced by actually making guns available earlier than they usually would be in earlier games, and whenever you buy any given weapon in the former, all of its attachments are immediately available for purchase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em>. The "Back to Karkand" and "Close Quarters" expansions each introduce 10 new unlockable weapons (eight split up for each of the four kits, two kit-independent). However, half of the weapons' relevant assignments are initially locked, and progress made towards unlocking any given one of them will only count once you've completed a specific earlier assignment (i.e. the assignment to unlock B2K's L85A2 requires you to unlock the FAMAS first).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a></em>:
<ul><li> The guitar lessons are unlocked by beating a guitar mini-game. However, each song requires a number of medals to actually play, and at the point the mode is unlocked, you probably won't have enough medals for even one song.
</li><li> Battle of the Bands is unlocked for finishing the game. It consists of two modes, both of which require an A rank on all the guitar lessons for that mode, which, as mentioned, takes medals... a lot of them.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Team Racing</a></em> requires all 18 relics, which merely requires a solid time trial time in all 18 races. In an extended example of variant #2, one of the races is only unlocked by getting all 5 gems. Gems can be earned in cup races, which themselves are locked until you get 4 CTR tokens for <em>each</em>. Four of the five CTR token colors require the player to collect 3 letters placed around the track and winning the race, the purple tokens need you to collect crystals from a course within the allotted time. Also, you need two out of four keys to even access the room with the portals to the cup races and the first race cannot be unlocked until after you have three keys. All for that last eighteenth relic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</a></em> has inverted the locks. The only condition to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> is to claim all Gems. However, to get to 10 of them, you have to unlock levels by collecting relics. Of course, once you do, you have to actually claim those gems from the levels.
</li><li> The unlock systems in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a>'s games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> being the best-known) skirt with this.
<ul><li> The way it works is that when you complete a "challenge" in those games, the surrounding challenges are revealed, and certain challenges unlock prizes when completed. Though revealing the challenge isn't a prerequisite to unlocking it; it'll open if you fulfil the challenge even without knowing what it is. The grid also doesn't reveal what the prizes are, and it'll also hide challenge descriptions if the related game mode or whatever is still locked. Sega used the same method for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndSonicAtTheOlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndSonicAtTheOlympicGames">Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games</a></em>.
</li><li> Unlocking new characters in all <em>Smash</em> games except the Subspace Emissary in <em>Brawl</em> and World of Light in <em>Ultimate</em> first require you to fulfill character-specific unlock requirements, and then (naturally) defeat that character in a 1-on-1 match.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>, one type of challenge reward is a straight example of this trope: when you see "Weapon Unlocked: [Weapon Name]" it means that it's now <em>possible</em> to get said weapon via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">Random Drop</a>, but the unlock itself won't give you the weapon. The exception is the Zodiac Chambers, which give you both the weapon <em>and</em> the ability to make more.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Extreme 2</em> has a <strong>triple</strong> unlock: You have to unlock the fact that a bonus <em>exists</em>, then the right to buy it, and then actually purchase it. <em>Super NOVA</em> and <em>Super NOVA 2</em> have double unlocks at minimum: to attain certain songs, you have to complete other songs in "Master Mode" with challenges that range from pointlessly simple (such as "get a D-rank on this easy song") to insanely hard ("beat this really hard song with all the notes switched around, flowing in reverse, shaped like bumble bees, and accelerating as they approach the hit zone") — or you can just play the standard game for a long time to gain the unlocks instead. But that only unlocks the <em>appearance of the song in the shop</em>. You then have to <em>buy</em> the songs with in-game credits. And unfortunately, gaining credits is done by making a high rank on a song, which means the best way to gain credits is to replay songs you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessVictory">Full Combo</a> until you're utterly sick of them.
</li><li> In DDR A, in order to unlock an Extra Savior song from the New Generation folder, you must unlock and play the songs from either Beatmania IIDX, Jubeat or Sound Voltex before unlocking them in Extra Savior (Angelic Jelly is unlocked). Too bad, you can't unlock the songs in the North American version of the game despite you have the save data in those games mentioned.
</li><li> This unlock method is common in other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani">BEMANI</a> games, but one song was notable (read: infamous) for this: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> <em>Rock to Infinity</em>, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GitaDora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GitaDora">GuitarFreaks/DrumMania game of the same name</a>. To summarize as best as possible: you had to clear the previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">bonus bosses</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">each</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">one</a></em> of the past entries (GFDM V to V4, and one of the songs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04v26');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note04v26" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04v26');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>MODEL FT 2 Miracle Version, from V3</em></span> had only Extreme charts!) with 95% of all of the possible Perfects to gain a Medal, then you had to clear the regular Premium Encore Stage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gci9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1gci9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gci9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A.DOGMA</span>, with 96-98% of the possible Perfects, depending on which was played on Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania, respectively to gain its Medal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">And when you have all of the five medals</a>, you had to clear the Premium Encore Stage <em>again</em> as an Extra Stage (another 97-98% of Perfects required!), which would access Rock to Infinity <strong>only</strong> as the <em>Infinity Stage</em>. And only <strong>if</strong> you cleared the song (no easy feat) in Infinity Stage you would (finally) unlock the song for regular play.
</li></ul></li><li> Though Microsoft's <em>Beyond The Limit: Ultimate Climb</em> is set in the American Southwest, you can unlock a room that purportedly leads to an Arctic world. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">there is no way to unlock that world within the game and the would-be expansion pack was never released</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em>: NX2 and NX Absolute has this if the player uses a USB stick to save their profile. Through the game's mission mode, you unlock various remixes and extra charts. This merely makes them show up in the song select screen; once you actually try to play the songs, you find that you must pay milage (the game's equivalent of experience) to be able to play the charts.
</li><li> In <em>DJMAX Portable 2</em>, you can unlock different user interfaces, characters, and note skins...which you must purchase with gold earned from playing songs. Some of these items require you to pay many, many songs' worth of gold. <em>DJMAX Fever</em>, based off of <em>Portable 2</em>'s engine, alleviates this somewhat by making them much cheaper. Alternatively, if you're extremely patient, you can get the unlockables through playcount...except, you need at least 2,000 song plays to start getting the unlocks.
</li><li> In <em>DJMAX Trilogy</em>, this unlock system applies to <em>songs</em> as well. And not just that, in order to unlock them in Free Play mode, you must, after purchasing them, play them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameLevel">Stage</a> mode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a></em> has the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptArtGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptArtGallery">Concept Art Gallery</a>, bonus modes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Secret Characters</a> to purchase with points earned from playing the scenarios.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0">Resident Evil 0</a></em>, accessing the train engine is a triple unlock. First, you have to find a gold ring and a silver ring, the latter of which requires the Hookshot from the rear car of the train to reach. Then you use said rings to unlock the conductor's briefcase, which in turn contains the keycard needed to unlock the engine car.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em> all have unlockable special weapons/figures that first have to be unlocked through either progressing through the game or getting the secret collectibles that then have to be bought with an <em>inordinate</em> amount of money/skill points. In the case of RE6 the secret unlockable skills are master skills for each weapon class unlocked through killing a certain amount of enemies with it before having to be bought and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">infinite ammo for completing the campaign</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> uses <em>all three methods</em> for one upgrade. To get infinite ammo for most weapons you have to finish the campaign, shoot the required amount of BSAA emblems and fully upgrade one of the weapon (which will require you to first find the weapon, then purchase all the upgrades for it) in order to reveal the final step: Purchase the ability for infinite ammo from the main menu with skill points.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a> GX</em> also requires purchasing things in a shop after you have 'unlocked' them. Unlike other examples, currency is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">absurdly easy to come by</a>. Especially if you are fortunate enough to live near an arcade with <em>F-Zero AX</em>—take your memory card to the machine and play a few rounds. Guaranteed currency for finishing a race.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Dreamcast</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom">SNK vs. Capcom</a></em> had quite a few double unlocks. Most egregious: To unlock the secret characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Nakoruru</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers">Morrigan</a>, you had to first buy all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">extra colors</a> of the characters from the respective companies. This allowed you to buy Nakoruru's (for SNK) and Morrigan's (for Capcom) "shadows", which meant that you could fight them in the middle of a tournament if your scores were high enough. Only after defeating both of them in the aforementioned manner and after buying the EX versions of their respective companies' characters could you buy them and unlock them for play. Playing as the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter">Akuma</a>, required a repeat of the process — buying Morrigan and Nakoruru, unlocking Akuma's shadow, getting to Akuma and winning against him in the final fight, and finally buying him. For those without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoGeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoGeo">Neo-Geo Pocket</a> and a copy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomMatchOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomMatchOfTheMillennium">SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium</a></em>, these requirements were onerous and grinding indeed.
</li><li> The <em>WWE SmackDown</em> / <em>SmackDown vs. Raw</em> series has a bit of this. The run of games from 2006 to 2008 required achieving things to unlock (most) of the legends, after which they could be purchased in the game's shop. Most egregious, though, is the fourth game, <em>Shut Your Mouth</em> - in it, in order to play as Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, or X-Pac in the story mode you had to first get through about a year's worth of playtime until their role popped up, then win at certain shows and choose to unlock each of them when given a set of choices. The problem being <em>they were unlocked from the start for exhibition play anyway</em>.
</li><li> <em>Excitetruck</em> and <em>Excitebots</em> have a lot of this. The designs for some of the bots are a double unlock hidden behind a triple unlock. First, you need to 1) finish the regular difficulty to reveal the <em>shadows</em> of the bots, then 2) earn enough lifetime stars to reveal the bots in full, then 3) have enough stars on you to purchase the bot. Secondly, you need to 1) play 15 races with the unlocked bot to reveal the special design for it, and 2) get 25 S-grade finishes, which don't start counting until you reveal the design.

</li><li> <em>Soul Calibur III</em> does this with its weapons and certain gallery items, requiring you to beat someone using the weapon in Tales of Souls or completing the same mode as a character to make the respective items available in the shops. IV also inherited the part about unlockable character design pieces from here. III is kind enough to give you new characters and stages upfront when you beat them once, however.

</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife">Drawn to Life</a></em> loves this. When you get an item in a stage, it says you unlocked it, only for it to appear in the shop. And unlike many games, there's no really quick way to earn a lot of coins, meaning it's quite an annoying task. Also, one of the items that's found in stages is the animation bubble, which lets your character do a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> pose when purchased. Except you have to find THREE of them in different levels before one appears in the shop for about quadruple the price of most other items.

Pro tags have no actual purpose beyond selecting one to appear next to your name. Once you buy the custom classes (which, technically, you could buy one of and just re-customize each time you want to change classes, taking probably less than an hour to get), money has no purpose other than to buy pro tags.
</li><li> In the Facebook game <em>Crazy Planets</em>, some of the medals involved having all the robots in a level be frozen at once. However, the only weapon that freezes robots is the Ice Rocket, which is a weapon you must build. And to build it, you have to collect the necessary gems and metals. At least the other weapon-specific challenges involved the two you start the game with (Bazooka and Grenade).

The expansions create rooms that need to be decorated with certain pieces to attract tenants. To get the pieces you have to progress the plot to access the stages that contain the pieces you then need to find. Once the tenants arrive you play their minigame stages to get new fabric textures, but unlocking new minigame stages requires completing the previous minigame stages as well as being able to access the main game stages that the minigame stages take place in.

On the hexagon-shaped skill-screen, you have to purchase an available skill pack, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">master it</a> to unlock the skills around it. Then, you have to buy <em>those</em> and <em>master</em> them if you want to learn them, which in turn unlocks more skills to buy and master.
</li><li> In many games, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansPlayable">defeating certain bosses grants you the privileges to fuse them</a>. You still need to find the component demons.
</li><li> Many special fusions require demons / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Personas</a> that in turn need to be fused from some other combination of demons. This trope especially comes into play if a demon that requires a special fusion has component demons that require <em>other special fusions</em>. For example, Messiah in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, on the surface, only needs two Personas: Thanatos and Orpheus. Orpheus is your starter Persona, but Thanatos requires a 6-way special fusion, and one of the components for that fusion, Alice, requires a 4-way special fusion, and one of the components for <em>that</em> requires an item from one of Elizabeth's requests. As if that isn't enough, you need to max out the Death and Judgment Social Links to be able to fuse Thanatos and Messiah, though mercifully both Social Links automatically rank up and max out as you progress the plot.

To equip a new item or learn a new ability, you must buy the item/ability from the store with Gil, then purchase the relevant License on the character's personal License Grid with LP.

</li><li> Most of the advanced job classes also fall under this trope. To be able to use a different job, you need to master abilities from another job that is required. To get the more advanced jobs like Master Monk and Assassin, you have to complete missions related to these jobs so that you can unlock the said jobs, and then you start mastering abilities from other jobs as normal in order to gain access to the job. This was done to prevent players from entering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> territory by getting advanced jobs way too soon, something that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> had problems with.

To be able to become an Assassin, you have to master abilities from the Sniper and Elementalist jobs and those two jobs also require abilities from <em>other</em> classes. Some players prefer to wait until they can hire a Viera into the clan and hope the new recruit is an Assassin by default.

RMs are acquired by breaking level caps. The first comes automatically when breaking the cap once, but when doing it again a similar window appears informing them the next RM is available but the player must use the character in battle until it randomly drops. Then there are scenarios in which to unlock a character's Record Materia you must first get that character to level 65 and then either use the character in battle on the realm that character originates from or complete a very specific challenge. Most skip over the bit about having to get the drop and bombard the official site with complaints that they can't find the RM in the inventory.

<ul><li> Access to later levels requires the use of multiple spells granted by items which you build yourself. You must first find the hidden recipe, then collect the ingredients (some of which will need to be crafted themselves - or you could gather <em>other</em> collectibles to improve the rate at which they drop from foes), then finally use the synthesis machine in the middle of the castle. Then, assuming you can find the level, you must meet the aforementioned orb, gem and key requirements.

And also unlike previous installments, there's no Connection Map to chart all this out for you (and in previous installments, the Connection Map requirements were Boolean ORs instead of ANDs <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36kmq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note36kmq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36kmq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"you must recruit <em>any one</em> of these characters" instead of "you must recruit <em>all</em> of these characters"</span>).

First, you'd need to find a cassette with a list of challenges on it. Then you'd need to complete all of those challenges, causing graffiti souls to appear. Collecting all of the graffiti souls would unlock a series of time trials, and after finishing all of those with a high enough score you would <em>finally</em> unlock a new character. If you wanted all the characters, you would have to do this for every stage.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade">Infinity Blade</a></em> has a number of examples. You have to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">God-King</a> to unlock the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, but you still need to gather the necessary gold to buy it from the store, too. It's not THAT expensive, though. On the other hand, there's a full set of Infinity Plus One Gear that is unlocked by defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> and entering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> - it's the best gear in the game, but it's LUDICOUSLY expensive, and all beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> does is make it appear in your store to taunt you with its enormous price. And then there's the 'Black Edition' of that same gear, which is arguably even more powerful, though geared heavily towards a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> setup - to unlock that, you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">enter Negative Bloodline</a> mode, which automatically equips you with the gear but prevents you from changing any of it as long as you're in Negative Bloodline. Then reach Bloodline -10 to get an achievement, and return to the 'normal' bloodline by starting over from Bloodline 1. The uber-powerful Black Gear disappears from your inventory as soon as you return to normal play, but now you have the option of buying it from the store! For an even higher price than the ordinary Infinity Plus One Gear!
<ul><li> ...needless to say, the game allows you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">buy gold with real money</a>. One might argue that all that gear exists solely to tempt you into shelling out a few bucks for a big enough pile of gold to actually use them, since it'd take EPIC amounts of grinding to get otherwise.

The only exceptions to this are items that are starting equipment for a recently unlocked character (and with the exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the D6</span>, which becomes Isaac's starting equipment if unlocked, every character's starting equipment unlocks at the same time as the character) and an item which is required to enter the expansion pack's most final of final levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em> has a randomized tech tree, so you can miss certain techs. However, if you defeat ships using a tech or have a friend who has it, you can start a special project to get the tech. As you can probably tell by reading the rest of this page, a special project only gives you the ability to research the tech, not the tech itself. The sequel took this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by making all high-level techs require a "feasibility study," which would allow you to research the tech if successful. You can bypass this if you manage to salvage the tech; presumably, the reasoning is that you managed to pick up a working sample to reverse-engineer as opposed to starting from theory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelAvengersAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelAvengersAlliance">Marvel: Avengers Alliance</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has Premium Missions (one per chapter) which are unlocked by recruiting a certain hero. These missions are also the sixth and last of the chapter and are not playable until the player had played each of the previous five missions at least once.
</li><li> Recruiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl">Squirrel Girl</a> requires doing a series of ten tasks, one of which requires finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">fifteen of an item</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a> from enemies, one of which requires researching an item that takes eight hours to finish, and two of which require recruiting and training other expensive characters. Once all ten tasks are complete, you win... the ability to <em>buy</em> Squirrel Girl (and she's one of the game's most expensive characters). In addition to all of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">there's a time limit</a>, after which the tasks will disappear and you won't be able to get her at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> has the most insane double unlock there is thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">Teasing Creator</a> giving extremely vague hints. There is a secret hidden somewhere in the game and its clues can only be found in the DLC level Counterfeit. You have to do the following:
<ol><li> Have all players stand in very specific spots in the map to hear static and then decode the static to see its image.
</li><li> Use various props and other items strewn in the map to see how the clues can come together (some clues are just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>).
</li><li> Find out that the clues lead to another level, which is First World Bank.
</li><li> Play First World Bank with everyone using the golden masks, which in order to acquire, you have to have beaten all the original heists on the highest difficulty level (Overkill 145+).
</li><li> Stand in very specific spots in the bank to reveal a switch.
</li><li> Press the switch to reveal a hidden door and use the drill on it, to which you must wait 2 hours for the drill to finish.
</li><li> Enter the secret room and press some specific tiles on the floor. Pressing the wrong ones releases gas that kills you. Do it correctly and you open the vault revealing a stash of gold bars and some masks. You're not exactly done just yet! In order to qualify for the prize that Overkill teased, you had to send them a video recording of your team's successful attempt to open the vault. Oh, and players only got 30 days to attempt this challenge for the prize.
</li></ol></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> also uses this trope:
<ul><li> Unlocking weapons requires reaching a specific reputation level to gain access to them, then spending money to actually purchase them. This becomes averted once you go infamous, as weapons purchased remain in your possession, with only the restriction to reputation level remaining. Other items like different types of body armor and deployables also avert this, as while you may need to level up to unlock them or get the cash and skill points to do so, there's no second step to that.
</li><li> Several items can only be accessed by first unlocking the achievement that adds the items to your inventory and then buying the DLC that actually lets you use those items. The achievement tells you what those items are, but not which DLC you need.
</li><li> The game also does this in one of its DLCs, in that nearly half of the items from this DLC are only accessible if you have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a></em> in your library. Granted, this is a <em>triple unlock</em>, in that you need to buy both <em>PAYDAY 2</em> and <em>Hotline Miami</em> along with the DLC that unlocks these items.
</li><li> Remember that convoluted sequence of unlocks above from the original game? With the release of First World Bank for PAYDAY 2, this has now come to the sequel too. With all of the requirements. The game even adds another tier to the unlock; instead of Golden Masks, you need the Death Wish Masks for all of your crew. The Death Wish Masks, unlike the Golden Masks, requires you to have beaten <em>all levels in the game</em>, not just the original heists. Yes, this includes DLC heists. While in theory you can do it without ever buying a single DLC (via having someone else host a game that has the DLC), good luck trying to find someone with the patience to babysit your ass through all of it (unless they're in the same boat as you).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4frb6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4frb6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4frb6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">On the plus side, you don't need to beat all levels on the highest difficulty anymore.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame">Lego adaption game</a> series is built on this trope. You have to first find the item (extra characters or cheats or whatever) you want to unlock during the different stages or areas, then you have to pay for them with the Lego studs you've been collecting. You will almost always have many more things waiting to be bought than you have studs to pay for them. Thankfully, the developers made it possible to unlock the Studs X2 perk right at the beginning of every game either by entering a code or some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">clever abuse of custom or code-unlockable characters</a>.
</li><li> Everything available through the black market in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause</a> 2</em> - first you have to cause enough chaos to unlock something, and then you have to spend in-game money to have it delivered to you. This makes most DLC weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> at best, as, being DLC, nobody else uses them, and therefore if you run out of the tiny amount of ammo you're given for them (no upgrading these things, they're already at max level), you have to buy it again.
</li><li> Upgrades in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> not only require a metric ton of cash to purchase, but also require you to be at a certain Respect level to even have the option. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Managing to find and kill Professor Genki</a> can help with that, but only so much.

You can earn small but significant stat bonuses, called "virtues," by grinding through lots and lots of mobs in the game's various regions. The first deed lets you know which mobs you have to kill in a particular region; (orcs/goblins/trolls/etc) the second deed shows you what virtue you'll actually get and just how many mobs you have to kill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrimsonGemSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrimsonGemSaga">Crimson Gem Saga</a></em> requires you to unlock the ability to see what skill you want to get, then pay to get the skill using the same points you just used. To make matters worse, the points come in very small amounts from defeating enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: To craft some weapons or Warframes, you need a certain Mastery Level, which requires you to level up other weapons or Warframes first. And for some of those, you first need to craft components before you can craft the item proper.
</li><li> In most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> games, you start with only a few available character classes, and have to meet certain conditions to unlock new ones. Then, upon meeting the requirements for a given class, you must then pass a bill via the Dark Assembly before you can actually create any characters of that class. However, as of <em>Disgaea D2</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">the second step is no longer necessary</a>.

Most people would probably be confused as to what "Casino Run" is, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a> fans may know that the text actually means "hold both flippers during the 'Casino Run' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode">Wizard Mode</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JackBot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JackBot">Jack*Bot</a></em> to receive game hints".

Houndour can only be caught in <em>X</em>, and Electrike can only be caught in <em>Y</em>, but their respective Mega Stones can only be found in the version they're <em>not</em> native to. This also applies for the Aggronite, Tyranitarite, Aggron and Tyranitar. Larvitar and Aggronite are in <em>Y</em>, Aron and Tyranitarite in <em>X</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> has the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismantledMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismantledMacGuffin">Triforce</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a>, in which you first have to find the eight Triforce Charts scattered about the Great Sea and islands via the Incredible Chart obtained after rescuing Aryll, then have Tingle decipher them, THEN go to the spot in the sea that the chart specifies and fish up the shards, which are assembled to unlock the final dungeon. The Wii U version simplified this by replacing five of the triforce charts with the actual shards themselves, saving several steps.

In order to buy it, you need to fund Malo's shop to the tune of several thousand Rupees, at which point he buys out the shop, leaving the armor for sale. But it's still very expensive, and works on Rupees (so if no money remains after the purchase, it still won't be ready for use).

In order to open the fountains, you must first give rupees to the Great Fairies within them, which get progressively more expensive. The more fountains you open, the more the Great Fairies can upgrade your armor. On top of this, you'll need all kinds of materials in order to actually <em>pay</em> for the upgrades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em> goes a little overboard with this trope. As a reward for clearing certain Adventure Mode missions, you may earn a Sealed Weapon. This means that the weapon in question has been added into the weapon drop pool and you can now potentially obtain it: while you do get said weapon upon unlocking it, it has no stars which increase its strength or skills, meaning that any additional copies of the weapon you'll get will practically be guaranteed to be better than the initial weapon. Some weapons may have sealed skills, which require a multiple of 1,000 KOs before the skill can take effect and it can be transferred or removed. To unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Master Sword's</a> full potential, its seal needs to be broken.

The Casino Vault at the end is a triple unlock; first you have to download the three ambient music tracks in the Restaurant, Suites, and Casino, then combine the musics at the lobby terminal, then finally, have Christine say Vera's password at the elevator microphone, or if you killed her, play Vera's audition holotape.

Only then can you utilize that aspect in your next game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game often has faction rewards tied to one's reputation with the faction, and which must then be purchased with coins or certain tokens. This was the case for Valor Point gear in Mists of Pandaria, although it became easier to purchase over time.
</li><li> The double unlock system in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> (where gear was gated behind both reputation <em>and</em> valor point requirements) became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a>, since the only way to raise reputation was doing daily quests, forcing players to run lots and lots of daily quests just to unlock the ability to buy raid-level gear with a currency mostly awarded from dungeons and raids. It was phased out in patch 5.3 and didn't return in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>. It was originally a <em>triple</em> unlock, you had to get rep with the Golden Lotus to allow you to even <em>start</em> gaining rep with the one you wanted, <em>then</em> you had to spend the valor points.
</li><li> A minor case with flying mounts in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> and <em>Legion</em>. Initially, flying mounts were not going to be included at all in <em>Warlords</em>, but Blizzard backed off that position after intense player response. The capability to use flying mounts in Draenor was added in a patch...but unlike previous implementations of flight, it was not a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashGate">Cash Gate</a>. Instead, the player had to complete an achievement (that itself was composed of a series of <em>other</em> achievements) that proved the player had gone through a large portion of the expansion's content <em>without</em> using a flying mount (up to and including content from the latest patch); only <em>then</em> would they earn the ability to fly. Once it was achieved on one character, however, the capability was unlocked for all characters on the same account. <em>Legion</em> used the same system.
</li><li> Allied Races can only be accessed after buying the <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> expansions. Even then players must reach Exalted with the related reputation and complete an associated questing achievement to unlock each race. And for an added layer of unlocking, their custom racial armors can only be unlocked by creating a new character and leveling it to the max level.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game started this with Season 2 of its Living World content. Each new chapter is added to a player's account either by logging in while it is current content or by purchasing after the fact at the in-game story. To access the chapter itself, players must first complete any preceding chapters in the Season first.
</li><li> The <em>Heart of Thorns</em> expansion regions can only be accessed after completing several chapters from Season 2.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DLCQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DLCQuest">DLC Quest</a></em>, the "DLC," which, in this game, includes not only cosmetic upgrades, but also things you need to move onward, and even some <em>basic features</em>, must not only be bought with in-game currency, but often must be found (often by going up to something that you can't get past without it).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewLeaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewLeaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a></em> has public works projects. While a few are unlocked automatically when you gain the ability to build PWPs, most have to be unlocked separately, usually by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">waiting for a villager to suggest it</a>, although a few have different unlock conditions (for example, you unlock the Fortune-Teller's Shop by visiting Katrina 20 times). Then you have to talk with Isabelle to start construction and raise Bells to actually build the thing.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">DIY Recipes</a> work in much the same way. In order to craft an item, you first must find and read the recipe for that specific item. Then, you'll need to gather the necessary ingredients in order to actually craft it. Fortunately, DIY Recipes are much easier to come by in this game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniRobotWars">Mini Robot Wars</a></em>, in order to get upgrades for your Minirobots, you first need to beat the level that gets you the upgrade, then buy the upgrade with metal in the lab.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>: There are twelve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem">vocations</a>, each giving a total of 200 skill points at level 99. However, there are <em>twenty-six</em> 100-point skill categories, meaning that to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">all skills maxed out</a> you need to get a character to level 99 in a vocation and revocate it, dropping him back to level 1 so you can start grinding again. At least revocating has the effect of improving the random treasure map drops and can be done 10 times.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryptOfTheNecrodancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryptOfTheNecrodancer">Crypt Of The Necrodancer</a></em>, there are shops in the lobby, and most of the items being sold in them are bought to allow those very same items to appear in the dungeon. The shops themselves also have to be unlocked by finding and rescuing the shopkeepers in the dungeon. Fortunately, unlike most modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">Roguelikes</a>, when you unlock an item in this one, it's generally guaranteed to spawn the next time you play the game. Unfortunately, it's generally in a chest in a hidden room you might not spot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsCrown">Dragon's Crown</a></em>, you can eventually unlock the option of changing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">Narrator's</a> voice to that of any of the six playable classes. How do you do this? By clearing the game on Normal once with that character to reveal his/her voice pack in Lucain's shop, then paying <em>1 million</em> gold <em>each</em> to actually unlock them. Unless you're prepared to forego more important purchases like equipment appraisals and potions in an attempt to save up for them, the only time you'll get to hear these different voices is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">when you've already done nearly everything in the game...</a> or by purchasing the unlock key from the Playstation Store. To be fair, said unlock key was offered for free during the game's first few weeks of release, and its regular price from then on is pretty low.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfMordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfMordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a></em>: You gain Ranks by killing Captains, Power (your Rank exp) directly proportional to the Level of the Captain and whatever the hell he was doing at the time, which allow you to use your skill points to unlock better abilities. Also, some abilities have to be unlocked through main quests.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SensoryOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SensoryOverload">Sensory Overload</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingFloor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingFloor">thirteenth floor</a> has a triple unlock; finding the vent control switch to access an otherwise blocked vent, using said vent to access the temperature control so you don't get burned in the heat ducts, and finding the black passcard for the door at the end of the level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectWorld">Perfect World</a></em> has rank equipment. Completing certain quests (as well as handing in certain items) earns your character Reputation, and reaching certain milestones earns you the right to get advanced equipment. Each "rank" comes with a ring, for which you need to trade in your previous rank ring. At certain ranks you also have the ability to purchase other equipment from an NPC for in-game coin. Originally, ranks went up to 8 with Rank 8 providing access to a full set of gear. Unlocking that required 200 thousand reputation (obtainable per 1, 2 or 3 points from special repeatable quests as well as in larger amounts from certain items and unique quests), which took a lot of effort to acquire. Then there was still the price tag of around 1 million of in-game currency per piece. The ranks before that were relatively tame in both reputation requirements as well as item price. After a few updates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Rank 9</a> was introduced. Getting that required <em>another</em> 100 thousand reputation, and, on top of that, in-game coins wouldn't do anymore. Each piece requires several medals which at the time of the introduction were given to the master of a random guild that held land on the Territory Wars map (Guild versus Guild mass-PvP event). In other words, extremely rare item. "Luckily", the medals were later made available in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Gold Shop</a>, at a price of 25 gold for one or 100 for a pack of five. The price of gold is $1 per gold or (currently) around 3-4 million in-game currency. These also occasionally go on sale. There is another item that's required along the medals that can be obtained in multiple ways, but the player market price tends to be around 10-20 million a piece. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">And then there are recasts (upgrades)...</a>. Needless to say, the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRR9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRR9">RRR 9</a> (fully upgraded rank 9) equipment is the most powerful in the game, surpassed by nothing.
</li><li> The Famicom port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a></em> has a clusterfuck of unlocks to enter the Abandoned Mine. First you need to use the teleportation statues in the overworld to find Frea the water guardian, then fetch the Staff of Sarana so she can power it up, then use it to move a tree out of the way. Then there's one more kicker; the inital mine entrance is a fake; to enter the real mine, you need to solve a puzzle back in Minea according to the instructions in the fake mine. Other versions of the game also have their share of double and multiple unlocks, for example, to reach the last part of the Shrine, you need the Mask of Eyes, which is in a locked chest opened with the Treasure Box Key, which, at least in some versions, you have to obtain from Feena, whose cell is unlocked with the Prison Key. Then after that, you have to find two more keys to unlock the boss room.
</li><li> Variant 2 is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></em>. To bust Craig out of detention, you need the gold key. The gold key is in a locked room that requires a silver key. No points for guessing that the room with the silver key is locked, necessitating a brass key which can be obtained in the hallway. Throughout this, Mr. Mackey comments on how this elaborate system will prevent Craig from getting freed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookieClicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookieClicker">Cookie Clicker</a></em> has special upgrades available in the Christmas season, unlocked by increasing Santa Claus' level. Each Santa upgrade costs cookies, which then unlocks one of the Christmas upgrades, which you then need to pay more cookies to buy.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyGameloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyGameloft">My Little Pony</a></em> mobile game, unlocking a pony from completing the minigames (usually the mine cart minigame) means that pony can now be purchased from the store.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock">BioShock</a></em>'s first proper mission, Dr. Steinman holds the key to Neptune's Bounty, but to clear the barrier blocking the entrance to his lab, you need the Telekinesis Plasmid, which is behind an ice wall that must be melted with the Incinerate! Plasmid.
</li><li> If you want equipment and runes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueLegacy">Rogue Legacy</a></em>, you first need to find the blueprint or rune in the castle. Then, on the next life, you have to buy it. The equipment can fall into a <em>Triple</em> Unlock, as you might need to upgrade your weight load score in order to be able to wield it.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidAndAlsIncredibleToons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidAndAlsIncredibleToons">Sid And Als Incredible Toons</a></em> has an unusually literal example. Five of the "Really, Really Hard" puzzles and five of the "Looney Bin" puzzles are doubly padlocked. You can only access these after you beat all 90 other puzzles in the game, 15 of which have to be unlocked first, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnterSolutionHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnterSolutionHere">Enter Solution Here</a>.

However, each pilot must first be unlocked by completing specific missions (sometimes with optional objectives) and most missions are only unlocked by playing other missions. The most convoluted unlock requirements involve obtaining a pilot by clearing a mission with a specific mobile suit when that suit's canon pilot cannot be selected due to story reasons. So that means you need to unlock one suit to do a mission to obtain a pilot to unlock the suit you're after.
</li><li> Unlocking songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AikatsuPhotoOnStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AikatsuPhotoOnStage">Aikatsu! Photo on Stage!!</a></em> beyond easy difficulty in live shows requires one to unlock the song in easy difficulty first by clearing the relevant story episodes. Then, score rank of A or above for said difficulty is needed to access the medium difficulty, which needs to be repeated on medium difficulty to unlock hard difficulty. Some songs even become triple lock because some of the story episodes require the character to be unlocked first. However, if the player gets score rank of A while in story mode live stages, the next difficulty level is unlocked straight away.
</li><li> In order to access the alternate costumes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, you first need to unlock the ability to buy them through story mode scenarios. These will then be available for purchase from the store.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">trophy system</a> works this way. To acquire a trophy, first you have to earn it. The method to earn a trophy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">almost never explained anywhere in-game</a>, to give the playerbase something to search for. Then, once you've figured out the obscure conditions (or more likely, someone else has and you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule">looked them up on the wiki</a>) and fulfilled them, you have to buy it from the Trophy Hut for 10,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency">Meat</a>. Oh, but don't think that just because you've met the conditions once means you can buy the trophy whenever you like; some trophy unlocks expire at the end of the day, or the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">ascension</a>, or even the moment you stop fulfilling the conditions. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> joke parodied this with a trophy that was earned by having less than 10,000 Meat on-hand, making it impossible to buy.
</li><li> To acquire a Skillcape in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, one must have level 99 at the corresponding skill, as well as 99k coins to purchase it.
<ul><li> Many, many quests have a large list of prerequisites to begin them. These often include several other quests that may have their own exhaustive list of prerequisites (which can include even further quests).

However, some of these rewards (the most useful ones, naturally) don't unlock until after you beat the game, even if you have the orbs. These rewards aren't marked in any way either, so if you make a point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">collecting every orb you can</a> on your first playthough, you'll eventually stop getting new stuff and won't know why.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blinx">Blinx</a></em> games unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">ultimate Sweeper</a> in the shop after you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">collect all of the Cat Medals</a>. You still have to buy them, and they're both very expensive — in the first game, the TS-X7 Supreme costs 90000G, three times as much as the second priciest item.

If you immediately select it, however, you'll see that all of the options are grayed out. That's because you have to play the game again, and any scenes you witness even in passing will be unlocked in the Theater, including any that lead to game overs in normal play.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Celeste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Celeste">Celeste</a></em> has Chapter 8 (The Core) revealed on the map screen after you beat the game.

To unlock the B-Side of Chapter 8 after finding the usual cassette tape within the level, you have to had collected every heart in the game up until that point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At which point, the C-Sides are revealed and access to Chapter 8's requires getting every other C-Side heart.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CytusII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CytusII">Cytus II</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a> characters need to be levelled up just like the base characters in order to unlock all their songs after you purchase them. One of ConneR's songs is also unlocked through an event connected to Xenon's story, which means you need to buy both of their chapters to unlock this song.

Firstly, you need to complete the associated challenge level in order to unlock them. Then, you need to use 4-5 Skill Points to buy them. There's also another catch: You can only buy a skill if you've bought an "adjacent" one on the same tier or an adjacent tier, making it a <em>triple</em> unlock at times.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YookaLayleeAndTheImpossibleLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YookaLayleeAndTheImpossibleLair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a></em>, there are various Tonics that can be found throughout the overworld. However, you will then need to spend Quills on any Tonics you've found in order to actually use them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForTheKing">For the King</a></em>, each unlockable item has a condition that must be fulfilled before it appears in the Lore Store, where Lore must be spent to have it show up in the game. About half the item conditions are related to milestones in the main story quest (some items appear in the Lore Store when you attempt the quest for the first time, more the first time you beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a>, and so on); others are related to milestones of other kinds, either numerical (tributing a statue or dedicating a sactum enough times will cause a better kind of statue or sanctum to appear) or qualitative (such as an item of sailor clothing that appears after the first time you sink a boat); still others are related to specific encounters (for instance, the Frost Adventure quest includes a specific random encounter that involves rescuing a trapped monk, who declares that he's going to become an adventurer too, after which the Lore Store begins offering the Monk as a playable character class).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameAndWatchGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameAndWatchGallery">Game &amp; Watch Gallery</a></em>: Each game has a museum featuring demo versions of <em>Game &amp; Watch</em> titles. The only game where you can actually play them is <em>4</em>. The more stars you collect, the more titles you can access. Once every exhibit has been opened, you can play them by earning even more stars in the order they were accessed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO">Pokémon GO</a></em> has tons of cosmetics locked behind a paywall that you have to spend real money to get.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza">Yakuza</a></em> flirts with this in some games.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza0">Yakuza 0</a></em>, the outer portions of each character's skill tree is locked and cannot be unlocked without progressing through that characters respective money-making minigame (Real Estate Royale for Kiryu, Cabaret Club Czar for Majima). Once the blocks have been removed, then you can buy the unlocks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a></em> has some double and even some triple unlocks. One example is the Komaki Tiger Drop. First, you have to clear the part of the storey where Kiryu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fights an actual tiger</span>, which unlocks the ability to remember how to do the move from the Accupuncurist, and then you spend the Exp in order to unlock the move.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tomba">Tomba!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game's most basic mechanic is a unique "Mission" system. Performing certain actions in the game triggers an exclamation point to appear above Tomba's head and the mission's title appearing on the screen. The mission is then recorded in the Quest subscreen—with no indication of how to actually <em>complete</em> the mission. Some missions are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">so obscure as to be ridiculous</a>, while others can be triggered very early in the game but can't be completed until hours later (a classic example: "Peach Flower Gas," which involves catching a Koma Pig under a cloud of gas from a certain flower in the first screen you explore, turning it into a Baby Pig... which can be given to a random NPC in Bacchus Village, the <em>fifth</em> area you explore).
</li><li> There's also the method of catching the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a>, the Evil Pigs. First, you have to find the Evil Pig Bags which are hidden somewhere in each of the areas they've enchanted—the initial one is given to you as a quest item, but all the others must be found by searching every inch of the cursed realm. Once each Bag is in your inventory, it causes its corresponding Evil Pig Gate to appear somewhere in the world, with no indication of where it is (the Red and Blue Fortune Tellers can help you by offering clues, but they themselves are locked—you have to earned a certain number of Adventure Points to have them speak to you—and even then, the clues run the gamut from obvious to extremely obscure). Once you've finally discovered the Gate, you can then enter it and face off against the Pigs themselves in a proper boss battle.
</li><li> The biggest offender goes to the infamous Flower Tower, which is sealed behind <em>five</em> locks. You have to restore Charity Fountain to normal to make the Tower appear, which is an incredibly involved process. First, you must defeat the Purple Bogunsee monsters in the Mushroom Forest to receive an item known as "Rise and Shine Powder." Then you have to find the one flower in the Forest that has not bloomed yet and use the Powder on it; doing that will make the flower blossom and start to cry. You need a special jar to collect the Flower's tears—but that Jar is guarded by the <em>Yellow</em> Bogunsee, which only appear once you defeat the Blue Evil Pig and break the curse on the 100 Flower Forest (which you can't do until you reach the final area of the game, the Underground Maze). Once you finally have the jar of Flower Tears, you can use them to revive Charity Fountain and make the Flower Tower appear again—but even then, you can only enter the Tower if you have an absurdly high amount of Adventure Points.
</li><li> "The Five Golden Items." The 10,000-Year-Old Man is willing to trade his Psychic Fish for these items, each of which can only be obtained by completing a complicated mission:
<ul><li> The Golden Candy requires you to track down items from all over the map; most are in unremarkable treasure chests, while others are themselves rewards for completing missions.
</li><li> The Golden Fruit is given to you by an NPC in Bacchus Village in exchange for giving him lots of Cheese. This is a particular offender because the mission that requires you to give him the Cheese—"Some Cheese, Please"—is completed by finding ten pieces...but he gives you the Golden Fruit for <em>fifteen</em> pieces, so you'll have no idea that you can even continue to give him the items!
</li><li> The Golden Flower can only be obtained by planting Flower Seeds (which themselves only appear after completing another totally unrelated mission) and then completing even more missions, with no indication as to when it will grow.
</li><li> The Golden Leaf Butterfly appears by collecting 29 regular Leaf Butterflies, which appear in both the 100 Flower Forest and the Maskari Jungle (the latter is an area reached <em>very</em> late in the game).
</li><li> And finally, the Gold Medal can only be found by completing a tricky racing mini-game (which requires several missions to even unlock) at the highest level.
</li><li> You can receive an in-game clue as to the location of these items by restoring the Tree of Knowledge to health...which itself requires you to hunt down every single Pump Rock (an accordion-like structure) in the game and then stand on them until they change color.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This is how certain weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> must be unlocked. After completing certain missions in Octo Valley, the player will be rewarded with a set of weapon blueprints. These must be taken to Sheldon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a> and weapons manufacturer in Inkopolis Plaza, who will be able to produce the weapon. However, not only will you still need to purchase the weapon before you can use it in battle, but you'll also have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelLockedLoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelLockedLoot">meet the level requirement</a>. The Hero Weapon replicas add an extra step to the mix, as their blueprints are found in missions that can only be accessed with the proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a>.
<ul><li> The Hero Weapon replicas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> have a similar unlock method, although they thankfully don't require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a> to unlock. Instead of collecting blueprints, Sheldon asks you to complete every mission in the single-player campaign with a given weapon in order to unlock its replica. Once the replica has been unlocked, however, it's subject to the same requirements as above before you can actually use it.

<ul><li> To win the million dollar top prize, the contestant(s) must:
<ol><li> Land on the Million Dollar wedge in one of the first three rounds, which is 1/3 the width of normal wedges and flanked by 1/3-size Bankrupts.
</li><li> Call a letter that's in the puzzle.
</li><li> Solve that round's puzzle without first hitting a Bankrupt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">Win the game without hitting Bankrupt</a>.
</li><li> Land on the $1,000,000 envelope (which replaces the normal top prize of $100,000), one of 24 envelopes on the Bonus Wheel.
</li><li> Solve the bonus puzzle. Despite all of these barriers, it's happened three times since the wedge's introduction.
</li></ol></li><li> From Season 29-36, the show also had the ½ Car tags in the second and third rounds. Both of these must be claimed, either in one round or a combination of two rounds, to win a car. It's made slightly easier in that, if one tag is picked up in a round, it is replaced in the next one (unless of course, the car is won).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChase">The Chase</a></em>, contestants must triumph against the chasers twice before they can win any money. First, they must compete with the chaser to answer a set of multiple questions to bank the money they've earned from the cashbuilder round. Then, the team must participate in a "final chase" where they must correctly answer more questions than the Chaser within 2 minutes to actually claim their prize.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef">MasterChef</a></em>:
<ul><li> Winning the Immunity Pin takes two steps. The first round is a rapid challenge, and the contestants are asked to either cook a dish in 1 hour, or guess certain food ingredients, etc. The winner of the first round must then have a cook-off against a professional guest chef — if they win, they get the Immunity Pin, if not, they get nothing.
</li><li> In perhaps the most negative sense of the trope, team elimination also have multiple stages. The contestants participate in a series of challenges (similar to the ones required to win immunity), and the numbers are whittled down until one ultimate loser is eliminated.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury">Sale of the Century</a></em>: In the U.S. television game show's end game, during the Winners Board era, a contestant could win only the two top prizes on the board — the car and $10,000 — by first matching it with one of the two "WIN" cards on the board.

In its most basic sense, by having Jesse's nephews, Bo and Luke framed and arrested for a crime they didn't commit, making them stand trial and sending them to prison, he hopes that Jesse will be forced to sell the farm to Boss, who then plans to use the farm for his own nefarious, selfish schemes and/or make a large profit.
</li><li> Stand up comedian Dara Ó Briain invokes <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4AmIKhfr40">a meta example of this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; on the basis that he's a working parent with barely any time, he finds this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a> expects him to unlock specific songs despite the fact he already bought them:
<div class="indent">The game says "No! You have to unlock it! That's the way the game works!" and you go "Yeah, I'm thirty-eight. <em>I unlocked it in a shop with a credit card: give me my fucking content.</em>"
</div></li><li> Use Amazon Music's services, and you may find you can't access a song you've already paid for because it was moved to Amazon Music Unlimited without warning. What's more, the music content access afforded by Amazon Prime is depreciating in value, because more of those tracks have been moved to unlimited as well. This means that if you want to listen to any such music on Amazon, you have to pay extra money by the month.
</li><li> Treasure Trails basically use a recursive version of this concept. Each clue gives you the information you need to find the next clue, with only the last clue telling you where the prize is.
</li><li> Ever open a Barbie doll before? It's hard work!
<ol><li> Open the box, and pull out the cardboard slab she's tied to.
</li><li> Untwist the metal ties around Barbie's arms, legs, and torso, and pull them through the holes in the cardboard.
</li><li> Remove the plastic binding Barbie's hair.
</li><li> Remove Barbie's accessories, taking care to account for the hairbrush which is almost always included.
</li></ol></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> got into this for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Friendship is Magic</a></em> line. You'd think Hasbro bought a tape company, given the <em>huge</em> amount of it usually holding the packaging closed and the pony's mane in place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> toy reviews tend to skip the unboxing, because it would take up at least half of the video otherwise. The way it works with a standard "Playful Pony" is:
<ol><li> Remove the clear plastic front of the package from the cardboard back. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ttfb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ttfb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ttfb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This requires either removal of (a lot of) tape, or a strong and sharp pair of scissors.</span>
</li><li> Remove the tape from the pony's hair, and possibly at least one of their legs as well.
</li><li> Remove the plastic binding from the pony's hair. (Yes, they put tape on top of the binding!)
</li><li> Remove various accessories, which may also be taped to the cardboard backing. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note76z57');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note76z57" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note76z57');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A comb is nearly always included. Prepare to have a huge collection of colorful combs if you wind up collecting these toys.</span>
</li></ol></li><li> Advanced-level courses in education systems often work like this. Such a course will often list only one or two prerequisite courses...each of which in turn may have its own set of prerequisites, and so on. Sensible departments will have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree">Tech Tree</a> that shows a map of courses and what other courses they unlock.
</li><li> Anything to requires a license to own counts, since you must first acquire the license (which may be easier said than done) and then buy the thing you want.
</li><li> Prior to the June 2014 Xbox Live update, accessing third party services (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a>, etc.) on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> required both a paid account to the service in question <em>and</em> an Xbox Live Gold subscription.
</li><li> Until 1999 in Volleyball only the team that served the ball in a play could score a point, while the other team had to win a play first to serve the next one. It was changed to both sides being able to score since to make the game length more predictable.
