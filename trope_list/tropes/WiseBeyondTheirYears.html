</p><p>There are many ways to show that children are wise beyond their years: Kids who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">found themselves the head of a family</a> and take their responsibilities seriously, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> who actually treats their duty in a way an older hero does and doesn't simply see it it as an adventure, the teenager who refuses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthIsWastedOnTheDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthIsWastedOnTheDumb">a stupid prank</a> under all pressure, the cunning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a> capable of planning and backstabbing that would make an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> proud
</p><p>There may be a reason why these kids are what they are. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> (or even worse, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageWasteland">Teenage Wasteland</a>) could force a kid to mature very fast, and a traumatic enough life could burn the childhood out of the most extreme and tragic examples of this trope. However, some of these characters are simply like this by nature.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope applies to a good portion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> characters, probably to appeal to a young audience while still being able to let the characters exhibit more mature behavior, like engaging in fierce combat or taking up leadership roles. This consequently makes such characters more relatable to a mature audience as well, as long as it's done well and the matter of young age doesn't raise too many eyebrows.
</p><p>Note that this is based on the mentality of the character. Just being shoved into an adult role won't cut it; the average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a> tend to be highly immature, after all. Intelligence tends to be different from maturity as well, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Kid Geniuses</a> can invent hyperdrives in their backyard but act in a very childish manner everywhere else. A good number of kids under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a> count, but if the kid is in a high-ranking position and still thinks like a kid, they won't fit here.

If the character has an outgoing personality, they might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthyKid">Mouthy Kid</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker">Little Miss Snarker</a>, and when this character's maturity is displayed in a villainous light, they may become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>.

If a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> acts like an adult in a child's world, rather than being thrust into the adult one, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingYourIntellectualAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingYourIntellectualAge">Acting Your Intellectual Age</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, the two young boys at the nursery act unusually mature for their age.

</div></li></ul><ul><li> Shiro Kabuto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> seems pretty mature for his age (specially compared with Kouji), and actually he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmarterThanYouLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmarterThanYouLook">smarter than he looks</a>. This is because Shiro is a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">Iron Woobie</a> is forced to life on his own withou a parents' care. His parents were dead, it is implied his grandfather Juzo spent most of his time building Mazinger-Z, and Kouji is busy handling the household jobs and going to school, thus leaving him alone. And let's not forget <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his supposedly dead father was too busy building Great Mazinger to take care of them AND tell them he was alive.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, Kagaya Ubuyashiki is a man of deep wisdom, far more than befits his age of only twenty three. He's seen as far wiser and more mature than men many years his senior. The most notable thing is the fact Kagaya managed to make Himejima, whos 4 years older, consider him, the younger person, to be his father figure.
</li><li> The human cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> exhibited a maturity way beyond their 10 to 11 years, one of several possible reasons their ages were raised in the English adaptations.
<ul><li> Every season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> has one of these even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>'s Bokomon, who is the level named "child" in Japanese and who speaks and acts like a graduate student specializing in Digital World Mythology.
<ul><li> Henry/Jian of "Tamers" takes the cake though. It is stated above he's 10-11 in the Japanese version, yet he can hack almost any computer system if you give him a good reason, and uses the word incorrigible in a relatively casual conversation.
</li><li> Mikey, Nene, and Christopher from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em> act more mature than most adults, and they're only 13.
</li></ul></li><li> Sora and Joe are the most mature of the original cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, and as such take up the roles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a> respectively while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Tai</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Matt</a> fight over leadership, thinking of responsible things like how they will get food, what best course of action to take, and how to keep the group together. Tai later matures up later in the season as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first time we see the 9-year-old heroine Nanoha she's pondering the direction and purpose of her life. Later, when she discovers her powers, she almost immediately takes a responsible view of them akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, except her wakeup call was <em>property damage</em> rather than the death of a loved one. Her parents also don't seem to mind their daughter taking time off from school to chase after magical artifacts.
</li><li> The series also introduces us to Hayate. A wheelchair-bound 9-year-old who takes care of the Wolkenritter as their mother figure. Even before then, she had been living independently for who knows how long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">after her parents died</a>. You'd expect that her guardian would at least have an adult look after her, especially considering her disability. In any event, it's highly unlikely that any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">social service</a> would let this one slide.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, Hayate, looking back on her childhood in Sound Stage M4, laments that she feels as though she hasn't grown up since then. Signum then responds that she has grown up at a reasonable pace, and that by comparison, Fate grew up too quickly.
</li><li> Several other characters are like this as well, especially the calm and mature (if originally single-minded) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> Fate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a> Yuuno and interdimensional cop Chrono (who actually starts off under the command of his own mother in a sort of pseudo-subversion). One can assume that either Midchilda does not have the same cultural or legal expectations about Age of Majority that most Earth cultures do, or very clear laws allowing exceptions.
</li><li> The only real aversion is Vivio, who actually acts like the 6-year-old she's supposed to be. Although this only applied when she was 6. By the time she hits 10, she's just as mature as everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> has Mikan, the main character's little sister, as one of the most mature characters in the cast. Except for not hitting puberty yet, of course.
</li><li> Doremi's sister Pop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em>, so much that her parents let her go on a train trip by herself. She's <em>five</em> years old at the time. Although it's clear at least that their mom Haruka <em>was</em> worried, as she asked Doremi to keep an eye on her after Pop had gone.
</li><li> Anna Kushina of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em>, particularly in season 2 after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she Awakens as the new Red King</span>. Probably due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">empathic powers</a> - if she's able to understand all sides to an argument, that gives her the experience to understand all different sorts of people enough to be truly wise, even at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe">age 11</a>.
</li><li> Every single member of the Arcobaleno in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> qualifies. Reborn himself could be a serious contender for poster boy of the trope, even before we knew the other six. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted Trope</a> as it turns out that they're all adult assassins cursed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">appearance of infants</a>.</span>

<ul><li> This gets covered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> during second half of the Mahora festival arc, where just about everybody states that Negi is too young to be thinking about the moral implications of protecting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>. Later on, he gets all sorts of speeches about how he should just act like a normal kid and stop worrying about everything. None of them penetrates his thick skull.
</li><li> Negi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of this trope as he literally has no idea how to be a child. Once when he was on vacation and was supposed to just have fun he tried approaching it the same way he does everything else: by carefully analyzing the situation and coming up with most efficient solution, until Asuna told him he should just relax for once.
</li><li> There's also Yue. Fourteen-year-old high school student versed in philosophy and Negi's sounding board for moral dilemmas.
</li><li> Chisame also qualifies, as she arguably has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">best grip on reality</a> out of everyone, and Jack Rakan even identifies her as being the advisor that Negi benefits most from.

<ul><li> It's hard to remember how young the children and teenagers are in this manga. Ichigo, Sado, Orihime and Uryuu start off as fifteen year olds, but are far more mature than their age wound indicate. Some of their classmates are the same, such as Tatsuki. Their Shinigami peers are the same: Renji, Rukia, Kira, Hinamori, Ganju, etc., are all teens but behave like adults.
</li><li> Hitsugaya is (biologically) only 12-13 years old but doesn't behave like a typical child his age due to having been thrust into the role of youngest captain in history. Aizen works out that the truth is obscured and that Hitsugaya does actually have the in-built weaknesses associated with his biological youth (such as lacking both the life experience and emotional maturity of a grown adult). When Aizen triggers this weakness, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">ignition</a> of Hitsugaya's emotions into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> (and the other captains' inability to have foreseen this weakness) spells disaster for everyone.

As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> most of the cast would qualify but Shikamaru is the best example.
</li><li> Itachi and Kakashi's backgrounds cast them as even more extreme cases: Itachi graduated the academy top of the class at 7 (all of the main cast did that at 12), passed the chuunin exams at 10, and became an ANBU captain at 13. He joined Akatsuki at <strong>14</strong> or <strong>15</strong>. Kakashi graduated at <em>five</em>, passed the chuunin exam <em>one year later</em>, and became a jonin under special condition at 13.
</li><li> Another good example is Sasuke, who was designed <em>specifically</em> to be in this trope as a contrast to Naruto. The author even revealed that he had trouble drawing him at first because he had a lack of experience in drawing characters who are "wise beyond their years".

The fact that he rarely smiles and is exceedingly serious, not to mention he <em>runs his own company</em>, despite being only perhaps in his late teens/early twenties is actually commented on by several of the characters, notably Joey, Tristan, and Tea. Plus, the guy beat a chess grandmaster at age twelve, and then proceeded to turn ten thousand dollars into about ten million dollars in <em>the course of one day</em>, when he had a year to do it.

She also shows a great understanding of people and exhibits a very mature attitude. She's also damn good at her job. However, she is not completely immune from some general characteristics of teens.
<ul><li> Sōsuke is 16-17, and is a sergeant within a paramilitary counter-terrorist force. Although <em>extremely</em> immature for his age about relationships and social skills, he is shown to act very professional and understanding about things involving war.

On one level she understands just how suicidally dangerous being a pilot is, and has made peace with it (at least at first). She also shows impressive understanding of other people's motivations and relations (with the notable exception of Rei — she's aware of Misato/Kaji, just in denial). On the flip side, she is very short-tempered and bratty.
</li><li> There's also Rei, who is cited by another character as seeming "far older" than the rest of them.

Triela and Claes are the only two to have made their peace with the fact they will never see adulthood. Though they deal with the knowledge in opposite ways (despite being roommates).

<ul><li> Maria is continually pointed out to be <strong>not</strong> mature, but intelligent.

<ul><li> Hayate clearly states that he supported his parents starting at 10. His bad luck is more of an informed ability than anything given that he is the main male in a harem story.
</li><li> Though one could argue that that is bad luck considering the amount of physical and mental abuse he suffers because of it. Especially bad luck considering he is surrounded by a harem and yet is forced to be a Chaste Hero until he has enough money to support even one of the girls, which, given his 150 million yen debt, is highly unlikely.
</li></ul></li><li> Hinagiku also has a similar level of maturity, most of the major cast in on the low end of this trope as well, showing maturity beyond what someone would expect from a 16/13 year-old. Even Yukiji seems to have it, when it's not overshadowed by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> tendencies.
</li><li> Also, Wataru.

But 10-year-old Kana takes it to borderline ridiculous levels. Accepting a constant abuse of her older brother Jun and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">preventing people around them from interfere, because she knows he's angry at their dead mother for her absence, and by taking it out to her he's in reality treating her as somewhat of the <em>mother figure</em>? Not even being Jun's blood-sister, but hiding it from him in order to make him feel secure, she devotes herself to finding his real mother. In the manga, while she's <em>about to die</em> it remains her biggest concern — because Jun's gonna need support after she's gone.</span>
</li><li> Fuji-hime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarukanaruTokiNoNakaDe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarukanaruTokiNoNakaDe">Harukanaru Toki no Naka de</a></em> might fit this trope, since she is effectively the team's mentor — even if most of her knowledge comes from her ability to see the future, she is arguably more mature than some of the members of the central cast (whose age ranges from 14 to 32, with Fuji being only ten). <em>Might</em> have something to do with her destiny to assist the main character, but still...
</li><li> Chiru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle">Xabungle</a></em> is all of 8 but consistently manages to be one of the more level-headed characters in a cast of teens and adults. This is significant, since in 1981 children in anime, if they weren't the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">main character or in a cast of mostly kids</a>, were typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a>.
</li><li> Wendy Garret of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em>, who's maybe 13-14, is in many ways more mature than her traveling companion, Van. More importantly, she functions as the moral center for the series, being one of the few characters to think deeply about the moral/ethical issues surrounding The Claw's plan.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> revolves around how Naota rejects his childhood.
</li></ul><ul><li> In the flashback arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> we get young Knives. Levelheaded, charming, genius programmer—<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">one year old</a></em>. He's also got a fair helping of cynicism and subscribes increasingly to a utilitarian philosophy, which eventually propels him into deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a>. But hey. He was unreasonably wise all the same.
<ul><li> Manga child-Knives was actually slightly more childlike than manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Vash</a></em>; he's the source of statements like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">there's no difference between people's hearts and ours, so everyone can learn to understand each other</a>." Both of them still qualify for wise beyond their years for talking philosophy when they look eight and are actually <em>one</em>.
<ul><li> Their response to the Tesla revelation is electing to sit down right there and stay there until they die, rather than running to their mother figure and if not asking her for comfort at least confronting her about her betrayal. Tell me that's not unchildlike.
</li></ul></li><li> Manga Wolfwood was shot for the first time when he was eight or so, and suddenly realized that he wanted to live, after all. Anime Wolfwood was abused and offed the bastard at a slightly older age.
<ul><li> Manga Wolfwood was subjected to medical treatments that aged him at an accelerated rate, and based on the ages of the other kids in the orphanage in the flashback and when he returns, he can't be older than eighteen when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he dies</span>, which makes him no more than sixteen when he met Vash. So he's kind of this for the entire series.
</li></ul></li><li> Little Legato is somewhere between eight and thirteen, probably on the younger side, but his response to Knives appearing and killing everyone but him, including the building they were raping him inside, is uniquely calm, to say the least.
</li><li> And possibly Zazie the Beast, anime version. Or he may be an adult with a hormone condition. Data insufficient.

Ironically in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Black</a> in the fifth generation, his initial characterization arguably actually made him act like how someone the age of previous Dex Holders <em>should</em> have (though even then the Dex Holders of the fifth generation save for Black had the distinction of actually having jobs, one of them even being self-employed and another being <em>an International police officer</em>). Then the <em>X and Y</em> arc showed that X actually was a full-time professional battler as a child, and the <em>Sun and Moon</em> arc has Sun in millions of dollars in debt and Moon as an established pharmacist; it's heavily implied this is normal for the manga universe, however, if the fact that no one seems to think this is strange is any indication.
</li><li> Sasami of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> is this, especially after the first OVA series. Cooks and cleans for the household, the more levelheaded of the bunch, sweet and adorable and closest thing to an adult in the house is Katsuhito, who lives in the shrine instead of in the house. On the other hand, a lot of this may be a cover because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she thinks she's actually just a vessel for Tsunami and that the real Sasami's dead.

</li><li> Weed of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a></em> is supposed to be this trope, though to most of the audience he comes across as being overly nice to the point where he makes bad decisions like letting other dogs that tried to kill him live. Imagine if during any real war, one side let ALL enemies soldiers go after they tried to kill their troops or worse <em>leaders</em> and it readily becomes apparent how stupid Weed's decisions are. It's sending them back to their army to kill again.
<ul><li> Well to be fair, in the manga, it was two random spies that Weed wanted to be merciful to after the spies begged for their lives. These dogs did not actively try to kill Weed or his comrades. The anime for some reason replaced the spies with the assassins <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thunder and Lector</span>. Also in the manga, it is directly shown that Gin had always agreed with Weed's stance on killing, and him seemingly trying to kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hougen</span> was actually a test to see if Weed was a true leader. In the anime, it is the same way but it's not as clearly explained. It's also worth noting that Gin let Sniper live in GNG even though the doberman tried to kill him and his comrades multiple times.

While this is in part due to her competence and Newtype capabilities, it's also justified due to having been made the de facto leader of Axis as a young teen, forcing her to grow up far quicker. While works like <em>Char's Deleted Affair</em> further show her transformation from optimistic wide-eyed girl to embittered if chillingly dangerous woman.

While doing all that, she also somehow finds the time to play the therapist for both of the series' male leads, Kira and Athrun, and eventually brings both (and their mechs) under her banner, which serves to boost her faction's firepower considerably.

</li><li> Tom Davidson, the time- and space-traveler, is another example of this trope as his abilities allows him to see things other people can't (and never will). His description as having a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Gandalf the Grey</a> vibe" pretty much fits like a glove.
</li><li> Tyler Marlocke also falls under this trope, as a normal kid whose being forced to go through a curriculum designed for people with superpowers by his parents, he often has to rely on his innately sensible nature in order to simply survive. After he becomes the de-facto main character, he is able to solve many problems simply through a heaping helping of good, old-fashioned common sense and some rather advanced deductive abilities. It helps that later on he gets occasional supplementary lessons from local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> and Batman expy, Revenant.

Slowly, beginning in <em>Batman and Robin</em>, under the constant tutelage of Dick Grayson and after being given a couple of lessons in teamwork by Tim Drake, sheds his brash cockiness, evolving into an overtly serious, competent but gloomy hero. Basically, a little clone of his daddy. Stephanie Brown, the third <em>Batgirl</em> (not counting Helena Bertinelli) comes actually to pity his utter inability to act his age anymore, being a ten-year-old kid unable to play or interact with other children, but deadly competent in crimefighting and investigation, with snarker-tendencies.
</li><li> Bruce Wayne himself, in several renditions of the mythos, is known to have <em>never smiled again</em> after the unfortunate death of his parents, shedding his childhood at once to hasten his growth into the deadly crime-fighter we know currently.

</li><li> Herald-trainees who take the 'usual' route to Herald (brought to Haven in their early teens) grow up fast. By the time they are full Heralds, around the age of eighteen, they are much older mentally and emotionally. Their bonds to their Companions and fellow Heralds usually hold off the unpleasant consequences of such rushed maturation.
</li><li> Talia's people consider their children adult as early as 13, and with the sort of upbringing she received, she's already something of a "miniature adult" when (at said 13) chosen for a Herald.

<ul><li> Kelson's deft questioning of his father Brion in the first chapter of <em>Deryni Rising</em>. The prince is a couple weeks shy of fourteen, and Brion admires his son's shrewd intellect.
</li><li> Perhaps the best example is the four-year-old Alaric Morgan in <em>Childe Morgan</em>. Alyce is conducting a Naming ritual (which is usually done when the child is seven or eight), and she questions him as part of the ritual:

While most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">child soldiers</a> are there against their will, Otto joined the LRA <em>willingly</em> because he knew his impoverished parents were having a hard time feeding all four of their children. He did this when he was <strong>eight</strong>. (By the start of the story, he's twelve.) He is even smart enough to realize that, despicable as the war is, if he kills his enemies before the adults get their hands on them, he is saving them from a great deal of suffering.

She is childish and talks with a lisp, but has the vocabulary and understanding of someone aged more like eight or nine. This appears to be justified by her divine status. As sovereign of her country, she has a regent but makes adult decisions and intimidates nobles, priests and even traitors into doing her bidding. The one thing they won't let her do is execute someone; she has to be sixteen for that.
</li><li> Having learned to take care of her mother over the years and being naturally responsible, Bella had developed into a very mature person, especially for her age. She even starts out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> by telling the reader that she's prepared to die in the place of someone she loves. Once she's fallen in love with Edward and he leaves her in <em>New Moon</em>, this is subverted as Bella turns out to be immature, whiny and lacking in self-control, as first seen when she throws tantrums at her parents for trying to get her to move back with her mother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub">The Baby-Sitters Club</a></em> suffers from this accidentally, probably due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreAdults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreAdults">Most Writers Are Adults</a> trope. 13-year-olds are given responsibilities most adults in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> wouldn't entrust to a high school senior, such as taking little kids around New York City unsupervised. All the BSC has to do is offer to help and explain that they have an after-school baby-sitting business, whereupon one of the parents they'd worked for would chime in with, "They're very responsible," and bingo, they were treated like honorary adults, no further questions asked. And since eleven is apparently the magic gateway to the Competence Zone, often Mallory and Jessie would be "taking care of" kids who were only a year or two younger than they are.
<ul><li> Also, some of their sitting charges as well (when they're not acting a lot younger than they should be, such as five-year-old Andrew who doesn't know what New Year's is). Take for instance one of the Perkins girls: she's two years old, and yet speaks in complex full sentences and acts more like she's around TEN!

Despite her young age she doesn't have much trouble fitting in amongst her ten to twelve year old friends. Only her rudeness foreshadows her young age.

Jon isn't legally a Stark, but a Snow, and Sansa is a Lannister or a Bolton (depending on the source). She then rather bluntly asks why should she risk Mormont soldiers for a Stark, especially after the losses they suffered last time around.

As a result, he doesn't see the point of even getting up in the morning. Allie then asks him if he thinks about the end of a song when he is performing. He says that he has to focus all of his attention of the part of the song that he is playing or he would never get through it.

</li><li> Aang himself counts later in the series, being only twelve but having the WIS score of 20. But then again, he is the Avatar. He is chronologically a hundred and twelve years old. He was frozen in time for a hundred years, so mentally he was still twelve at the beginning of the series. He matured a lot throughout the show, however. Same can be said for most of his friends, as they are all young and manage to fight armies on a daily basis, almost. A point is made of this in the episode The Southern Raiders. When Katara sets off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to avenge her mother's death with Prince Zuko</span>, Aang makes it a point to advise her several times.

</li><li> Speaking of which, Katara is probably the best example of this.

He made a career out of beating larger armies, and crowned it in his adult life by eating the Delhi Sultanate.

She has a nihilistic point of view on life, especially being well-spoken and eloquent for her age.
</li><li> Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg is even more sensible than most well-known world leaders, as she tears into them for not doing anything about climate change. They call her a realist for a reason.
