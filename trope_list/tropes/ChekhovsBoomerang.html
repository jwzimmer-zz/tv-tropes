Characters thought to be one time bits will show up in given time. Corpses long forgotten will re-emerge.
<ul><li> Remember Kimblee? Guy who blows stuff up, saves Ed once, yada-yada? Well, he's dead and absorbed, so now we don't have to see him ever agai-<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">oh wait, there he is inside Pride, stopping the little bastard from taking over Ed's body</span>. And that is without mentioning his Philosopher's Stone.
</li><li> Remember Havoc's girlfriend? He was finally going to have a great relationship, but then Mustang makes him dump her. Well, that was pretty funny. She won't be coming back aga-<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh hello, Lust...</span>
</li><li> The idea of the exchange with Truth comes back again and again!
</li><li> Well, not completely true: There are a few characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a> that never appear again, but they're just in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> episodes. Even then, some of them still have a (slight) impact on the plot.
</li><li> Even in <em>Brotherhood</em>, based more closely off the manga. You can safely ignore Isaac Mcdougall, the filler character made just for this anime and the subject of the one filler episode, at the end of which he dies, right? There's no way his crazy OC plot will come back in later episodes, right? <em>Wrong</em>.
</li><li> In a flashback to Xerxes, we see Father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lied to the king about where the nation-spanning transmutation circle was centered, leaving the king to get turned into a Philosopher stone with the rest of the country</span>. Near the end of the manga, he pulls this same trick <em>again</em>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the apparent center the heroes were trying to keep Father away from was a decoy; the real one was under his chessboard.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> manga.

</li><li> On the object end of things, there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Grand Meteor, the Rainbow and Silver Wings, the memory firelighter, and Blue's Silph Scope</span> with two or more convenient uses after their initial appearance. There are probably more.

There's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to support the idea that they take place in the same universe.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chao Lingshen's</span> involvement in the plot counts as this; after her first appearance, she functions as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> about a dozen volumes later. Then another dozen or so volumes after that, she becomes plot-important again.
</li><li> Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fate Averruncus</span>. He shows up in the Kyoto arc (volumes 4-6), working as a henchman. Fifteen or so volumes later, he makes a reappearance.

Later, his Knightmare Frame is armed with a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">FLEIYA, which he swears up and down he won't actually use. This lasts until Kallen shows up, full of rage and piloting a superior Knightmare. She tears him to shreds and when the Geass activates, the only way he can "live" is to fire the nuke and kill half of Tokyo.</span> It activates several other times as well, this is just the most noteworthy one.
<ul><li> A number of characters prove to be recurring when we thought they'd only be of the one-shot variety. Most of the characters (the named ones, anyhow) in the series have a series of overlapping relationships, and so show up in multiple contexts. Lady Marianne receives several different interpretations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">none of which we were expecting</a>. As well, Nina Einstein starts as a quiet classmate of Lelouch, who then meets Princess Euphemia and develops a crush, who <em>then</em> attempts to build a bomb in the school basement when said crush <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes crazy and dies</span>, who then shows up a year later building the bomb properly, who <em>then</em> sees it used on Tokyo, and <em>then</em> she finally shows up working for Lelouch, building a device that stops the AU-nuke from being used again. Villetta, one of the first characters to be geassed by Lelouch, proves to be one of the most troublesome for him at various key moments.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>
<ul><li> Uchiha Shisui's only role seems to be to explain whom Itachi killed to get his Mangekyou Sharingan. <em>237 chapters later</em>, it is revealed that the Sharingan that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Danzo hid under his eye bandage</span> belonged to him. He returns again during the Fourth Ninja World War, when his <em>other</em> Sharingan helps <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a resurrected Itachi break from Kabuto's Edo Tensei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a></span>.
</li><li> Sasuke's Shadow Shuriken technique, used once in the first arc, is used again <em>over 350 chapters later</em> when he is fighting Itachi. It returns again another 50 chapters later when Naruto uses it with a <em>Rasen</em>shuriken against Pain.
</li><li> Naruto's Rasenshuriken technique, initially a melee attack, was used a few times during the Immortals Arc. Due to the damage it causes to his own body, the Hokage bans him from using it any further. About 100 chapters later, Naruto gets around the problem by using Sage Mode to convert it to a projectile attack. It still has another limitation in that he can only use it a few times, rendering it useless if it misses the target or the opponent dodges it. He gets around that problem too, about another 100 chapters later, and now it is <em>remote-controllable</em> using his other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>.
</li><li> Upon returning from his training with Jiraiya, Naruto gifts Kakashi one of Jiraiya's novels. He uses it to good effect during Kakashi's bell test. It is never mentioned again until the Pain arc, during which it becomes important to decode a message.
</li><li> Another one of Jiraiya's novels about a battle against a rogue ninja, serves as an inspiration to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Namikaze Minato</span> to choose his son's name. It is brought up again during the Pain arc for a different reason.
</li><li> Way back in chapter 8, Kakashi warns Team 7, after a very poor demonstration of teamwork, that if they do not improve, a time may come when they are forced to sacrifice a team member for their mission. To emphasise the point, he tells Sakura to kill Naruto or else he would kill Sasuke. This situation is played out in Kakashi's backstory, where he had to choose between rescuing his teammate Rin and completing his mission, and eventually leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> what everyone considered Obito's death</span>. The situation appears again in <em>Nagato</em>'s backstory later, where he had to choose between killing either of his two teammates, and <em>that</em> leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yahiko's death</span>. <em>Still</em> later, it is revealed that Kakashi was a witness to <em>another</em> such situation, wherein to save Konoha, Kakashi was forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kill Rin, who was forcibly made a Jinchuriki for the purpose of attacking Konoha</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> does this frequently with some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hatchi</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laboon</span>) ending up important hundreds of chapters after they were introduced. In fact "Oda never forgets" has become something of a meme among <em>One Piece</em> fandom.
<ul><li> A good example: Ace's tattoo. Looks misspelled, right?

<ul><li> This trope can be applied to numerous cards in the series. Due to the formula, many cards make a single appearance and never show up again. Others are used extremely often. However, if a card is used twice and makes a major comeback in later, more important duels, if they're cards that tip the balance to the hero's favor, and if they're cards the viewer has forgotten about, then the trope applies.

One episode involved a tract of space laced with floating space mines. Another episode had a teleportation device that could make a Gamilon battleship appear out of nowhere. In the second season, long after we'd forgotten about both, Desslok brilliantly combined the two by teleporting a mess of space mines directly in front of the ship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, so they can't fire it without blowing up their own ship.

</li><li> Three examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>:
<ul><li> First theres an early mention that Aleister Chamber is involved with black magic groups, which overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsHobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsHobby">Chekhov's Hobby</a>. Later on he turns out to be part of the Phoenix Society <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and tries to use the Bizarre Dolls for his own purposes.</span> In the next arc, his connections to the Phoenix Society <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> allow his nephew, Edgar Redmond, to contact the Undertaker.</span>
</li><li> During the School Arc, the elephant that Soma rides into school on also becomes important twice- and yet it still manages to be hilarious every time it shows up. First it gets spooked and destroys Maurice Coles room, forcing him to share with Soma and giving Soma the chance to catch him sending notes to his underlings and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> get photos of his real face.</span> Then Sebastian uses it to transport water during the fire.
</li><li> In the both seasons of the anime, Ciels ring has actual plot importance, although this trope only applies in the second season because in the first season it serves an entirely different purpose. It <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> houses his soul, prompting his memory loss and the entire second season.</span> Then a different ring is later used <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to store Aloises soul</span> the same way Ciels ring was used. The effect lasts much longer (in terms of screen time, at least) and plays an even more crucial role in the plot then the first example does.

<ul><li> In volume 6, when Haru is facing down Sieg, he's briefly able to get past his magical defenses by using the Eisenmeteor form of his sword, having realized that magical defenses only work on magic-infused items. Much later, Sieg is facing down Haja the Infinite, who has unlimited magic power. Unable to beat Haja with sheer magic strength, he instead rams him through the heart with a staff devoid of magic, having remembered what Haru said and realizing that Haja would be unable to block it.
</li><li> During the fight with Orge, Musica is able to neutralize one of his goldclaimer techniques, pointing out the basic alchemy process between metals is all the same with the only difference being power. In vol. 32, when Musica attempts to forge a new blade for Haru's Ten Powers sword, he remembers that instance and instead uses his alchemy powers to make the blade instead of trying to master swordsmithing in a short time.

Because of this she only receives half the blast from a petrification gaze and is easily broken out the spell. After about another arc people forget she ever lost an eye at all, until she uses the fake one to see through an illusion.
</li><li> At the end of the Tower of Heaven Arc, Natsu first uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Dragon Force</a> by devouring the highly-concentrated magical energy of the Etherion crystals to defeat Jellal. At the climax of the Nirvana Arc, Jellal, now an amnesiac good guy who vaguely remembers the events of said arc, gives Natsu a power up in the form of his remaining magical energy in a powerful flame spell so Natsu can use Dragon Force again to defeat Zero. Then Sting and Rogue at the climax of their fight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Grand Magic Games</a> reveal they can use Dragon Force without an outside source. <em>Then</em>, in the Tartaros Arc Wendy remembers how Natsu activated Dragon Force and replicates it via absorbing the high ethernano concentration in the air around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">Face</a> to activate her own version and fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Ezel</a>, while Natsu manages to tap into Dragon Force against Mard Geer without an outside source of energy on his own. Finally, during the final arc Wendy reveals she can use Dragon Force naturally after training, Gajeel obtains it by absorbing the Demon Barrier Particles of Bloodman, and Natsu once again uses it without outside help to help defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a>.

</li><li> In the Tartaros arc, it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Igneel and the other dragons used the Dragon Soul technique to enter the Dragon Slayers' bodies to both protect them and to extend their own lifespans after being fatally injured long ago by Acnologia, thus explaining their long disappearance.</span> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FairyTailDragonCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FairyTailDragonCry">Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Animus is revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to be a dragon that used that same technique to save himself and a dying Sonya after he was fatally injured by Acnologia, but because Sonya wasn't a Dragon Slayer he couldn't free himself like they could, which is why he sought out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Dragon Cry</a> to give himself the power to free himself from her body.</span>

<ul><li> Actually used twice. The "Blackest Night" Prophecy was also used in the early 1990's when the Green Lantern Corps was destroyed for the first time, after when Hal Jordan went mad with grief and became Parallax. "Blackest Night" was also the title of one of the comics leading to the end of that same arc, implying that Parallax/Jordan caused the Blackest Night. The Universe has since been rebooted and the prophecy retconned, however, so it's likely that in canon the first occurrence was just a warm-up.
<ul><li> The first one didn't include Sodam Yat or Ranxx the Sentient City, both mentioned in the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> story.

It was first introduced mid-season as a plot device to drive the conflict between the heroes and villains for a couple of episodes, and, knowing Power Rangers, you would expect it never to be used again, but, at the end of the season/transition between series, it comes back as a way to restore the Power Rangers to their adult forms and give them new powers.
</li><li> Unsurprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> has versions of this, since its footage is used for Power Rangers. Nearly every series has had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">a movie in theaters</a>, and in recent years there has almost always been an exclusive powerup of some sort introduced, either for the rangers, their mecha, and sometimes both. They would then later be remembered by the rangers arbitrarily at some point later in the season and used only once, maybe twice before its end. (Sometimes after its end with the teamup movies) The only series so far with repeated use of the movie powerup in-series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger">Shinkenger's</a> Kyoryuu Origami Disc.

Demonstrating amazing knowledge of the Stargates' programming, he modifies it to spread throughout the whole Stargate network, shutting down every 'gate in the universe before they manage to reverse the effects. Then, a number of episodes later, they need to get an Ancient super-weapon working to wipe out the Replicators (who threaten to consume all matter in the galaxy), and it comes up that they need to figure out how to dial every Stargate in the galaxy simultaneously.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jacob/Selmak:</strong> I have no idea how to alter a Stargate to perform such a function. I don't know of anyone who can. <br/><strong>Sam:</strong> I think I know someone.

You didn't expect this to become a standard trick in every subsequent series.
<ul><li> A new shield enhancement that allowed a ship to fly into a star's corona was introduced as a mere plot device for a minor episode, but reappeared not long after in a major episode when they used it during a battle with the Borg.

He winds up using it to kill a centaur named Nessos who meant to rape his (current) wife, Deianeira. Before he dies, though, the Nessos tells Deianeira to take his blood and use it as a love potion on Heracles, if the need should ever arise. She does so, and when she hears about Heracles' interest in the woman Iole, she anoints his clothes with it. The next morning, as Heracles burned sacrifice to the gods, the heat from the flames caused the Hydra's blood to eat away at his flesh, leading to his death. And then those arrows are used <em>again</em> by Philoctetes to mortally wound Paris during the Trojan War.

At the denouement of Act 1, the curse is pronounced by Count Monterone, on the court jester Rigoletto, as revenge for the latter's part in (and subsequent mockery of) having provided Monterone's daughter to the Duke of Mantua as one of his many mistresses in debauched parties. At the end of Act 2, it is Rigoletto's own daughter Gilda who is carried off by the courtiers to be the Duke's next plaything, with Rigoletto tricked into helping them. The curse having now struck, Rigoletto believes the worst has happened: and witnessing Monterone being dragged off to jail, swears that he will be the instrument of the old man's revenge on the Duke (whom he also cursed). Rigoletto engages an assassin to murder the Duke on one of his incognito amorous adventures around town: however, the assassin's sister falls in love with the Duke, they agree to substitute another target - the next random stranger to knock on the door of their inn. The whole scene has been overheard by Gilda, who decides to die for her "lover" even though he has now spurned her, and knocks on the door herself. Rigoletto, coming back for the body, discovers his daughter dying, and realises that Monterone's curse has struck for a second time. (Meanwhile, the Duke gets off scot-free, so much so that he never even so much as learns there was an assassination attempt against him, and the assassins never even learn that their intended target was the Duke...)

<ul><li> Not all that uncommon in the other <em>Zelda</em> games, as the player's inventory can become rather stuffed.
</li><li> One of the more prominent examples is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>. Early in the game, Link, when talking to the mayor before leaving town, has to catch a runaway goat, stopping it in its tracks and throwing it to the side.

<ul><li> Also required in one case to get another upgrade. In fact, Security Hall almost seems like an aversion of the "You need the Mystic Melody to get the Lost Chao" rule until you remember that you needed the Mystic Melody to get the Treasure Scope, found in that very level, which <em>was</em> necessary to get the Lost Chao.

Thing is, you may not realize the last one.
<ul><li> Then there's the third game with Magnes' rocket. Launching it is the main objective of Echo Ridge Elementary's Science Club, and Luna 4 Prez gets caught up in it to secure votes for Luna. Once it gets launched, players tend to forget about it until the very end — where the same incident that almost caused the rocket to <em>explode</em> gave it the Noise resistance it needs to get close enough to Meteor G for Mega Man to jump from WAZA's Dynamic Station through the rocket into the Meteor Server.

Oh, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>. There are <em>party characters</em> that serve this purpose.
<ul><li> Before that, Melchior in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> is an example of this with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Chekhov's Gunman</a>: He first appears to just be some random merchant, then it turns out he's the forger of the Masamune, and then he turns out to also be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the three gurus of the ancient age of magic</span>.

<ul><li> Sometimes, you use a spell, and later you'll have to cast the same spell <em>backwards</em> to obtain the opposite effect (e.g. open/close)
<ul><li> Loom is a particularly interesting example because there are no items in the game. Most adventure games that require a character to use a 'recipe' for something give that character an item that lists the recipe, so you can turn back to it if you get stuck. In Loom, you have to write the spells down as you find them out, or you are screwed (unless you use a strategy guide, which generally wasn't possible in those days). And even a strategy guide might not help, since some of the spells are randomized for each playthrough.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3">Mega Man 3</a></em>, the Top Spin is used once against a boss like all the other weapons, and then, it being the worst attack in the history of Mega Man, you probably never use it again...which is a shame, because the final boss goes down with one hit of it.

<ul><li> An example of good game design theory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The earlier uses of the incinerator and rocket launcher teach the player, setting up for their combined use in the boss fight.</span>

In the next volume, it's shown that they can be used to quickly acquire one's weapons in case of emergency. When Ruby notices something fishy going on at a communications tower, she walks straight out of the dance party and calls her locker (which leaves a crater on the ground as it lands, by the way) with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">Crescent Rose</a> inside. In volume three the lockers make a comeback during a battle, used by <em>all</em> of the students to get their respective weapons, as well as lockers <em>themselves</em> being used as weapons to strike down a giant monster bird. The same episode involves yet another use of these lockers: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ruby launches one of them towards an airship and <em>flies on it</em> to quickly reach said ship</span>. Thought Rooster Teeth ran out of ideas on how to use them? In the volume three finale we learn the <em>real</em> reason behind the initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGag">Chekhov's Gag</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's established that a person may be stuffed into the locker and launched off to somewhere else without any real harm. Which is exacly what Pyrrha does to him to make sure that he's safe and that he won't stop her from facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">Cinder</a></span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a> authors love Chekhov's Gun and foreshadowing enough that this is getting pretty common. The way a blackmailer got a note past magical wards and into Poe Dorm comes back later as the way someone gets a tracker in Fey's luggage so she can get ambushed at Christmas. The Hawthorne girl in a Carmilla story who has toxic blood? She turns out to be Phase's cousin, who shouldn't even <em>have</em> mutant powers. Or the way that Counterpoint's power mimic ability works. Or Phase's little trick stealing Generator's underwear <em>while she is wearing it</em> keeps coming back. There's a ton of them.
</li><li> Not to forget Tucker's Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em>. First it's a sword, then it's a key. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And when you think they are just going to use it like a sword some more, there are two other instances of them needing to use it as a key!</span>

A running gag for a while is the Panda and Squirrel locating the copies and not only doctoring them to hide their identities, but altering each file <em>differently</em>, with progressively more outlandish backstories, such as one claiming the Red Panda was actually his own commanding officer, Colonel Fitzroy. This initially comes back when Fitzroy is gunned down as part of an attack on the Home Team superheroes' secret identities, and the Flying Squirrel uses the fact Fitzroy was a target at all to deduce the culprit was someone with access to the Home Team file. In later episodes, Canadian government officials make reference to the Red Panda and Flying Squirrel being a reformed mobster and his moll, revealing that the government still has the doctored files and thinks them genuine.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> actually uses this trope a lot, as a consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch">Halfway Plot Switch</a> structure.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of the stories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> &amp; Co.</em> works with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhov's Boomerang</a> returning in the end and solving the plot.
</li><li> This is a common usage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>. Nearly every Fenton invention will be used at least twice in the show, especially if it's unexpected. Special bonus points for one of the weapons for being an actual boomerang!
</li><li> Torgo's Executive Powder from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>. It's got a million and one uses.
<ul><li> And again more recently with Professor Farnsworth's "Disintegration" (actually teleportation) Ray.

<ul><li> Old man Wayne actually pulls useful equipment from his gallery several times, such as his old utility belt when the current Batsuit gets corrupted, or the Grey Ghost's hat and goggles when he needs to hide his identity. It's awesome.

Most viewers are under the impression that the gun was on the mantelpiece (literally), it was used once, and that was that. But he ended up using it almost as much as firebending and it changed the course of the series many times.
<ul><li> Katara's necklace also qualifies. After Zuko ends up with it, and he unsuccessfully tries to use it to force Katara into helping him, you think its purpose is over. Then they reach the Northern Water Tribe, and its real point in the story arc shows itself.
</li><li> Aang's bison whistle.
</li><li> And then there's Sokka's actual boomerang. It makes repeated appearances throughout the show, usually for comedic purposes... then it makes one final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">emotionally-charged</a> appearance in the show's finale, just when you were least expecting it.
</li><li> There's also the Waterbending Scoll. Obtaining it is the source of conflict for one episode, then it can be assumed that any gains Aang and Katara make in their waterbending from then until they reach the Northern Water Tribe can be attributed to the scroll. You wouldn't expect it to serve any purpose after that, but it does show up one more time, as an offering to Wan Shi Tong when he asks for a contribution to his library.
