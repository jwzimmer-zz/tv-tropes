</li><li> This is a major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>. All of the Numbers (except for Number 39: Utopia, <em>maybe</em>) are malevolent beings that corrupt whoever owns them, each causing its host to become drunk with power and become obsessed with it. What's more, the Numbers Holder is driven to find other Numbers by it. There are people, whoever, who are immune to this effect and those who can resist it, mostly Numbers Hunters like Yuma and Kaito, but they usually have some supernatural or technological aid.
<ul><li> This is made even worse because Number cards start blank (the only common point is they're XYZ monsters) and tailor themselves to whoever picks them up, both in deck and personality. And Utopia DOES possess someone who holds it without protection.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gokudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gokudo">Gokudo</a></em> planned to abuse his magic sword in a similar manner as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLast">Dead Last</a></em>, though his genie stops him before he can even try.
</li><li> The G Units from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> cannot be properly removed from their hosts without a specific piece of technology. Tearing out the control metal causes the armor to actually consume its host, but the metal regenerates the host shortly after.
</li><li> The Blue Water from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em>. There's a moment when she throws it into the ocean, only to have it rise from the waves and return to her.
</li><li> When Ichika from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata">Uta Kata</a></em> tries to throw away the charm given to her by Sei, it just flies back to her, signifying that it is too late already to change her fate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalCircleGuruGuru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalCircleGuruGuru">Magical Circle Guru-Guru</a></em> has an award statue that reappears whenever Nike tries to dispose of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: An egg-shaped stone called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Beherit</a> might get lost or change hands temporarily, but is ultimately fated to find its way into the hands of the person who is destined to use it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummoningArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummoningArtifact">summon</a> the God Hand for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> in their moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">deepest despair</a>. According to Flora, if it is meant for you, then even if you throw it away it will find its way back to you. If it is meant for someone else, then no matter how you cling to it it will somehow escape your grasp. A good example of this is how the jailer accidentally drops Griffith's Crimson Beherit down a drain, so that it is seemingly lost forever. However, Zodd assures Griffith that it will come back to him when the time is right, and so it comes to pass: When Griffith ends up crippled and broken in the shallows of a lake, the beherit finishes its trip downstream from the dungeon's drain and appears before Griffith exactly when he needs it.
</li><li> The Silver Crystal from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>. Despite the canon belief it can be taken, and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> it is passed on, present Usagi always, <em>always,</em> has a copy of it. Even when Chibi-Usa takes the future version, Usagi still has the past version. Usagi eventually gets that copy back as well. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a>, Chibi-Usa even gets a new pink crystal so Usagi can keep the Silver Crystal. Not that she's <em>trying</em> to get rid of it.
</li><li> A "kinda" example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Legendz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Legendz">Legendz</a></em>: in the first episode, Shuu tries to get rid of his Talispod, but the wind blows it back to him.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> OVA, Naga, on pure impulse, puts on a valuable bracelet made out of rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orichalcum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orichalcum">Orichalcum</a>. Unfortunately, she discovers that she can't take it off. And what's more, a powerful superweapon became attracted to the bracelet and Naga and Lina got chased all over by this creature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>: Kazuki Muto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection">First Episode Resurrection</a> involved replacing his destroyed heart with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlchemyIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlchemyIsMagic">alchemical device</a> known as a kakugane. This sees Kazuki begin his life as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero">Stock Shōnen Hero</a> , and halfway through the series we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the kakugane is of the black variety, which tends to make the user absurdly powered, but he has to nourish on other people's energy to subsist</span>.
</li><li> The title item of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade">Witchblade</a></em> is a strange bracelet that turns the user into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">Stripperific</a> death machine. Its clingyness is demonstrated in a sad sequence when Masane tries to get it off... using dangerous tools that could cost her an arm. At one point it wakes up, slices a press into ribbons and goes back to sleep. Worse, if Masane dies, it passes on to her daughter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually she sacrifices herself, taking the Witchblade with her.</span>
</li><li> Ichigo's Hollow mask in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>. If removed from his person it will disintegrate into nothing, but it always reappears on him, appearing to block fatal blows early on. When his Hollow gains enough power to start interfering in Ichigo's fights, it becomes downright dangerous. The "Hollow" is revealed much later to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Zanpakutou spirit Zangetsu</a>; the "Old Man" really being a manifestation of his Quincy heritage. Ichigo can't get rid of it because it's part of his own soul, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">accepting it as a part of himself</a> is quite the part in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>: Kaijinbou forges <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">Toukijin</a> but cannot get rid of it. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">controls</a> his will, driving him to hunt Inu-Yasha and eventually (accidentally) killing Kaijinbou through sheer force of power. Death doesn't separate them, Toukjin just animates Kaijinbou's body and keeps going. In the end, Inu-Yasha has to hack off the smith's wrist to separate them, which allows the dead body to disintegrate, leaving Toukijin behind.

No amount of efforts can remove it (panda Genma gets near it with a pair of scissors, but the devil dog's face <em>eats them</em>). The only way to get rid of this curse is to fulfill the swimsuit spirit's wish before the sunset... or it will drag Ranma to the bottom of the sea.

<ul><li> In the card game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em>, there is a curse called "cursed thingie". It curses an equipped Item, which then doesn't give any bonuses anymore and can't be removed voluntarily. The result is, that it still occupies its slot (for example footgear), therefore blocking it. Therefore, the cursed player wants it on an item which is small and does not occupy a slot or hand. The other players want it on something that occupies both hands or a slot and is big, for maximized inconvenience.

She liked the power it gave her — enough power to kill two of her demonic masters — but the multitude of spirits in the Veil itself are just as eager to enslave her. And while her mind might want to throw it away, her hands refuse to obey. At one point, she even tries summoning a skeleton and ordering it to take the Veil from her. The skeleton does so, then quickly falls apart as the magic that animated it fades. As it falls, the Veil "coincidentally" drapes itself over her arm. The spirits of the Veil explain to Liliana that they are not done with her yet, and that deep down she doesn't really want to be rid of the Veil either. They even point out that she put on the Veil again during their conversation, and she didn't even notice it was on her face before they mentioned it.

<ul><li> <em>Pierino e il burattino</em> (<em>Peter and the Puppet</em>, an Italian comic, by Antonio Rubino, 1919) used this trope as subject. Obsessively. Although defining the puppet as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> can be excessive: it has no apparent property or power, but it comes always back to its unwilling beholder.
</li><li> One of these features prominently in one of the issues of the Spanish comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MortadeloYFilemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MortadeloYFilemon">Mortadelo y Filemón</a></em>, titled "The Warlock": a magical note, enchanted to kill anyone who reads it. The title characters subsequently try to remove it by the most varied means, chucking it into the bin, shredding it, burying it, tying it to a rock and throwing it to the sea, and <em>hitting it with a full discharge of a flamethrower</em>. And yet the note manages to never be actually harmed due to some kind of karmic immunity that causes people around it to suffer instead. They do manage to get rid of it. How? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">They send it back to the guy that commissioned the warlock to send the note to the Super</a>.
</li><li> A villainous example occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> comics with the Mandarin and his alien rings, which give him a variety of fantastic powers. The rings are attuned to him and cannot be taken from him by force. A partial subversion comes from the fact that the Mandarin can voluntarily lend his rings to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">minions</a>, although if they're knocked out or killed the ring automatically comes back to him. If the Mandarin himself loses consciousness, all the rings automatically reappear on his fingers, which left his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> powerless to stop the Stark employees they had kidnapped from escaping on one occasion after Iron Man knocked out their boss.
</li><li> Shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> on occasion. When Hal Jordan was given a Blue Lantern ring, he was unable to remove it without hoping for something. In a Green Lantern cameo on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>, Kyle Rayner couldn't remove his lantern ring even when he tried. And speaking of Kyle, when he had the original power of Ion, he modified his ring to become exactly this because of all the times people tried to take his ring.

Even having successfully removed this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> from his body, the Web-slinger still isn't free of it: year after year, host after host, it comes back to fight him. It also has a "crazy ex-girlfriend" thing going on, and several comics have stated that it would gladly go back to Peter if he accepted it, which means it's still trying to be even clingier. <br/><br/>It's gotten worse in recent years. The symbiote messed with the physiology of its last two long-term hosts, making them literally unable to survive without it. This forced Mac Gargan to be locked back into an upgraded Scorpion suit, and nearly killed Flash Thompson when the suit possessed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></span>. Numerous stories have seen Venom, Carnage or other symbiotes "permanently bonded" to their hosts such that they can never be removed again. Hell, it's noted in Venom's first appearance that this happened to Eddie Brock. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">It never sticks.</a>

The demon will relentlessly pursue and slaughter the bearer of ring, which can only be disposed of by passing it on to someone without their knowledge, condemning that poor bastard to an extremely horrific death. Conan gets rid of it by slipping it on the finger of that story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>... and then breaking his hand for good measure.

When Captain Haddock tosses it off, it sticks to someone else, who in turn shakes it off. And so it goes all over the bus, before coming to the Captain's cap. It then follows him aboard the plane, eventually makes its way to the cockpit (causing the pilots to momentarily lose control), lands on the Captain again by the end of the flight, is thrown away at the police station, only to return <em>yet again on the captain's clothes</em> in the hotel room!

The guns are cursed, and bonded permanently to her hands. They also lack triggers and never need to be reloaded, apparently firing by themselves and using her as a "host", to bring about vengeance on those who go unpunished for their crimes. She gets an "assignment" by reliving the death of the killer's victim, then involuntarily teleports to the killer's location. One time she tried to kill herself instead, but the guns render her immortal.

At the end he is still unable to get rid of it, and finds a cave filled with thousands of identical copies of the object. After thinking for a bit, he makes them into keychain holders and starts a booming business selling them, as whoever buys one will never lose their keys again.

When she puts them on, they begin forcing her to dance a la the Hans Christian Andersen tale, and she eventually becomes the unwilling star of a Koopa basketball ballet. If Mario and Luigi manage to find her in the desert in one sequence, she'll tell them that she's tried over and over again, but the sneakers just won't come off her feet.
</li><li> The hero of J.H. Brennan's <em>Saga of the Demonspawn</em> gamebooks, Fire*Wolf, comes across a sentient magical sword that he keeps with him because it's a powerful weapon. It's only later that he learns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">he was destined to inherit it</a> and finds he can't get rid of it.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFabledLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFabledLands">The Fabled Lands</a></em> if you earn the favor of Nagil, the god of death, you can be gifted with his White Sword. Besides its staggering +8 combat bonus, you'll have it forever. Even if you die and are brought back to life, you'll lose all the rest of your stuff, but not the sword.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog">Hurog</a></em> series, there is a ring that makes the wearer the owner of the eponymous castle. You only can take it off when you're dying, although there seems to be quite a long timespan between being able to take it off and actually dying. Ward is not happy when that is revealed, mainly because rings are impractical in combat.
</li><li> In the <em>Undead...</em> Series by Mary Janice Davidson, there is the Book of the Dead.
</li><li> The young adult novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEyesOfKidMidas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEyesOfKidMidas">The Eyes of Kid Midas</a></em> features a pair of sunglasses that allow the wearer to change reality any way he wants... but the glasses cannot be removed.
</li><li> The short story "The Zahir" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> involves a variant on this trope. The title object is cursed, causing anyone who sees it to become gradually unable to think of anything else. The main character succeeds in getting rid of the zahir itself, but is unable to get it out of his head.
</li><li> Another Borges example is "Shakespeare's Memory". The narrator — a German Shakespeare scholar — meets a man at a party and unwittingly agrees to accept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>: the personal knowledge of all the experiences of William Shakespeare, recollections of which encroach more and more upon his thoughts, threatening to displace his own identity.

The protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a> acquires a magical walking stick, exact properties unknown. She tries to return it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the fairies</a> several times, but it keeps coming back. A slight twist in that the stick shows up "in places where I live", like in her bed, her car and her work area. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mercy later uses this fact to lure her attacker into a trap. She could have retrieved the stick from any area she spent time in, but only told him about the spot that was protected.</span> Apparently, it also has the power to ensure that all the owner's ewes will bear twins — not particularly useful for a Volkswagen mechanic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It comes in handy in <em>Bone Crossed</em> — apparently it was made by Lugh of the Shining Spear, and so can be used as a spear when needed.</span>

He doesn't actually do much except hang around grinning like an idiot, but he's virtually indestructible and has a knack for overcoming insurmountable obstacles to return to the protagonists whenever something detains him. Not so much a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCatCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCatCameBack">The Cat Came Back</a> because, as it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's an embodiment of pure order that will become one-half of the new Staff of Law when combined with an embodiment of pure magic.</span>

</li><li> The Power of Stormhold in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust">Stardust</a></em>, which Yvaine must carry until the heir of Stormhold asks her for it. But we don't know how clingy it is, because she never actually tries to get rid of it in any other way. In the book, Yvaine's lugging the gem around is explained as an obligation — though it knocked her out of the sky it's not hers, and as stars take obligations very seriously, she can't just leave it. She dislikes having to carry it, but will not get rid of it until the right person asks — that would be inexcusable for any star. A sort of culturally-induced Clingy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>.

After destroying his kingdom and losing his true love he has a narmy sequence where he tries to get rid of it and it stands in the ocean smirking at him and Elric becomes... very dramatic on the topic of realizing he's stuck with it. Bonus points for the illustration: it is in the fantasy-illustration style that includes every tiny detail of his outfit, and he gives an impression of faking female orgasm. Of distress. Possibly fainting, too. Perfectly normal for his type, really.
</li><li> In Katharine Kerr's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry">Deverry</a></em> Series, the Silver Daggers Otho make are usually enchanted to return to him when lost or when their owners dies (something he neglects to mention to the mercenaries who "rent" them from him). However, Rhodry's dagger, due to an attempt to remove its glowy anti-Elf charm, starts seeing Rhodry as its true owner, and finds him under any circumstances. Including politically risky ones.
</li><li> A dragon scale keeps appearing in the path of the heroes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em>One Good Knight</em> in her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms">Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms</a></em> series. Fortunately, Sir George knows better than to disturb it; they eventually find that a fox has been following them and moving it around.

The Luggage is made of sapient pearwood, a rare wood that grows in high-magic areas. <em>Anything</em> made of sapient pearwood gains virtual immunity to magic and the ability to follow its owner anywhere in the multiverse, which is why a traveling chest made of sapient pearwood is said to be more valuable than anything and everything that said chest could possibly contain. And given that it's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a>, that can be quite a lot of stuff.

Later still, Granny Weatherwax makes some remarks hinting she anticipated something like this might happen, even asking what kind of fish Tiffany found the necklace in.
</li><li> The sentient hellblade Kring — or possibly a purgatory blade — was thrown into a very deep sea from a very great height by an owner who had been driven to insanity by its continual boring chatter. A parody of Moorcock's <em>Stormbringer</em> (see above), it shares a few characteristics, except, unfortunately, Stormbringer's ability not to sink in water.
</li><li> Considering that the Discverse is largely made up of Narrativium, this is just an example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality">Theory of Narrative Causality</a> at work.

Unfortunately, the pearl is cursed: no-one will <em>buy</em> it, and if thrown away or given away it will always return to the current owner (even if it has to animate a corpse to carry it back). It can however be transferred by being <em>stolen</em>, which half the time involves the murder of the current owner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMisenchantedSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMisenchantedSword">The Misenchanted Sword</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LawrenceWattEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LawrenceWattEvans">Lawrence Watt-Evans</a> is about a sword that is a flawed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">Clingy MacGuffin</a>. It makes one almost invincible in single combat (against adult males) about 100 times — then will pick a new owner and kill its old owner. And each owner will get betrayed faster. When sheathed the sword must stay within a certain distance from the wielder, but it becomes far more clingy once drawn and prior to killing; the blade must maintain contact with the wielder at all times. Trying to throw it away or hide it won't work, and is dangerous — the spells used cause an earthquake to return it at one point. On the other hand, nothing <em>except</em> the sword can kill its owner. The way the owner deals with it is refreshingly different than you'd expect: he used it as a mantle piece. Someone tried to steal it, and the resulting chaos almost wrecked his bar. Finally he got tired of it and just kicked it under his bed.
</li><li> The title painting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s short story <em>The Road Virus Heads North</em>, which not only shows scenes of mayhem occurring in its wake, suggests that the subject of the painting is following the protagonist and fully intends to kill him as well when he catches up. It is suggested that the painting cannot be gotten rid of or destroyed by any means. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's also suggested at the end that the painting isn't actually a painting, but part of its painter's ghost; the other part is hunting after the protagonist.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CymbalBangingMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CymbalBangingMonkey">creepy monkey</a> in King's short story "The Monkey" is also resilient and extremely hard to get rid of.
</li><li> The One Ring from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> could perhaps be considered one of these: there's a moment, for example, in the first chapter of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, when, as Bilbo is preparing to leave the Shire, Gandalf persuades him to "stop possessing it, give it to Frodo", and Bilbo agrees, but as he walks out, Gandalf stops him: "You have still got the ring in your pocket." The Ring also attempts to compel its wearer to put it on when a Ringwraith gets near. However, it could also be seen as a partial subversion of this trope, as it also has a tendency to slip off the bearer's finger unexpectedly, often when it is most needed; this is how it came to Bilbo after slipping off Gollum's finger. It also slipped off of Isildur's finger, revealing him to a band of orcs, thereby betraying him to his death. <br/><br/>In the book it is noted that <em>even if thrown into the sea</em> it would eventually find its way back to civilization by compelling some fish to eat it, and if <em>buried under a mountain</em> it would gnaw on the minds of the person who knew its whereabouts. (And imagine having the willpower to throw even an ordinarily priceless item such as the diamond in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em> into the sea.) Anyone sufficiently powerful to safeguard it would be tempted to claim it and become the new Ring lord, and it would try to slip away from anyone sufficiently weak to avoid temptation or ability to wield it — and slip into the hands of someone who could. <br/><br/>The film explained this fairly concisely. The ring cannot be destroyed, except for within Mount Doom. The Ring cannot be guarded, buried or lost again; it will always call out to the nearest person to possess it, and cannot be resisted for long. The Fellowship could not be avoided. However, its ultimate goal is always to return to its creator. Though no characters bring up the issue in advance, this all begs the question of why its psychic influence would allow someone to intentionally carry it to the volcano and throw it in, and in the end it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroying it on purpose is impossible, but it <em>can</em> be destroyed by accident. Frodo and Sam reach the necessary lava pit but cannot bring themselves to throw it in, despite their racial resistance to its power. Gollum shows up, steals the ring and, while celebrating his success, trips and falls into the lava. In the movie version he falls in when Frodo attacks him to take the ring back (for himself, not to destroy it).</span>
</li><li> Another Tolkien example, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, is the Silmarils and the Necklace of the Dwarves (which was built around one of the Silmarils). Morgoth is unable to part with the Silmarils even though their holy light burns him, and later Beren is unable to throw away the Necklace when he is told to, instead giving it to Lúthien to wear.

The curse, so to speak, comes from the fact that it was usually passed on by lethal force. This isn't a requirement, but since very evil people tend to be the most covetous of its power it's no surprise that murder is a common method of "defeating" the current owner.

Yes, those who acquire it do so deliberately and in full knowledge of the cost, and the thing is not <em>intrinsically</em> troublesome, but earning it elevates one to a rank that carries grave responsibilities for all its wearers; promotion to the elite ("Unattached" status) carries a 90% mortality rate (and the survivors are mostly artificial parts); and you <strong>can't ever give the thing away</strong> because it'll kill anyone who comes into more than fleeting contact with it. Come the final battle against the Eddorians, even Lensmen long since retired are required to do their bit.

A naughty girl named Kitty puts on a pair of new shoes that force her to behave, and that won't come off her feet when she tries to remove them. The shoes do have their upside, as when Kitty starts trying to be nice the shoes actively help her do it. They also give her the ability to talk to animals and even start teaching her how to dance.

As soon as he picks it up, Arthur experiences a strange sensation and says "I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill him. Why?" He later appears to be come under the supernatural influence of the sword and attacks Fenton with it.

She tries to get it sawed off, but the bowler she borrowed it from pleads with her not to do it, since it was a memento of his dead wife. Ally is forced to take the ball with her to the office the next morning, just as they're about to try an important case.

It wouldn't come off and was seemingly indestructible (it was unaffected by Clark using a grindstone on it). He considered cutting his finger off, but Chloe begged him not to, so he didn't try. It took the power of the Fortress of Solitude to get rid of it.

As soon as Matthew uses it to kill his wife Sandra for having him sent to prison for abusing her, the gun became fused to Matthew's hand and all attempts to remove it failed.

It goes back to Ancient Greece, but appears in folklore in many variations: The oldest version is probably the story of Polykrates, tyrant of Samos, as recounted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories">The Histories</a></em> by Herodotus of Halicarnassus (5th century BCE). Polykrates threw a precious ring into the sea as sacrifice to the gods, because his friend, the pharaoh Amasis, was afraid that Polykrates' legendary luck might anger the gods and they would destroy him. A few days later, a fisherman caught a beautiful fish and brought it to his king as a gift. When the fish was cooked and cut open, Polykrates' ring was found in its belly. A bad omen, since this meant that the gods had rejected the sacrifice. The German poet Friedrich Schiller based his poem "The Ring of Polykrates" on Herodotus.

<ul><li> The obscure fantasy game <em>Dragon Warriors</em> featured Vallandar's swords in the first adventure. Vallandar was the universe's King Arthur-equivalent who would return to his kingdom at the end of the world, and anyone who took one of the swords (they were just standing there) would have it with them forever so that they could join him. Bury it in the woods, drop it in an ocean, and a few days later it would return to your inventory. These were good swords though, and would even become magical if the player played his cards right.
</li><li> Many cursed items in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> do this:
<ul><li> <em>The Loadstone:</em> Weighs down the user, decreasing his base speed, and appears in one's possession even if destroyed.
</li><li> <em>The Talisman of Zagy:</em> When used wrong, it acts like a loadstone. But in a subversion, not only CAN you destroy it, but it turns into a diamond if you hold onto it for a few months.
</li><li> Many cursed weapons (e.g., the ever-popular <em>sword -1</em>) will appear in your hand every time you enter combat, forcing you to use a sub-par weapon. Players quickly found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">clever uses</a> for this item. After all, you can never be disarmed and never have to carry a weapon when you're "cursed" with the sword. Fighting with a -1 weapon is far better than fighting with no weapon.
</li><li> Unless it's a <em>cursed berserking weapon</em>, which in a fight will force the wielder to attack <em>everyone</em> in sight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoSurvivors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoSurvivors">even their own allies</a>) until they're dead, incapacitated, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone">the only one left alive</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Ironically, those types of weapons often have magical bonuses</a>.
</li><li> A more benign version are the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/magic/legendaryWeapons.htm">Legendary Weapons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from 3.5th Edition. Once a character has started to take levels in the Scion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> for such a weapon, it can't be separated from its owner for very long, as fate literally will find a way to reunite them. Adding to the fact those weapons are quite hard to destroy, it insures the character will hardly ever be disarmed.
</li></ul></li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> module, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> are ordered to dispose of a trash bag full of treasonous Communist propaganda pamphlets, which prove to be indestructible (and if they just ditch it somewhere, then someone ends up finding it and returning it to them). Eventually, they get the pamphlets superglued all over themselves (though this does at least let them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">survive a massive weapon blast</a> just before the final confrontation).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, a Lucky Rock is an otherwise ordinary stone that always reappears in its owner's possession. Simple (but expensive) magic can transfer this quality to javelins, arrows, and other tools of war. The effect is not immediate, so a "lucky arrow" is not a bottomless quiver in and of itself, but the enchantment has obvious utility regardless.

Even if you've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">time travelled</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot">shrunk yourself and entered your own brain</a>.

</li><li> A recurring hazard of many fantasy roleplaying games (both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">pencil-and-paper</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">computer/console</a>) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">cursed magic items</a> which not only carry some in-game penalty but which force the cursed character to continue using them until the curse is magically removed.
<ul><li> Cursed items in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> and most roguelikes will <em>weld themselves to your hand</em> — if you have the misfortune of trying to use a two-handed cursed sword or a cursed sword and a cursed shield you'll be unable to cast spells or use most of your inventory because both your hands are attached to a chunk of metal. There's also items like Nethack's loadstone, which begins doing this the moment you pick it up — it cannot be removed from your backpack in any way until its curse has been lifted and weighs more than most full suits of body armor, and more than the <em>entire</em> weight that some weak characters can carry without being slowed down by the load. And heaven forbid you make the mistake of wearing a cursed blindfold... though the worst is probably putting on an amulet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">that turns out to be a cursed Amulet of Strangulation</a>.
</li><li> There's a few of such undroppable cursed items in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder">Eye of the Beholder</a> II: The Legend of Darkmoon</em>. However, getting rid of them just require one <em>Remove Curse</em> spell, which is accessible to both mages and clerics. So it's only a problem if your characters are too low level to cast it (or can't rest and regain spells, but then you have a much bigger problem on your hands).
</li><li> Cursed artifacts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> cling to the wielder (like a toothy ring) once they equip them and can only be removed via a cleansing spell. In their defense, they usually offer good buffs so you will only want to get rid of them if you find a something even better for the respective slot. This was true for most cursed weapons and equipment in Infinity Engine games. The difference about it in <em>Torment</em> was that relatively few of the "cursed" items had a downside other than it being impossible to remove them. The true Clingy MacGuffin of the game, however, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Moridor's Box</a>, a quest item that can't be removed unless you give it away, open it, or leave a specific area without completing the quest.
</li><li> Some of the medium-high bracket of weapons and armour in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> are cursed, which means when you put them on you cannot take them off again unless you go to the games' resident healers and pay through the nose for what can only be described as "curse solvent". Also cursed weapons have a habit of paralysing you for a turn in battle.
<ul><li> <em>Medium</em>-high for the second game, at least, but the cursed items in the first game were the strongest you'd get, or at least, strong enough that you'd want one of your characters to use them (along with the Cleric's Ring, which nullified every part of the curse except the inability to take them off.) The only reason not to have them is that it prevents you from "fixing" the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">item drops</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Same goes for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> games. Once you equip a cursed item, you cannot remove it unless you go to a healer. It may appear to be a high-end weapon, but only give a lousy change in stats.
<ul><li> One notable exception is the Sword of Destruction in the second game: it is far and away the strongest weapon in the game, with a boosted critical hit rate as well, but it prevents you from attacking roughly 1/3rd of the time. As long as you're okay with that, it can be extremely effective.
</li></ul></li><li> Cursed items have functioned like this in Camelot's games since even its earliest RPG, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningInTheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningInTheDarkness">Shining in the Darkness</a></em>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries">Shining Series</a></em> in general as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The Keyblade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> is a benign example of this trope. In fact, its inability to leave its user was used as a plot device, as Sora gave it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Captain Jack Sparrow</a> as payment — and it naturally reappeared in Sora's hand later. Said inability is also used for one of the attacks in series; who needs a boomerang when a thrown weapon will unerringly reappear in the wielder's hand, no matter how many times he throws it at an enemy? It's used in a similar way when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roxas tries to disarm Sora by pinning one of his own keyblades into the ground in the handle. It returns Sora's hand, Roxas gets confused, and Sora deals a fatal blow.</span>
<ul><li> It can however be passed to another worthy wielder so long as the original doesn't object and call it back to them. Sora and Riku repeatedly wind up holding each others Keyblades during the Xemnas battle. Also if a keyblader is in self doubt ala Sora thinking he wasn't really accomplishing anything, then another keyblader with stronger convictions can actually steal it until they get out of their funk. Sora, Riku and Roxas have stolen Keyblades from each other and stolen them back throughout their various battles when one of their heroic resolves wavered. Lack of confidence can even lead to the wielder being unable to call the keyblade at all, though Xion can still use Roxas' own effectively when he lends it to her.
</li><li> In the <em>Days</em> manga Roxas throws his keyblade out the window in a fit of anger and it come right back to him.
</li><li> Despite all of the benefits and quirks listed above, the Keyblade's clinginess is actually somewhat of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>. For all of the power it gives, it also acts as a permanent homing beacon for the forces of darkness, meaning every user will be unrelentingly attacked by Heartless, Nobodies, etc. for as long as the Realm of Darkness remains connected to the Realm of Light (which is, luckily, usually not the case). While this is really just a framing device to give a reason for Heartless to keep popping up in the games' combat areas, it's really a nightmare when you think about it; they <em>never</em> get a day off (unless somebody takes the dangerous journey to disconnect the Realms).
</li></ul></li><li> Anything designated as a "plot item" in all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> is undroppable and unsellable and un-give-to-party-members-able.

While the hosts can exercise varying degrees of control over their Runes, it's almost impossible to get rid of them. The Runes chose their own hosts, and also choose when (or if) they leave. Typically that only happens when the host dies, which could take awhile because immortality is one of the side effects. If the host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">would prefer to live a normal life</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">die eventually</a>, but doesn't want to die <em>now</em>...that's just too bad. There are very few methods of removing a True Rune against its will, and they either result in either a drastically reduced lifespan (as in, death within a matter of <em>days</em>) or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>, both of which can only be averted by taking the Rune back. And sometimes not even death is enough for the host to escape; at least two of the Runes are confirmed to have absorbed the souls of their prior hosts. Also, while it's uncertain what their agendas are (or even if they have agendas that would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">comprehensible to humans</a> at all), what's very clear is that they very much <em>want their power to be used</em>. And they have some degree of control over fate, so they can push their hosts into situations where they're all but forced to cut loose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery">Ancient Domains of Mystery</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> with ordinary cursed items (that is, ones that have the "cursed" status): once equipped, they can't be unequipped because you can't bring yourself to do it, even if the item is somehow killing you. Remove the cursed status, though, or somehow get the item destroyed, and the problem is solved. "Trapped" armour is a step further because it can only be removed by destroying it.
</li><li> The self-replicating, seemingly useless artifact known as the "si" can cause major problems if a player tries running the Infinite Dungeon while carrying it. Extra sis can't be ditched inside the Infinite Dungeon, and the artifact will copy itself, over and over, until the player finds himself crushed under the weight of hundreds of them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has a minor variant of this to keep players on their toes — sometimes a Strange Old Man will pop up near your character, give you a puzzle box, and disappear. This box can be solved for a small reward, but cannot be dropped or banked. What's more, if you don't solve it quickly the box doubles itself, taking up more inventory space until there is none left. Each box then has to be solved individually to make it go away, but you only get a reward after the last one is solved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series' in general plays this straight on a meta-level starting with <em>Oblivion</em> having "Quest Items". These items are flagged as essential and cannot be dropped until the associated quest is completed. Unfortunately, quite a few of them are bugged so that they remain undroppable even after the quest is completed, leaving you stuck with these items as eternal inventory clutter. Popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">mods</a> for both <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Skyrim</em> removes the quest item tag altogether, which means being careful not to lose the items, just like the earlier games in the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>, the Staff of the Everscamp is an in-universe example. Cursed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Sheogorath</a>, the staff cannot be discarded by the owner. When the quest giver acquired the Staff, she tried to cast a spell with it but ended up causing a whole bunch of non-hostile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Scamps</a> to appear and start following her around. She couldn't bring herself to get rid of the staff due to the enchantment, but her friend learns that if someone willingly takes the staff from her, then the curse would transfer to them. That's where you come in... (Don't worry, the end of the quest is you finding a way to permanently get rid of it.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> has an in-universe example with Hircine's Ring. Sinding, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolf</a>, had stolen a ring of Hircine's in the hopes that it could help him control his transformations. However, Hircine, angered by this, cursed the ring such that it made Sinding's transformations even less predictable, and also bonding it to him unless he can find one willing to take the ring from him. The player character finds him in the jail of Falkreath town, and, if they take the ring from him, it becomes permanently equipped to them unless they can appease Hircine with a ritualistic hunt, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">culminating in the player either killing Sinding or the hunters that now pursue him. Sparing Sinding results in the ring's curse being lifted, and can be equipped by the player anytime to transform into a werewolf multiple times day</span>. Before being lifted, the curse of the ring also affects the player. If they are not introduced to lycanthropy beforehand<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bqnu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2bqnu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bqnu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ergo, have advanced enough into the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Companions'</span> questline enough to become werewolves themselves.</span> then all it does is to hog your ring slot for no effect whatsoever. If they <em>are</em>, then they get a rather high chance to transform into a werewolf against their will, multiple times a day instead of the customary once-every-sunrise. And it happens even more frequently when neutral or friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> are around, who'll instantly want you dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda-era</a> <em>Fallout</em> games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>) inherit their <em>Elder Scrolls</em> sister series' idea of Quest Items. And just like the <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, there are several mods available for each which remove the "quest item" tag so that the items can be discarded.
</li><li> The series' iconic Pip-Boy 3000 is also a canon form of this. This wrist-mounted computer is nigh-indestructible and can't be separated from its host (voluntarily or involuntarily in most cases). This is taken to ridiculous extremes at times: the Brotherhood outcast sawed a vault dweller's arm off to try to get his Pip-Boy, but the device wouldn't work afterwards. This is a little inconsistent, however—at least three games in the series (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, <em>New Vegas</em>, and <em>Fallout 4</em>) start with your character receiving a Pip-Boy which explicitly belonged to someone else. In <em>Fallout 3</em>, it is inconsistent within the game itself as well. The very same Pip-Boy 3000 that your player character received at their 10-year birthday was refurbished from some undisclosed origin (either a previous owner or a cargo crate, hinted to be the former), which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">bombed point blank!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole">And you thought the technician who gave you it was exaggerating...</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> has several variations.
<ul><li> In <em>MM3</em> the quest items appeared normally in the inventory but could not be dropped or sold.
</li><li> In <em>MM4-5</em> they never show up in the regular inventory, but had their own section and could not be manipulated in any way. MM6-8 followed the traditional version of this trope, where after dropping a quest item somewhere and then going to talk to the Oracle the item would reappear in the party's hands.
</li><li> <em>Clash of Heroes</em> brings us the Blade of Binding, which fuses with the users arm.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfVermilion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfVermilion">Sword of Vermilion</a></em> has the cursed Dark and Death Swords. If you equip either one, you won't be able to unequip it or cast any spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a></em> has the Dark One Sign. A Zigzagged example in that, on one hand, you can use it to unlock the door to the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCathedral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCathedral">Creepy Cathedral</a>, temporarily removing it from your inventory until you leave said cathedral. On the other hand, if you try to put it in your storage chest...
<div class="indent"><em>You realize with horror that you are totally unable to put down the Dark One Sign here. It seems to have a will of its own.</em>
</div></li><li> The Pyrite Parrot of Petaluma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland">Tales of Monkey Island</a></em>, which survives being molten and keeps coming back to Guybrush Threepwood.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em>, collecting the Stop N Swop items will cause them to stay in your inventory forever. You cannot get rid of them, even if you delete your save file. You can, however, get rid of them if you are playing the XBLA version of the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheClueFinders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheClueFinders">The ClueFinders</a> 4th Grade Adventures</em>, Joni gets an ancient Egyptian ring stuck on her finger, which doesn't come off until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bad guy's goons use a magic spell to attract it</span>. Said ring turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the key to releasing Set</span>.
</li><li> The demon summoning app from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em>. Applying for the death site Nicea leads to the user eventually getting accosted by demons, and defeating them adds the app onto the person's phone. The app cannot be deleted, as Daichi unsuccessfully tries when he first sees it. Though given that having successfully managed to form a contract with a demon is an <em>essential</em> thing to have a fighting chance in the dying world, one doesn't want to delete it.
<ul><li> The same happens with the Metaverse app in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>. The player can delete the strange app that appeared on their phone but it always comes back, likely because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yaldabaoth put it there and wants them to use it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The dead fish in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a> 6</em>. It's confiscated twice from you. First, when you're captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a>. When you teleport away, one of them throws it back to you ("Here's your fish!"). The second time is when you are capture by the security personnel on the <em>DeepShip 86</em>. When you escape on a stolen shuttlecraft, a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Imperial stormtroopers</a> show up, one of which throws the fish into the shuttle's engine with the same words. Subverted in that the fish turns out to be quite useful in the end.
</li><li> Link and Zelda are stated to have had parts of the triforce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasWithYouAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasWithYouAllAlong">with them all along</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, this forces Zelda to disguise herself as Sheik to stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> from getting it, implying that there's no way to just remove it and hide it somewhere. In Link's case, this is implied to be the reason he's the one who has to go on the quest to save the world.
<ul><li> The Master Sword is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>. Unlike all other weapons, it can't be dropped, thrown or broken, with it merely 'resting' until it recharges if it's used too much. It's also likely this in most other games in the series (since outside of the final battle in Ocarina of Time Link never drops it or has it taken away from him), though the fact <em>every</em> item he ever picks up is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">Clingy MacGuffin</a> with a few odd exceptions means it's hard to be sure.

It may or may not be intelligent, but it can almost certainly teleport.
</li><li> Kurt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnlimitedSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnlimitedSaga">Unlimited Saga</a></em> has a cursed gaunlet which he can't take off. If you play as him, Kurt will be forced to fight one-on-one with a monster from time to time.
</li><li> The first game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpellcastingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpellcastingSeries">The Spellcasting Series</a></em> contains a book so good, you can't put it down. Literally. The only way to get rid of it is to give it to someone else, who then suffers the same problem. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doing this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in the penultimate puzzle thwarts his evil scheme, as he needs two free hands to activate the Sorcerer's Appliance.</span>
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfKyrandia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfKyrandia">The Legend of Kyrandia</a></em> game, it is played for laughs with Zanthia's mixing stick. After the Hand steals it and is forced to return, it appears in Act 2 stuck in the fountain, and then serves Zanthia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">many various purposes</a>. Even with Zanthia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a> tendencies, the Stick keeps appearing wherever Zanthia goes, from Moon Harbor and up to the Wheels of Destiny, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after it is used as a lever to lodge the missing gear back in place, it finally meets its demise and breaks in half</span>.

Worse, if you restore your game to a moment before you picked it up, you'll realize that you <em>still have it</em>!
</li><li> Ratatosk's Core does this to Marta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnoftheNewworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnoftheNewworld">Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</a></em>. The only way to remove it is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> for her to die.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> and its sequel, quest items cannot be sold, broken down, or given to a container (the exception being when your entire inventory is removed, such as on the <em>Leviathan</em> in I or Citadel Station in II). This is a harmless example: at worst,<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> you need exactly <em>once</em> (the Telos shuttle launch codes, the Khoonda master card key, datapads)remain on your person for the remainder of the game. There are two other notable exceptions, however:
<ul><li> In I, all quest items from Taris are removed from the inventory when you land on Dantooine.
</li><li> In cut content for II, the Sonic Imprint Sensor turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how the HK-50s are tracking you.

He is literally <em>not allowed to move</em> until he picks it back up again. It really underscores that all of the humans in the game are being manipulated by forces outside of their control, with the Tome as the conduit.

They bury it again, this time under a statue of the Virgin Mary, with a bunch of garlic. It returns again.

Fortunately, Nelson had the foresight to buy a lottery ticket with all 1s, and won $1,111.

Furthermore, once the sword has bonded to an owner, only that individual may use it, and the only way to give it up is to die (at which point it returns to its resting place in the Temple of Chaos). Yuta claims that the standard rules don't apply to him; he could draw the sword, use it, then hand it off to someone else. It's not clear if this is because he's half-Chaos Clan (magic doesn't work on them quite the way it should) or if it's because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his mother is the goddess Kali, who made the sword in the first place</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters">Trollhunters</a></em>, the Amulet of Merlin is extremely difficult to separate from its titular Trollhunter. If the Trollhunter tries to get rid of it, it will simply teleport back to them and while this doesn't work if the amulet is instead stolen, the Trollhunter can still exert enough will over the amulet to make it fly back to them from wherever it is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, the Hearts of the World function as this as they can only be given away willingly and any attempts to steal them means they return to their original users. Nerissa uses this to her advantage throughout the second season.

<ul><li> This can happen to people who wear the same ring for too long, such as a wedding band. Over time, a person's fingers can develop around the ring to the point where it becomes stuck and can't be removed without filing it off. It's common enough that specialist tools exist just for removing such rings.

</li><li> Credit history, criminal records, educational records, and a myriad of other records collected by the government and private industry tend to follow, and potentially haunt, a person until they die. Or longer.
