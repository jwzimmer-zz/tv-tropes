This is the basic idea behind <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics">an entire discipline of linguistics.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It means that a thousand years' difference (for example, between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfEnglish">Old English and modern English</a>) can make two versions of the same language completely unintelligible; another thousand (as with the 2,000 years dividing Latin and modern French) and you might not even realize they're related.
</p><p>In real life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">a character traveling into the distant future</a> would literally have to learn <a class="urllink" href="http://jbr.me.uk/futurese.html">a completely new language:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> even if people are still using spoken language rather than, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicTelepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicTelepathy">Electronic Telepathy</a> and even if they are speaking what they call "English", there's a fairly high probability that it won't be similar enough to the character's English to allow intelligibility.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sme1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0sme1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sme1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> While all languages change, they do so at different rates: English is highly mutable while, for example, Icelandic is quite stable — and even its pronunciation is quite divergent from Old Norse. It has been stipulated that this is directly relevant to the magnitude of societal and cultural change, and that a global communication network that persists for many centuries would prevent English from changing much, for reasons of compatibility with older but commonly available and accessed historical data. Additionally, the writing and speech of a particular language don't change at the same rates: for instance, while modern English speakers can read Chaucer with some difficulty, if they were transported back to the 1300s they'd probably perceive the English spoken as a foreign language, since the pronunciation of words has changed drastically while the spelling has remained somewhat fixed since the invention of the printing press.</span> In fiction, however, linguistic drift is almost universally ignored. For writers, it's a lot of trouble to translate into an ancient or imaginary language, and audiences often prefer to watch a show in their native language. Therefore, people hailing from vastly different time periods will almost always speak the language of the audience, and rarely with so much as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAStupidAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAStupidAccent">Just a Stupid Accent</a> (though characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a> or thereabouts typically speak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeOldeButcheredeEnglishe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeOldeButcheredeEnglishe">Ye Olde Butcherede Englishe</a>).

Others will try to attribute this trope to the advent of recording technology. This may or may not turn out to be the case: after all, we are discussing tropes and memes on a wiki hosted on the web. Someone from the year 2000 wouldn't understand some of that sentence, while someone from 1990 would understand almost <em>none</em> of it (hell, a good number of people <em>today</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary">still wouldn't understand it</a>). On the other hand, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> would be unable to understand the sentence "His car's on the blink—the distributor is busted", the very concept of "car" being alien to him, it's entirely possible to read his works with a dictionary at most for troublesome words, and were we to pop into 1600 and chat with him about the weather, we'd have trouble with each other's accents and a few changed grammatical features, but no worse than, say, an American Southerner on first meeting a Yorkshireman.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, Servants are summoned from the distant past and seem to have no problem conversing fluently in modern (even accentless, in the anime) Japanese. No matter where a Servant comes from, and no matter when they were alive, the summoning spell gives them basic knowledge of the world at the time of their summoning, including a familiarity with the average level of technology and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes">a decent grasp of any languages they would be likely to use</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kagome falls into around the year 1550 and has no trouble understanding <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Late_Middle_Japanese">Late Middle Japanese.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Inuyasha has managed to come to the present without any trouble either.
</li><li> The English translation has the elderly Kaede use the archaic thou and thy, hinting at the language changes. For some reason though, the characters who are even older than Kaede (including her sister Kikyo who gets revived in undead form, and most of the villains of the story) <em>don't</em> speak in a similarly archaic manner. 1550 is only five decades away from the start of Modern Japanese, so it's understandable that Kagome wouldn't have too much trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> There is an "Outer World" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> that has been blocked off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">a magical barrier</a> courtesy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Monster Race</a> for at little over a millennium, hence two different cultures: the "Inner World" (i.e the main setting of the series) thrives on magic, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> put out that everyone in it speaks the same language. The "Outer World" has little access to magic and thrives on technology instead, and has peoples in various types of environments, including a scant amount of primitive tribes. The third season of the anime has the main party go to the Outer World, but unless one member of the group has a translator on them, it would be unlikely that the Outer Worlders would speak the same language (whatever the heck it is) as they do. This problem doesn't arise in the novels because Lina and Gourry stay in the Inner World for the entire time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, despite taking place thousands of years in the distant future, still has Earth-bound humans (and possibly the Moonrace) using modern English. Though this <em>might</em> be handwaved by the fact that much of the series takes place in what used to be United States.
</li><li> Apparently, contemporary English has become the <em>lingua franca</em> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedSpaceOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedSpaceOfAmerica">Free Planets Alliance</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a>.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played straight in the anime, where Martine speaks English while the Abh speak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Baronh</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">represented by Japanese</a> sprinkled with Baronh terms).
</li><li> The novels zigzag on the issue. Martinese is descended from English but when trying to communicate in English with a young Jinto he can't understand it. It's unclear if that means that English is still being used somewhere or if at least some people know it but its no longer a living language like Latin in the modern world.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LupinIIITheItalianAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LupinIIITheItalianAdventure">Lupin III: The Italian Adventure</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leonardo Da Vinci</span> can fluently speak modern Italian in spite of originally being from Firenze in an era <em>before Italian language even existed</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> by Italian language having pretty much been ripped off from Firenze's dialect in the 19th century (see below), thus being close enough to what <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leonardo</span> spoke his genius could quickly adapt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone">Dr. Stone</a></em>, the inhabitants of Ishigami village <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are descended from six astronauts who survived the stone apocalypse 3000 years prior.</span> Despite this 3000 year gap, the protagonists (who were asleep during that time) can converse with them with no trouble at all. Granted, in a weekly publication as competitive as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a>, the author probably doesn't have the luxury of inventing and explaining a whole new language.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: For some unknown reason, everyone speaks the same language (heard in Japanese) regardless of nationality or era. This is almost never discussed in the franchise. May have something to do with alternate history involving supernatural precursors.

There was no indication that Rahne had learned Middle English or indeed Scots Gaelic (should Robert have even spoken the latter; it had already become a minority language by the Bruce's era). Or Modern Lowland Scots, which is actually closer to Middle English than to modern English, but Lowland Scots is a nearly dead language, even less likely to Rahne to know anything about. Especially since she's a Highland Scot.

</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timeline">Timeline</a></em> has this, with medieval French and English soldiers speaking the early 21st century version of their languages perfectly so that the English troops have no problems communicating with the modern-day heroes. This was handwaved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes">Translator Microbes</a> in the book, which made a specific plot point of the fact that the medieval people spoke contemporary dialects of those languages (as well as Occitan and Latin), and having the time travelers struggle to be understood by them (because they naturally lacked the hidden earpiece translators the time travelers wore).

It is a dead language taught to some people akin to Latin. Teachers and well-educated people are the only ones who know it.
</li><li> The English language in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Idiocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Idiocracy">Idiocracy</a></em> has degenerated into a combination of Ebonics, Redneck, Valley Girl and Hispanic gang banger by the 25th century.

<ul><li> In <em>3001</em>, sound recording technology is said to have stabilized all languages. As a result, they have changed about as much as is appropriate for two or three hundred years, instead of the thousand that have actually elapsed.
<ul><li> Although there are also many new words and terms in the language (which is referred to as Anglish), mostly from scientific and technological advancement. The protagonist (from a thousand years earlier) also has some difficulty getting the voice-activated technology to understand his accent.
</li><li> It is implied that there may be bigger differences in the language, but the people interacting with the main protagonist have had the early 21st century English uploaded into their brains for his comfort. They make the occasional unsettling mistake, like saying "KO" instead of "OK".
</li></ul></li><li> Clarke relied on the same justification in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSongsOfDistantEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSongsOfDistantEarth">The Songs of Distant Earth</a></em>.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CommonwealthSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CommonwealthSaga">Commonwealth Saga/Void Trilogy</a>, regeneration allows essentially eternal life - so the centuries old aristocracy maintains the general vernacular.
</li><li> Addressed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoFrankowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoFrankowski">Leo Frankowski</a>'s <em>Conrad Stargard</em> series. When Conrad goes back in time to 13th-century Poland, he realizes how lucky he is to be there, where the language hasn't drifted very much in 700 years, as opposed to England, where he would be completely incomprehensible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Which is just as much of a bull as you might expect</a>.
<ul><li> Frankowski tends to forget that the characters are supposed to be speaking Polish and not English so to a Polish person reading the books in English some of the conversations make no sense since they use English puns or language conventions. Some of them being also anachronistic.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a>, grammar came about thanks to Chaucer:
<div class="indent"> We did not always have grammar. In medieval England, people said whatever they wanted, without regard to rules, and as a result they sounded like morons. Take the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, who couldn't even spell his first name right. He wrote a large poem called "Canterbury Tales," in which people from various professions - knight, monk, miller, reever, riveter, eeler, diver, stevedore, spinnaker, etc. - drone on and on like this:
</div><div class="indent"> In a somer sesun whon softe was the sunne <br/>I kylled a younge birde ande I ate it on a bunne.
</div><div class="indent"> When Chaucer's poem was published everybody read it and said: "My God we need some grammar around here."
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Digitesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Digitesque">Digitesque</a></em>: Averted. Even the Institute, the most advanced post-Fall organization that has made special effort to keep old language alive, has experienced quite a lot of linguistic drift. Ada is, with a great deal of difficulty, able to piece together English using a subtitled video with a voiceover and pictures.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinotopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinotopia">Dinotopia</a></em> book, the protagonists have trouble communicating with everyone else on the island because they were the first newcomers to land there in some while. They meet a native girl who uses "a language in which I seemed occasionally to hear a familiar word," and when one protagonist tries speaking to her in English, French, and German she seems to catch a few words but is just as mystified. A local polyglot figures out what the protagonists speak in - "<em>Ank- ayyank-leesh. Yank-ank-kee.</em>" - and a man is produced who is "fifteen mothers English", aka fifteen generations removed from English ancestors, and knows an archaic form of the language, to translate for them and help them learn the dialect, which is a blend of many.
<ul><li> Other works in the setting (except perhaps the 1995 computer game that no one remembers) which feature new arrivals washing ashore play it utterly straight, with said arrivals showing up speaking the same language as the locals.
</li></ul></li><li> Outside of two demonic exceptions, every character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> speaks medieval Italian, the native language of the author and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>. Sure, there are a lot of Italians in the <em>Comedy</em>, but there are also conversations with Roman contemporaries of Jesus who wrote poetry in Latin who predated Dante's dialect by a thousand years and most notably, a conversation with Adam about the fact that language changes over time!
</li><li> In the Czech sci-fantasy book <em>Divocí a zlí</em> (<em>Wild and Dangerous</em>), the protagonist (who in the backstory comes from a post-apocalyptic future, and yet understands modern Czech) ends up helping Alfred the Great fight off some Danes and Swedes. And has no problem understanding and communicating with the locals. To put into perspective, Beowulf was written somewhere around that time.
</li><li> Played completely straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em>. Despite taking place 2,500 years after Pern was colonized, rhymes and puns still work in English, the entire planet speaks one homogenous language and ancient documents from the original colonization of the planet are completely readable by the modern characters. Additionally, a trip back in time several hundred years reveals no linguistic difficulties whatsoever. However, it is noted in later books that both the dolphins and AIVAS have trouble understanding/being understood. Also, Robinton is distressed to discover the language has altered at all, saying that it's the job of the Harpers to make sure the language doesn't change. Oddly, he and other characters assume that the dolphin's grasp of the language is closer to the old form even before checking with AIVAS.
</li><li> Used to a ludicrous extent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFadedSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFadedSun">The Faded Sun</a></em> trilogy, where the high tongue (formal language) of the Mri is show to have been completely stable between two isolated groups of Mri for approximately a million years.
</li><li> Addressed in David Severn's 'The Future Took Us' in which the protagonists only gradually realise the locals are speaking a futuristic version of English. "Bread" has become "brade" and "man", "mun".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatShip">Great Ship</a></em> universe, English appears to have died out, but whatever has replaced it seems to be very static, courtesy of pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyOfImmortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyOfImmortals">every speaker being effectively immortal</a>. The only language drift would be caused by isolation due to all forms of travel and communication being slower-than-light. One exception is in the novel <em>The Memory of Sky</em>, set on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colony</a> of mortals. When they discover a hatch on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollowWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollowWorld">Hollow World</a> with unknown text, they have to go to their oldest writings to decipher it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out that their entire world is a penal colony and the <em>other</em> bit of undecipherable text they discover is the world's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">purge button</a></span>.
</li><li> In the short story "Gun for Hire" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MackReynolds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MackReynolds">Mack Reynolds</a>, a hitman is brought from the past to a future utopia. He's really not inclined to help, but is told that just running for it will do no good as only students of dead languages can speak American English these days.
</li><li> Played ridiculously straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>, where everyone speaks Standard English, unless they happen to represent a specific culture/country in real-world Earth. In which case they'll supposedly speak that language and dabble it into their Standard English that they otherwise speak all the time. It's stated that sound recordings have slowed linguistic change to a crawl. Enough that Honor has no problems reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">C.S. Forester's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> and the only problem she has is in dealing with the archaic units of measurement.
<ul><li> In some places it is clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a>: The Republic of Haven speaks French, the Andermanni speak a bastard German-Chinese language, San Martin spoke Spanish until the Republic of Haven came in. Most language issues are handwaved due to good translation software.
</li><li> In another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a> book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheApocalypseTroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheApocalypseTroll">The Apocalypse Troll</a></em>, a character from 400 years in the future is stranded on modern Earth. It's stated that the advent of widespread sound recording pretty much stabilized the language, but she still has a tendency to slip into incomprehensible future slang (generally leaving out syllables in confusing places: "Mister" becomes "Ster", for example).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a>, it's explicitly mentioned that the spoken language of Safehold has drifted in 800 years and the protagonist has to learn the new pronunciations before venturing out. The written language has apparently remained stable though.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> wrote a surprisingly funny, informative, and accurate essay called "Language for Time Travelers", where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> for the information is the travails of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">time traveler</a> having to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">vowel shifts, abbreviation, and slang</a> in the future. It's worth tracking down, and you may learn something.
</li><li> Played straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenMacLeod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenMacLeod">Ken MacLeod</a>'s <em>Learning The World</em>. The book takes place 14,000 years in the future, by which time it seems virtually certain that English will have changed drastically, in the unlikely event that anything that could be called English still exists at all. Despite this, an important plot point hinges on the fact that the word "bug" could mean either "insect" or "spying device".
<ul><li> Many other languages do use words that mean "small creepy-crawly animal, possibly parasitic" in idioms for concepts like "curse", "nuisance", and "tag-along", so it's entirely possible whatever they speak has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyPreciseTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyPreciseTranslation">Conveniently Precise Translation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> was a professor of linguistics and fully aware how unrealistic this trope is, but he used it anyway with the (roughly) 500-year-old Gollum in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. Actually, the 500 year age might be dealing with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> attempt to avert it. The <em>appendices</em> are the ones making Gollum 500. In fact, they <em>specifically</em> mention events which make it possible for him to be 500 - like the Hobbits temporarily returning to Anduin around that time while Sauron was banished, but the book itself seems to imply he's closer to 2000 - and the Silmarillion states explicitly he's a thousand at least (the Ring was stated to be found while Gondor still had kings).
<ul><li> It is also explicitly mentioned at some point that the text of the Rings books have been *intentionally* rendered as Modern English, even though the different ages and regions would have had different dialects and (to an extent) vocabulary. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Apparently, this is done to make it easier for a modern reader to understand.</a> The Orcs in particular are said to be using a "degraded" dialect that the narration flatly refuses to render accurately.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with Eternal Russian in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoonUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoonUniverse">Noon Universe</a> novels by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StrugatskyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StrugatskyBrothers">Strugatsky Brothers</a> with the crew of an experimental FTL starship that accidentally traveled to the next century. Nobody ever mentions any linguistic problems. Considering that the story focuses on the awe-inspiring (or just cool) technological advances, which tend to shock even contemporaries, minor linguistic problems are likely to be overshadowed.
<ul><li> The same happens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MondayBeginsOnSaturday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MondayBeginsOnSaturday">Monday Begins on Saturday</a></em> where an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">Antimatter-powered</a> relativistic starship leaves Earth in mid-21st century and returns several thousand years later. Similarly, the girlfriends of some of the astronauts opted to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicles</a> and are thawed out around the same time.

Also there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">Aliens Speaking English</a> (in another galaxy, no less). This is because the segment is a hilarious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">mocking</a> of overused futuristic SF tropes. If you squint hard enough, you can even recognize the originals.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReturnFromTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReturnFromTheStars">Return from the Stars</a></em> mostly plays this straight, though after 127 years there's some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureSlang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureSlang">Future Slang</a>, and there are scrolling ads (?) displaying confusing words that sound vaguely like corporate trademarks.

Quite reasonable — except we are talking about 2000 <em>centuries</em> in the future.
</li><li> Played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce">Spaceforce</a></em> universe, where Earth is at the centre of one of the three galactic superpowers and everyone in that Union speaks, or at least knows, a language that's stated to be English. Apart from a few buzzwords, it's identical to the English of today.
</li><li> A particularly bad case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em>. The High D'Haran (their Latin) has many dialects from different times, despite being mainly a scholars' language. However, the New World and the Old World have the exact same <em>common</em> language despite being separated for <em>3,000</em> years.
</li><li> Beautiful subversion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S.

The project leader interrogates Merlin for hours in impeccable medieval Latin, only to get no response. They then try communicating in Gaelic, Welsh, Old English, and start running through the list of <em>any</em> ancient languages that Merlin might have spoken. Merlin continues to fail to respond, leading them to the conclusion that he's purposely stonewalling them. While they go off to confer as to how to negotiate with him, our protagonist sneaks in and randomly greets Merlin in normal modern English, and, of course, Merlin begins a friendly chat with him. It transpires that the <em>real</em> Merlin actually woke up and fled the scene hours ago, and the man they've got is just a random homeless guy who wandered into the site and thinks everyone around him is insane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline">Timeline</a></em> (referenced in the film section above) had a scholar who had studied the period French extensively and was the only one who could really communicate, and even then he had a great deal of difficulty.

All four differ significantly from their galactic versions, yet remain intercomprehensible with them.
</li><li> Cordelia at one point finds a book of poetry written in English but using the Cyrillic alphabet.
</li><li> Possibly the difference is more in pronunciation than anything else. At another point Elli finds it unnerving when Miles switches between guttural Barrayaran accent and "musical" Betan.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was that the language itself didn't change in Randland that time because White Tower had stayed a (mostly) continuous institution and exerted its influence all over. The Seanchan kept the language fairly constant because of the ruling powers tightly controlled education to exert power. It's mentioned a few times in the book that people of Randland find the Seanchan accent to be virtually unintelligible until they're used to it.

<ul><li> A character from 25,000 years in the future even speaks <em>with a recognizable Australian twang</em>, although said character is an AI and could conceivably have downloaded an ancient language database.

In human terms, the Clans have only been around for 100 years at oldest. However, to cats, the four Clans have been around for dozens, if not hundreds, of generations. Still, the cats in the origin series speak exactly the same as the cats at the tail end of the series' timeline.

Kip. a modern (well, 1950s) boy, meets a Roman centurion from the later Empire. Kip speaks high school classical Latin, while the soldier, who is stationed in Spain, speaks a rough-and-ready lingo, with lots of what-will-be-Spanish thrown in. Luckily, Kip also speaks Spanish, so they can work out a fairly understandable mix. </li></ul></div>

<ul><li> SG-1 began with people on other planets speaking different languages, mostly based on old Earth cultures. By the second episode they realized it wouldn't work with only one main character (Jackson) able to speak to the people, so it was changed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> Will mentions this as evidence of why three woman claiming to have awoken from hundreds of years of sleep have to be delusional - they all speak perfect English. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As it turns out they simply used their tremendous psychic powers to learn modern English instantly.</span> In the first episodes Helen and John's mode of speech is a clue as to their shared origin. Their English is perfectly comprehensible, but slightly archaic and formalized. They and Tesla have all exhibited some distaste for modern conventions of the language.
<ul><li> Good luck picking up on the fact that Tesla is Serbian, given his near-total lack of an appropriate accent even in flashbacks. The only time this is ever mentioned is when the British government requests they stop <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adam</span> and do it for their country, prompting Tesla to mention that he's not British.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, the official language of the Earth Alliance is English. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a> is in effect, but it doesn't explain how the characters can get away with verbatim quotes of Abraham Lincoln (or, in Garibaldi's case, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoons).
<ul><li> In one episode there is a delusional man claiming to be King Arthur, they figure out that he isn't who he claims to be because he speaks modern English. Seems strange, as earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a> was portrayed with just a British accent, but between the series being set in the 23rd century (2258-2263), thus with relatively little drift, and King Arthur's first language <em>not</em> being English (as Old English was the language of his main enemies, Arthur's would have been either a variant of 5th/6th century Latin or Common Brittonic), is perfectly justified.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em> episodes involving human incursions, a 14th Century knight strays into modern London and speaks perfectly clear Essex English, as does the local back in his time whom the ARC scout questions. Despite the fact that what passed for English back then was actually closer to modern Dutch. Even the fact that the ARC's knowitalls can understand him when he speaks Latin is questionable: chances are that our pronunciation of Latin has drifted almost as much as the living languages.

</li><li> The Czechoslovakian sci-fi series for kids <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVisitors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVisitors">The Visitors</a></em> (1983) had a group of scientists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">who travelled from the year 2484 to the year 1984</a>, visiting a small Czech town and trying to retrieve a formula that would save the Earth. The human society was peacefully united and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">the main language of humanity was apparently Czech</a>. Eternal Czech was not even an issue and communication with local people was more or less fine, save for some cultural stuff. Something as universal as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm">Face Palm</a> is apparently unknown on Earth in this vision of blissful and very much Star-Trek-esque future. Professor Richard thought that fore-head slapping is a form of greeting.
</li><li> There's an <strong>extremely</strong> ludicrous example, not featuring English, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E2FourToDoomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E2FourToDoomsday">Four To Doomsday</a>", in which the white Australian character Tegan is able to communicate in an Australian Aborigine language with an Aboriginal character who was supposedly abducted from Earth by aliens 40,000 years before her time. This is implausible not just on grounds of linguistic drift, wherein we have NO attestations or models of any languages spoken 40,000 years ago, but also because there are many different indigenous languages in Australia, most of them mutually unintelligible, and because it would be extremely unlikely for any urban white Australian (Tegan comes from Brisbane) to speak any Aboriginal language fluently unless they had made a special effort to do so for political or cultural reasons. In terms of plausibility, it would be like being able to communicate with Cro Magnon man by virtue of knowing modern Haitian Creole. (Many fans assume that the TARDIS was tactfully translating for her and letting her think that she was speaking the same language.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>, not only does everyone in the future speak English, but they do so with a posh Received Pronunciation accent. Granted, we're not told how far in the future this is, nor their exact history, so it's possible media kept the language and accent mostly the same for centuries.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100">The 100</a></em>, the characters who grew up on the Ark speak standard American English, having maintained continuity with present-day civilization, but the Grounders down on Earth, who've been living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland for almost a hundred years, speak a language called <a class="urllink" href="http://the100.wikia.com/wiki/Trigedasleng">Trigedasleng<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that, while clearly derived from English, is virtually incomprehensible otherwise. The Grounders have preserved English as a trade language, which would reduce linguistic drift.

They lose track of him, but assume they should be able to find him easily enough, since he only speaks ancient Sumerian. Maze, one of the demons who tortured Abel over the millennia, explains that's not the case. The demons got bored just putting him in the exact same situation over and over, so they started changing it up by putting him into more modern situations. He learned quite a few languages, including English, and proved to be able to think very quick on his feet.

No matter what time period the Lifeboat crew travels to, they have no problem communicating in English or, in one case, French. Even during the American Revolution and the French and Indian War.

When she awakens, Korean appears to be exactly the same, and so much to her new family's annoyance, she has no trouble speaking her mind.

<ul><li> Language change is a constant, which causes problems in real life — the written form of the language tends to freeze at a certain point in development, while the spoken language keeps changing. This causes definite problems in literacy, even when merely limited to works of literature and legal documents. Eventually the literary and vernacular languages become totally different (called <em>diglossia</em> by linguists, Greek for "two tongues"), and later still the spoken language becomes the new written standard in place of the old one. This is what happened to Latin (replaced by Romance languages), Classical Chinese (replaced by Standard Mandarin) and Classical Greek (replaced by Modern Greek), among others.
<ul><li> This is still the case with the Tamil language of South India. The written standard is still mostly the same as it was in around the 14th century, while the spoken form kept on changing, resulting in a written form that contains extra vowels and diacritics that no one actually pronounces. This is further complicated by the fact that different social classes speak drastically different dialects that use different words derived from completely different roots to represent the same concept.
</li><li> This is somewhat the case with another Indian language, Hindi. Its written form is Sanskritized to an extreme extent, like replacing Persian, Arabic and English loanwords with Sanskrit ones even when they were assimilated. This makes the formal register Sanskrit in all but grammar.
</li><li> This is also somewhat the case with Arabic, where the written language is closely based on Classical Arabic, spoken at the time of the Qur'an. Colloquial Arabic differs greatly from it and there are several spoken dialects which are closer or further apart from each other. A common debate among Arab intellectuals these days is whether or not to change the standard language. On one extreme, you have classicizers who think that all the modern dialects are rubbish, and on the other, you have local nationalists who want to break up the Arabic language altogether. Even the middle is somewhat divided: there are some who think the situation is fine as-is, or with minimal changes, while others advocate abandoning the current standard and creation of a new one based on the educated speech of Cairo (Egyptian Arabic is more or less universally understood, and Cairo is unquestionably the center of modern Arabic-language culture).
</li><li> Tibetan's standard orthography hasn't changed since the 1100s, and is essentially the same in all the Buddhist Tibetan-speaking regions. Amazing for a language that went from having complex consonant clusters and no tones, to having much simpler consonants and many dialects having developed tones to make up for lost consonants. (To give an example, the Dalai Lama's surname 'Gyatso' (generally pronounced <em>chatso</em>) is spelled <em>rgyam-tsho</em> natively.)
</li><li> After the fall of the Roman Empire in the west, literate people (i.e., monks) continued to write in semi-classical Latin, while the spoken Latin language evolved into several Romance languages, though these were still considered "Latin". By the time anybody realized that what people were speaking was no longer Latin, it had become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredLanguage">Sacred Language</a> in the Catholic Church.
<ul><li> Also note that thanks to Humanist and early Renaissance scholarship, there was a revival of classical Latin among scholars and scientists at the expense of the way Church Latin had evolved in the Early and High Middle Ages.
</li></ul></li><li> Also the case with Burmese, where there is a formal written language and a spoken form which is never written. They are pronounced quite differently.
</li><li> Officially, Afrikaans kept spelling in Dutch until a few years into the 20th century, although some people spelled phonetically before then. One reason for this is that at the time, most people (even the majority of Afrikaans speakers) considered the language to be a dialect of Dutch. Since acknowledging a dialect's status as a language would usually go hand in hand with translating the Bible into it, many Afrikaans speakers were reluctant to do so, considering it disrespectful to translate Scripture into what was then still widely regarded as an uneducated-sounding, slang-littered dialect.
</li><li> It's also pretty much the reason that English spelling is so different from its pronunciation—why does the word "why" have an <em>h</em> in it? Because in the olden days, it was pronounced "hwy". Likewise, the <em>k</em> in words like "knight" and "knife" used to be pronounced (and they still are in their Scandinavian equivalents). Not likewise, but on the same note, we have words like "due", "dew" and "do" which are pronounced the same because in the olden days, they weren't homonyms. Combine this with etymological spellings (<em>homage</em> from French), <em>false</em> etymological spellings (<em>island</em> is <em>not</em> from Latin <em>insula</em> and didn't have an S until people thought it was), and the like, and you basically get modern written English.
<ul><li> The related Scots language, though, takes a more phonetic form, in part because no universally accepted standard has existed since the eighteenth century. Scots has also retained the voiceless velar fricative or "hard ch", meaning that many of the superfluous appearances of "gh" in English- "through", "night", "thought", etc.- are actively pronounced in Scots.
</li></ul></li><li> English gets a bad rap, but people tend to not mention that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsSexierInFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsSexierInFrench">French</a> is also very different from its written form. To an Anglophone learner, it may seem as if half of every word is silent because they represent sounds which are no longer pronounced but included for etymological reasons. However, it's much easier to guess how a French word is pronounced once you learn the basic rules - if a word ends in P,T,S or D, it's not pronounced, for example. English, on the other hand, has so many irregularities that it's almost impossible to have any kind of confidence about your guess. For example, "ou" in French is nearly always pronounced "oo" (except before a vowel as in "oui" where it becomes a more consonant-ish "w") while in English it can be pronounced "oo", "oh", "aw" or "ow" and the context gives no hints whatsoever.
<ul><li> Recently the French Academy has instituted spelling changes originally proposed in 1990 such as getting rid of the circumflex over vowels in many instances, changing the spelling of some words, and eliminating the hyphen in the middle of many compound words (<em>mille-pattes</em> becoming <em>millepattes</em>)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> You might think a logographic written language such as Chinese would remain readable even after millennia, but that's only partially true. Modern Chinese writing, for example, gradually shifted closer to how people speak, known as vernacular Chinese. This shift had its roots during the Yuan Dynasty, and would become more commonplace in the later Ming &amp; Qing Dynasties. However, this came at the expense of rendering people less able to comprehend texts written in Classical Chinese, though Classical Chinese courses are still required courses in schools. Yet, even the so-called "traditional characters" haven't been around forever. The first Chinese text was found on the so-called Oracle Bone script more than 3000 years ago. Most Chinese speakers would have a hard time reading <em>anything</em> from that period as the characters are practically unrecognisable. Nonetheless, traditional Chinese gained its form during the Qin Dynasty, then cemented during the Han Dynasty more than 2,000 years ago, and remained relatively consistent. In relation to other languages, Chinese writings from 2,000 years ago are comparatively recognizable and comprehensible.
<ul><li> Another thing to note is that Chinese characters encode concepts and not sound. Many of them are also a combination of two or more characters in order to convey certain context. Moreover, when Chinese characters get adapted for writing other languages which have <em>never</em> been related (such as Korean and Japanese), written texts can be partially readable across language boundaries because of shared meaning of glyphs. You can potentially learn to read Chinese without knowing how to say a thing. This is only possible since there was no unified Chinese 'tongue' until recently, thus a writing system based on sound would have been utterly inconvenient. In addition, Chinese grammar tends to be far simpler than the aforementioned languages, thus it was less complicated to adapt.
</li><li> To show how much the Chinese languages have changed, historical linguistics has hypothesized that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius">Confucius</a> (which is just a Latinized form of Kong Fuzi) would have been called Kʰˤoŋʔ Kʷʰə during his lifetime. His courtesy name was even more different — Truŋsnˤərs instead of Zhongni.
</li></ul></li><li> The oldest dictionary of Japanese is <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippo_Jisho">Nippo Jisho,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> a Japanese-Portuguese bilingual dictionary of the late 1500s, showing both romaji, kanji and katakana of various words. The language drift and phonemes which existed in the 16th century but are no longer extant in Modern Japanese provide good insight on the changes of the Japanese language. Also the <em>meanings</em> of the words have changed. e.g. <em>samurai</em> meant "noble" but <em>bushi</em> meant "soldier", "warrior".
</li><li> The Ugro-Finnic languages of Northern Europe are an interesting <em>spoken</em> example. Languages like Finnish and Estonian have been separated for millennia, but still have a large amount of remarkably similar words. Finnish in particular is famous in linguistics for being a slow-mutating language, with quite a few ancient loanwords mostly "frozen" in place from the time they were originally loaned. An example of this is <em>kuningas</em> meaning "king", which was loaned about <em>three millennia ago</em> from Proto-Germanic <em>kuningaz</em>, of which the English word "king" is a far more mutated genetic descendant.
<ul><li> The Finnish written language is notoriously different from the spoken variations and it's often thought, even by Finns, that the language has just changed as in the other cases. In fact, the Finnish written language is a rather rare example of one that's actually not based on any specific dialect. Since there were major arguments about which dialect to use as the basis, the intellectuals of the time ended up creating a new mixed dialect which had never actually been spoken by anyone before. So, in some ways, it's the other way around.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern Icelandic speakers often have less trouble understanding thousand-year-old Old Norse than modern Danish speakers have understanding modern Swedish speakers. It's said that Leifr Eiríksson, the first European in America, would be able to be understood in 21st-century Iceland.
<ul><li> Iceland being quite isolated from the rest of the world helps. It also "helps" that Denmark and Sweden have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerVersusDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerVersusDragon">enemies since the countries were formed.</a> Heck, even longer, back before they were properly formed. The government has actually manipulated the language (through schools and official texts) to be dissimilar.
</li></ul></li><li> Sanskrit and Lithuanian are two notoriously slow-mutating languages in the Indo-European family. Sanskrit is so old that hymns composed before the time of King Tut can still be chanted with with near-perfect accuracy (although a large fraction of the word meanings themselves have been largely forgotten). An Indian priest from the time of Christ would be able to speak much the same Sanskrit and chant the same prayers as a modern Hindu priest. And as for knowing how the ancient speakers of the Indo-European languages talked, you need to listen to a Lithuanian villager talking (the Lithuanian language, separated by thousands of miles from Sanskrit, retains nearly identical words for many things, unchanged for millenia.)
<ul><li> And there's the dying relative of Sanskrit, the Old Avestan language of the Zoroastrian religion, still chanted by the few surviving Zoroastrian communities existent.
</li></ul></li><li> For a straight example, the page quote itself. That's obvious in some cases, of course (eek? hadden prys?), but it's even trickier than it may appear. There's at least one false friend in there. "Nyce", to Chaucer, meant approximately what "stupid" means to us.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesII">James II</a> supposedly described St Paul's Cathedral as "awful", "amusing" and "artificial" — i.e. worthy of awe, giving pleasure and made with artifice.
</li><li> The English formal written language has remained almost unchanged from the late 1800s on, but the spoken language is almost alien to a speaker from 1700. That said, unless both people were to speak entirely in their absolutely most informal kind of speech, they would have absolutely no trouble being <em>understood</em>—the words would simply sound weird.
</li></ul></li><li> Even though it <em>did</em> lose its incredibly complex and powerful tense system and is still leaking cases, Russian is a remarkably slow-changing language. A 12th-century epic poem "The Tale of Igor's Campaign" is still (barely) understandable to the modern speaker, for example. Even the 9-10th century texts (like the Novgorodian birchbark letters) can be figured out by the readers uneducated in the language. Old Russian also gave birth to Ukrainian and Belarusian languages which are in some aspects (especially grammar) closer to Old Russian than modern Russian is (which was based on local version of liturgical (so called Church Slavonic) language rather than on vernacular Old Russian).
<ul><li> In contrast, Bulgarian has so drastically changed its grammar (for example, dropping all cases and acquiring a definite article), and also to a large extent its lexicon, that to modern Bulgarians, medieval Bulgarian texts look closer to Russian than to modern Bulgarian.
<ul><li> Medieval Bulgarian probably <em>is</em> closer to Russian than to modern Bulgarian, in terms of its characteristics, just like Old English works more like Icelandic than it does like modern English.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similar to the Finnish example above, Irish and Scots Gaelic are two Goidelic languages that diverged from one another 1600 years ago. Yet despite this, and despite both going through many many changes in that time, they are still mutually intelligible, and indeed share an estimated 70% of their vocabulary.
</li><li> A subdivision of creationists is Babelists, who believe in, yes, Eternal English.
</li><li> Hebrew is an example in that, while there are definitely obvious differences between Biblical and Modern Hebrew, one can nevertheless understand a lot of Biblical passages on the strength of a Modern Hebrew education alone. But this is kind of cheating, since Hebrew was revitalized as a vernacular in the 19th century, so it didn't have the same kind of organic growth as other languages would have.
<ul><li> For instance, students in Israel going on a field trip to see the Dead Sea Scrolls can simply <em>read them unaided</em>. It's helpful to think of the relation between Biblical and Modern Hebrew as similar to that between Shakespearean and Modern English.
<ul><li> They can read them, yes, but the changed meaning of many words can results in severe misunderstandings. As for pronunciation...well, the Yemenite Jews still retain one close to the original, but the other dialects differ considerably. As an example, there are six letters which are supposed to be read differently at the beginning of the word or after a consonant - it's called <em>dagesh</em>. Modern Israeli Hebrew only retains the rule for three - V/B, KH/K, and F/P. G, T and D are always pronounced as a <em>dagesh</em> form.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The changing nature of languages has raised some issues on how to mark toxic waste dumps so that future civilisations who would not understand modern languages are not endangered by this. The proposed solutions range from plausible, like putting up obelisks with pictorial warnings on them, to breeding cats that glow when in range of radiation and hoping people associate it with danger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">to launching an artificial moon over the site.</a>
<ul><li> Of course, the real problem is that putting any sort of sign, even one depicting clear danger or death, will likely be interpreted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait">"Hey, there's something interesting here!"</a> and start digging. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">It's like how archaeologists pay little attention to the supposed "Curse of the Pharaohs" when opening Egyptian tombs.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zigzagged</a> by Latin. It's a language that, despite being outmoded and dead, is still used for some purposes, but has undergone dozens of revisions. Despite that, vanilla Latin is still in use as a form of <em>lingua franca</em> in some circles (such as science) but is also being edited today due to a sparsity of words. Latin is included among the European Union's 'Official Languages' in which all documents are to be published. Which requires tricky transliteration when writing about concepts Latin had no 'words' for, such as modern economic policies, industrial or environmental regulations, and farming subsidies. The Vatican has a whole department devoted to coming up with neo-Latin words for modern concepts.
</li><li> Similar to the Finnish example above, Romance languages remain extremely similar to each other (and some are in fact mutually intelligible) in spite of starting to diverge about 1,500 years ago. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> by the deep interactions between the peoples speaking them, getting speakers of Spanish, Portuguese, French and the other languages to influence each other's vocabulary and grammar.
</li><li> Linguistic drift can happen ridiculously fast as a result of geopolitical divides. American English made several concerted efforts to distinguish itself from British English, to the point that several linguists believed they would evolve in completely different directions (which almost happened until modern telecommunications eased the drift). China and Taiwan are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">Separated by a Common Language</a> after merely <em>fifty</em> years of not speaking to one another. In Korea, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">the Northern government</a> sought to keep the language more "pure" (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Newspeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Newspeak">altered the meaning of some words for ideological reasons</a>), while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">the Southern government</a> largely embraced loanwords and linguistic drift, such that language differences are often considered <a class="urllink" href="https://www.voanews.com/archive/sixty-years-after-division-korean-language-has-gone-separate-directions">the biggest obstacle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Northern defectors to overcome as they integrate into the South. And let's not get started on the variety of regional dialects you can find in any given country.
</li><li> Italian language experienced surprisingly little drift from its first written examples in the late 13th century, as a direct consequence of having been born as a literary language based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florence">Firenze's</a> dialect and remaining mostly fixed until it started being spoken by the people in the 19th century, finally starting the drift.
