</li><li> Also, the young Italies used to live with their grandfather Ancient Rome until his "death", then were taken in either by Austria and Hungary (Chibitalia) or Spain (Chibimano).

</li><li> Takeshi Sendoh from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>. His mother died few after he was born (<em>maybe</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">because of childbirth</a>, but it's not specified), his father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty when Sendoh was around five years old.

She was also the one who provided him the money with her own savings to go to Japan. He desired to join the NFL so his grandmother would no longer have to work.
</li><li> Misaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaNoMizoShiru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaNoMizoShiru">Hana no Mizo Shiru</a></em> was raised by his grandfather after his parents died in accident...for a few years, until <em>he</em> died, too. Then he's left in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyMentor">Kawabata's</a> care, which doesn't really end well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan">Kotoura-san</a></em>, after Haruka was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">disowned</a> by her parents, it was implied she was raised by her grandfather Zenzou.

</li><li> Takuto, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarDriver">Star Driver</a></em> was raised by his grandfather who also taught him the art of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a> swordfighting and how to use his Cybody. It seems like his mother left her son with Icaro at an extremely early age, as Takuto only knows what she looks like from one single photo. The female protagonist, Wako, also seems to have been raised by her grandmother alone, although we never get to hear what actually happened with her parents.
