It inspires an anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, who respond to them in such a way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">you'd think they had committed some unspeakable atrocity</a>. This stems from some specific trait that draws ire in these groups: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel">Necessary Weasel</a> they don't understand or appreciate, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">trope</a> that's designed exclusively for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetAudience">Target Audience</a> (i.e. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Kid-Appeal Character</a>), a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> that ruins the work's reputation, or an execution that really <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible">bad</a> on its own merits.
</p><p>This is not to say that the dislike is always undeserved. We live in a mass-media world now, and any major pop-culture phenomenon is going to make at least some in-roads into the mainstream and show up on our radar whether it's aimed at us or not. When a work's popularity reaches far beyond its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetAudience">Target Audience</a>, it becomes susceptible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> as it draws in audiences it was never intended for. The hatedom is likely to be amplified if the work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaintedByThePreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaintedByThePreview">leaves a bad first impression</a> upon first being announced, as they wouldn't have been as forgiving as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetAudience">Target Audience</a> in the first place.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In the worst case scenario, it may become inescapable, or prove so popular in its demographic that those attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> choke out any innovation in other programming for a period. Of course, a Periphery Hatedom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">can help make things even more inescapable</a>, even well after the pop-culture phenomenon's popularity has died down. Given enough time, even an otherwise benign Periphery Hatedom can look fanatical to disinterested third parties, who are as likely to direct their pleas of "Will you just <em>shut up</em> about it already?!" to the haters as to the fans.
</p><p>Keep in mind that some of the stuff that was marketed towards you when <em>you</em> were a kid had a Periphery Hatedom at the time, and the kids who love a kid-oriented work with a Periphery Hatedom may grow up to become the adults who hate some new kid-oriented work, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">while still viewing the stuff they themselves enjoyed as kids as pure quality</a>.

If the Periphery Hatedom proves that the work relies too heavily on on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicMediumIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicMediumIgnorance">Public Medium Ignorance</a> and isn't good even for its intended audience, then they can have a point ("Just because something is made for kids, that doesn't mean they are free to treat them like idiots"). A work that isn't good enough to develop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> risks having its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic">Fleeting Demographic</a> join the Periphery Hatedom once they become of age, if they didn't already hate the work by then.

Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>, where a backlash occurs against something people have been told they'd like.
</p><p>Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Music" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Music">music</a> examples overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseGenre">Dead Horse Genre</a>. Can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco">Deader Than Disco</a> when a work's target demographic stops liking it and joins in on the bashing. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">Americans Hate Tingle</a> for regional examples. Can be caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">What Do You Mean, It's for Kids?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> are a specific type of Periphery Hatedom, who sometimes subvert the trope by directing their complaints at how they think the work will affect its <em>intended</em> audience. However, they often play it straight by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">getting the target audience wrong</a>, typically by assuming that everything of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">a particular genre</a> must be kid-appropriate. Tangentially related are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">Straw Hypocrite</a> (hating someone for not sincerely holding beliefs that the hater never admired in the first place) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawAffiliation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawAffiliation">Straw Affiliation</a> (criticizing someone for not being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">"true"</a> exemplar of a group to which the critic does not belong). There's also the targeted race in cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableEthnicTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableEthnicTargets">Acceptable Ethnic Targets</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalStereotypes">National Stereotypes</a>, who <em>all</em> hate said subject matter, which is always justifiable.

</p><p>Remember, this trope is specifically for examples where the hate comes from not pleasing a group that it never planned to reach in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">Complaining About Shows You Don't Watch</a> when you're <em>within</em> its intended audience is not this trope.

<ul><li> Much of the content of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em> harshly satirizes franchises, shows, and films that the target readership (mostly young teenage boys) could not be expected to have any real interest in, including soap operas, Hollywood dramas, and children's cartoons. The magazine's iconic comic strip parodies are always written with a tone of exasperated annoyance  even when mocking things that aren't really that omnipresent in the culture.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerds</a> that make up the main male cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> are sometimes looked down on by Penny the non-nerd in playing tabletop RPGs, MMORPGs, card games, video games, and liking comic books, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>.</em> As Penny gets to know them better, she develops more respect for their hobbies, even participating in some of them.
</li><li> <em>Mary Moo Cow</em>, the Barney <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> universe, is this to the titular character of the show — the theme song itself (which is sung <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToTheTuneOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToTheTuneOf">To the Tune of</a> <em>Frere Jacques</em>, a common trait of shows with Periphery Hatedom) is known to aggravate Arthur. The <em>Tina the Talking Tabby</em> commercial in <em>Arthur's Perfect Christmas</em> and <em>Vidiboobies</em> (one of the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatzs</a> of Teletubbies in the show's universe) has the same net effect on Arthur.

Arthur becomes a fan of the show despite his friends mocking him and saying that it's "a baby show". That is, until they start watching it as well and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">begin enjoying it for its surreal content</a>.

</li><li> Despite this, some parts of the anime avoid this, for various reasons. The first few seasons are well loved in Japan for Takeshi Shudo's trying to make the show for kids and their parents alike, and have a very active nostalgia-driven fanbase in the West.

Harleys are more frequently customised and thus have a major aftermarket scene with dozens of companies selling parts (as in enough to build a <em>workalike</em> Harley clone), while Japanese bikes are typically left as they are by their owners (although there has been a metric customisation scene especially in recent years), which may have led to the likes of Honda being deemed more reliable. That said, the technology utilised on Harleys are more or less still based on those first introduced in the 1930s, and while this has since been replaced by more modern parts and has incorporated technology such as fuel injection and computer-controlled engine management systems, Harley's reliance on traditionalism and thus holding on to older tech earned them the ire of detractors.

There are also people who hate it due to it bouncing back and forth between treating its target audience (children) like they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">are smarter than they look</a> and treating them like they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">have the IQ of a rotten potato</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouseClubhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouseClubhouse">Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</a></em>, popular among the toddler set it's aimed at, has earned mixed reviews from critics and Disney fans alike for putting their mascot and company into a toddler show, but it's the many people on social networks who have a deep hate for it that tend to be most vocal about it. The fact that Disney kept this show running for 10 years straight does NOT help matters, nor does the fact that they market Mickey's <em>Clubhouse</em> incarnation more aggressively childishly than his earlier, more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>-friendly appearances.

The other half generally averts this trope, with works like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013">Mickey Mouse (2013)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">1987</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">2017</a> versions of <em>DuckTales</em>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey">Epic Mickey</a></em> video games, but still suffer from this trope to a small extent by association.

Which actually led to Disney restoring Christopher Robin back into the show in later seasons, although it still wasn't enough (Christopher Robin was still demoted to a minor character and didn't appear in as many episodes as fans would like).

The fact that Pull-Ups Training Pants (or Pampers, depending on your region) is the show's primary sponsor only adds to the irk (Disney Junior is a premium network which costs extra on top of the basic kids package on some Pay TV providers. Understandably, parents were irked when they have to put up with advertising on a channel that they're already paying extra for).

</li><li> Before <em>Nina Needs To Go!</em>, Disney Junior had <em>This is Daniel Cook</em>. People hated it because the titular character always acted excited no matter what the situation was. The hate has died down, however, now that the show hasn't been seen for plenty of years.
</li><li> All three Disney series created by Noah Z. Jones (who also created <em>Almost Naked Animals</em>, covered below) fall into this.

It wasn't until <em>Hannah Montana</em> and <em>High School Musical</em> were made that said types of series, and eventually all of Disney Channel's live-action programming altogether, began shifting their focus from everyday situations to becoming famous in some way. While there are some exceptions to this, the increasingly teen-oriented and fame-centered live-action series that were made caused a massive change in the network's programming, which alienated many.</span> Straight males, females born before 1989, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">tomboys</a>, feminists, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> make up a sizable hatedom to both franchises.

</li><li> Adult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">Muppet</a> fans have a history of forming Periphery Hatedoms towards movies that directly compete with, and outdraw, the newer Muppet movies. These movies usually aren't for their demographic and get much worse reviews than the well-reviewed Muppet movies. 2011's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em>, despite getting rave reviews, was outdrawn by a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> sequel (described in "Literature", below) and an <em>Alvin and the Chipmunks</em> threequel (described just above), both of which got pretty bad reviews. Needless to say, Muppet fans now don't take very kindly to young-adult female novel adaptations or half live-action half-CGI kiddie movies based on archaic cartoon characters. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsMostWanted">Muppets Most Wanted</a></em> got this even worse; not only was it beaten by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent">Divergent</a></em> (a YA adaptation) at the box office, but it was even turned into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">Acclaimed Flop</a> due to the competition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry">Tyler Perry</a>'s movies have created a series of minor racism controversies based on the fact that they tend to be critically-drubbed by the vast majority of critics (most of whom are white), yet are extraordinarily popular in the black community, which has turned these movies into #1 hits. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> seemed to be a particular target. On top of that, Perry also experiences this among black viewers. Perry got his start staging plays on what's sometimes called the "Chitlin' Circuit", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaudeville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaudeville">vaudeville-esque</a> black theater circuit which primarily caters to older, more conservative, and more religious audiences.

Perry even threatened to pull some of his content from TBS after one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> made harsh fun of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> tendencies of Perry's movies. Either way, Perry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">caters to a very specific demographic</a> with which many African Americans do not identify.

Some may feel it's an easy work of fiction to avoid due to limited mainstream marketing, though this depends on where you live, such as if you're in an area where typical <em>Left Behind</em> readers are the majority (though even then, it's hardly on the level of <em>Twilight</em>). However, much like some of the <em>Twilight</em> hatred, the criticism is sometimes about what the stories are indicative of, and what influence they have on the readers in the intended demographic. And then there are those people who just find apocalyptic (non)fiction creepy, and wish people would just keep their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">End Of the World As We Know It</a> fantasies — or beliefs — to themselves.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series attracts both legions of fans even in this very wiki, and even larger legions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a>, some of whom have never read the books or seen the movies, and some who have.

The hate for <em>Twilight</em> among Goths seems to be particularly vitriolic. Anyone expressing love for <em>Twilight</em> is generally met with an icy or hostile reception. Events specifically to bash <em>Twilight</em> are common. The Hatedom got so big that it created a whole new fandom. The riffs off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">film adaptations</a> of this series on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax">RiffTrax</a> became the most popular and anticipated riffs.

It was never made for either of these groups: Lewis wrote it for children who were <em>already</em> Christian (not to convert those who weren't) to explore their faith through a more accessible framework than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. He even got angry letters from some parents for his apparent blasphemy in supposedly turning Jesus into a lion; Lewis responded that children often see animals as people, so it's not blasphemous to <em>them</em>.

This goes even beyond the disdain for being forced to read (and analyze) classics in school, as <em>Effi Briest</em> was simply never aimed at a young adult audience. Even most teachers are able to admit that they themselves only learned to enjoy the book when they were well into middle age. And they <em>studied</em> literature in college, so they <em>better</em> enjoy German classics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> is often particularly hated by boys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolStudyMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolStudyMedia">who have to read it in high school English</a>. It's easy to see why; it is written in a dense 19th-century prose, features a group of sisters as its main characters, and has a plot that focuses on their efforts to get hitched. Not usual boy stuff.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBerenstainBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBerenstainBears">The Berenstain Bears</a></em> has quite a bit of hatred that comes from parents who despise the books for being shallow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> stories that are so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> that they forget they're trying to tell a story at all. This isn't completely unjustified; first off, this comes from parents who are forced to read the books to their kids all the time because of course, their kids love them, but even those who don't completely hate the books will reluctantly admit these are genuine problems, especially evidenced by the serious cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a>.

Hate from the BDSM community counts as periphery. Despite the BDSM themes and scenes in the novels the BDSM community is not the target audience. Its target audience is consumers of fantasy romance novels.

They probably would not have heard of the show if it were not for the already existing Periphery Hatedom and their watching of the channel it's on. One big reason for the hate from people outside the demographic is because it would often air at times when college students were watching TV, so, at the series' peak in popularity, it was pretty hard to escape. Barney hatred was so deeply ingrained into the elementary-school-age community during the 90s and 2000s that some kids would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMarioLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMarioLimit">automatically hate</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMarioLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMarioLimit">anything</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMarioLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMarioLimit">named Barney, from real people to fictional characters</a>. However, the hate against Barney has died down over the years, mainly due to the TV series fading from relevance and ultimately being cancelled in 2010 (in October 2015, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mipcom-barney-friends-set-relaunch-829728">it was announced that the series would be relaunched in 2017, but it didn't come to pass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). In addition, the show's original viewers, who generally view the series in a more positive light, have grown up.
</li><li> Barney hate is referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicParkIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicParkIII">Jurassic Park III</a></em>: one character manages to get a phone call in to an old friend's house to call for help, but unfortunately her infant son picks up the phone and forgets all about it as a Barney video plays on TV.

He'd rather his kids were entertained by a real dinosaur.
<div class="indent"><strong>Harry:</strong> It's not even realistic...
</div></li><li> The music video for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">Jurassic Park</a>" featured a scene with Barney getting his head bitten off by an even larger dinosaur. It later gets coughed back up. When this video is played during his concerts, that particular scene is met with roaring applause and cheer by the audience. Weird Al has taken jabs at the purple dinosaur in several other of his music videos, too. For example, the animated music video "I'll Sue Ya!" featured a familiarly colored toy dinosaur chewing on someone's mutilated arm in one scene.
</li><li> The song "Barney's on Fire" by Tony Mason is all about this, to the point that even the audience delight in the gristly spectacle and actively refuse to help, even though they're aware there's a perfectly normal actor in that suit <em>who is dying horribly</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a> taken to a horrifying level.

Barney's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualSmiler">Perpetual Smiler</a> design and personality prevents him from doing that, however, hence why he doesn't hold up as well as other media for young children.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeresHumphrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeresHumphrey">Here's Humphrey</a></em>: Humphrey B. Bear can be viewed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">Australian</a> Barney, due to the way he is hated by many pre-teens in his homeland for his goofy antics, as well as having a human co-host that talks down to the viewers. Like pre-teens from other developed countries, Australian pre-teens don't like being talked down to either, and like pre-teens from other developed countries, the pre-teen boys naturally dislike being around girls. However, Humphrey invokes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> sooner — most Australians tend to remember him more favorably by the time they reach their late teens. Barney <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a> usually doesn't fade and get replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> until the former viewer-cum-hater has started a family, which by time he/she will be in the late 20s or early 30s (and sometimes, it doesn't even leave). The fact that Humphrey's co-host is usually a hot chick (albeit one that talks down to kids) probably helps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies">Teletubbies</a></em>: If Barney is the king of this trope, then the Teletubbies are worthy company for him. While it has the usual Periphery Hatedom, some concerned parents made waves when it was thought that the nonsense speech of the main characters might be hurting the verbal development of its target audience at a time when their babbling starts to cohere into words and basic sentences. There's also the argument that <em>any</em> television program is bad for a target audience at a developmental period where they're mainly learning how to move. It's possible to believe that the people actually making the show did their best with the content and still think the primary intent and effect of the show's existence was to increase the exposure of infants to TV commercials and brand logos (a frankly bizarre claim given that it was first made by and shown on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> and got exposure in America on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a>, both of which have <strong>no adverts</strong>).
</li><li> <em>The Lawrence Welk Show</em>, in the 1970s and since. It was enormously popular when it was new, in the '50s, but by the time it had lasted 20 years, the number of people in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">periphery demographics</a> far outnumbered the people for whom it was originally intended. Even in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, comedians like Sid Caesar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllanSherman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllanSherman">Allan Sherman</a> mocked it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">Tastes Like Diabetes</a> reactionary fantasy.

The over-done art direction and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">eerily persistent grins</a> even seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">eerily inhuman</a> to some people. It also featured many regional acts tailored to please Vaudeville and State Fair audiences. Broad, diverse TV audiences probably felt some stylistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. If you want an idea of how behind-the-times <em>The Lawrence Welk Show</em> was even in its day, consider the episode that had a tribute to America's ethnic diversity. The most exotic ethnic group featured were...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">the Italians</a>. Even by the 1970s, Welk was still shown to be out of touch with the times, an infamous example being introducing Brewer and Shipley's 1971 hit "One Toke Over the Line" as a "modern spiritual" (when in fact it was a mock spiritual, and then vice-president Spiro Agnew claimed it was subversive). Although some contemporary songs slowly found their way onto the show  for instance, one 1975 episode had cast members singing covers of Captain &amp; Tennille's "Love Will Keep Us Together" and Morris Albert's "Feelings," while another featured Three Dog Night's "An Old-Fashioned Love Song"  the show still relied heavily on pre-1955 (namely, big band, patriotic, sacred and pop standards) for its songs. Even as late as the mid-1970s, there were many households that had one television set, meaning if the parents liked it, the children  especially teenagers, who winced at the mere mention of music they considered "square," "unlistenable" and outdated  had little choice but to either watch, go to a friend's house or do something else. Ironically for a show derided almost from the outset as hopelessly dated and old-fashioned, episodes and reruns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticProof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticProof">have continued to appear more-or-less nonstop on television for over sixty years now</a>, somehow managing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">outlast</a> countless hipper programs with much younger audiences.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> Elmo became less than popular to a large number of the show's longtime fans, mainly because the show's focus somehow shifted onto him and less on the other Muppets and characters. Made worse by Sesame Workshop deciding to assign a fifteen-minute segment of <em>Sesame Street</em> to the segment <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElmosWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElmosWorld">Elmo's World</a></em>, and giving the segment an ending song set to a traditional song (Jingle Bells), like fellow children's show <em>Barney &amp; Friends.</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8bikt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8bikt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8bikt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Half an hour in certain markets, made possible by airing two episodes back to back. Said network also tend to butcher <em>Sesame Street</em> so that it runs for only a half hour to allow the two episodes of Elmo's World to run back to back, leading the less-informed to think that Sesame Workshop did shorten the show to allow more time for <em>Elmo's World</em>.</span> Much of the intended demographic loved it, however.
</li><li> Averted with <em>Elmo: The Musical</em> due to it actually being entertaining and having cameos by Muppet puppets that haven't appeared on the show since the 90's. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">30th anniversary special</a> <em>Elmopalooza</em> is also an aversion due to having plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">adult appeal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesameStreetCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesameStreetCred">musical artists and celebrities as guest stars</a>.
</li><li> Children who have just outgrown <em>Sesame Street</em> have been known to hate the show and equate it to <em>Barney</em>, due to their being too young to understand the show's honest efforts to educate children and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">keep their parents amused</a> — and <em>Sesame Street</em> predates <em>Barney and Friends</em> by about a quarter of a century.
</li><li> A few adults also feel this way towards <em>Sesame Street</em> — not because of any lack of quality, but because it has an active, loving adult/teen fanbase that rarely has anything bad to say about the show, and viral segments from the show tend to be universally praised. This can baffle people who don't really see the appeal in a show that is (and always will be) an educational program for very young children.
</li><li> Showing that history can indeed repeat itself, Abby is currently getting the same treatment as Elmo, mainly from the generation of young adults and teens that grew up watching and fell in love with Elmo.

Basically, the root cause of the hatedom here is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenerationGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenerationGap">The Generation Gap</a> combined with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>, combined with a heaping dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>.

It also doesn't help that watching telenovelas has become a stereotype of Mexicans. Interestingly, only Mexican telenovelas seem to elicit this reaction, works produced in other countries such as Brazil, Colombia, the United States (those produced by Telemundo) or Europe are either ignored or actually enjoyed and praised by some people in the aforementioned demographics. This attitude is also present in other Latin American countries, with local output being bashed while foreign output is lauded, and has actually made impact ratings-wise, with foreign novelas sometimes getting better ratings than local ones.

</li><li> Two of the biggest, longest running sitcoms ever on Belgian television, which are called <em>Thuis</em> and <em>Familie</em>, suffer heavily from this. There is a die-hard and big fan base for both series, but plenty of people have heard of both series because of how long they have aired on their respective channels and absolutely loath both shows, decrying that the series ruin Belgian television. The fact that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162076/">''Thuis''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162076/">''Familie''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> both have very low ratings on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> (the latter having an even lower score than some shows in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/LiveActionTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/LiveActionTV">Live-Action TV</a> entry in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible">So Bad, It's Horrible</a> ) despite having very active forums full of fans speaking about the new things that are happening in the show is a testament to this.
</li><li> Anything from syndicator Litton Entertainment will inevitably get this, regardless of what they put out (Jack Hanna being an occasional exception due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaGoggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaGoggles">nostalgia</a>), mainly for holding what's seen as a monopoly on Saturday morning kids' fare, replacing the once-popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon">Saturday Morning Cartoon</a> with unscripted nature documentaries, cooking shows, and lifestyle shows, all genres by and large considered boring and uninteresting by most younger people, including the intended target audience of teenagers. Not helping matters is that <a class="urllink" href="http://deadline.com/2016/06/kids-tv-shows-saturday-mornings-fcc-loophole-advertising-1201774658/">many of the shows have the same blatant commercialization that led to the rise of the E/I rules they play to in the first place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, except for teenage audiences, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">making the blatant sponsorships and longer commercial breaks perfectly acceptable by the FCC's standards</a>.

Occasionally Steve Rotfeld Productions' Xploration Station block mostly seen of Fox stations gets lumped in, but isn't hated as much due to its STEM focus being seen as more interesting (plus it killed off a two-hour block of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infomercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infomercial">Infomercials</a> so it was a much worthier replacement to both viewers and Fox affiliates).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OkaasanToIssho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OkaasanToIssho">Okaasan to Issho</a></em> gets this due to it being aimed towards preschoolers and infants. It, however, does have some viewers who fondly grew up with one of its past incarnations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> was the bane of parents back when it premiered because of the puppets falling into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> territory and due to the lack of merchandise based on the toys in the shop, who were the most popular characters among children. It also got this from fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">Noddy's Toyland Adventures</a></em> because the segments used were split in half and most of the show focused on the new live action characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OutOfJimmysHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OutOfJimmysHead">Out of Jimmy's Head</a></em> was on the receiving end of this, even before it released. The complaints were that it was extremely cheap, based on an <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReAnimated">already panned TV movie</a> and to be Cartoon Network's shameful attempt at cashing in on Nickelodeon and Disney Channel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidCom">Kid Coms</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl (2015)</a></em> is hated by most detractors of feminism. They accuse the series of having "Social Justice Warrior" ideology and privileging female characters over male characters. Ironically the show has also gotten hate from "Social Justice Warrior"-types too, due to the questionable treatment of the non-white cast (African-American James Olsen being demoted from Love Interest in the first season to barely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">Advertised Extra</a> by the second, and casting a tanned-but-actually-white actress as someone coded Latina), the casting of far-right fundamentalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSorbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSorbo">Kevin Sorbo</a>, for whether its actually <em>good</em> at its intended feminist messages (due to the main character being overshadowed by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> boyfriend in the second season, and its stance on certain topics that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> among different feminist groups), and ultimately the feeling the show is more preformative than anything, merely trying to earn 'points' for being progressive without really doing anything progressive. A similar complaint is held towards its sister shows <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, which have similarly earned praise for diversity, but came under scrutiny for how they actually treat its 'diverse' audience.
</li><li> Shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DuckDynasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DuckDynasty">Duck Dynasty</a></em> that have/had a high appeal to the white rural demographic are/were predictably hated by the cool urban hipster audiences that rarely deign to watch them much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOriginals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOriginals">The Originals</a></em> spinoff <em>Legacies</em> is hated by fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> for getting picked up over potential spin-off <em>Wayward Sisters</em> and taking its timeslot.
</li><li> Preschool series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Boohbah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Boohbah">Boohbah</a></em> has a sizable hatedom of teens and adults, likely due to it being considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">surreal</a> to the point of it making almost no sense at all, with some going so far as to say that children can't learn anything from it (its intended purpose is to get children to exercise, but we don't know how many children in the target audience knew this and actually bothered to do the exercises with the Boohbahs). That, and some consider it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, particularly in regards to the Boohbahs themselves, which are five odd-looking brightly-colored creatures that do nothing of note but exercise and make farting sounds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore">Jersey Shore</a></em> was hated by <strong>all</strong> Italians, blacks, Cubans, anti-racist groups, Latinos, people living in the state of Jersey and feminists. The reason? The whole show (including possibly it's creators from MTV) is <em>racist</em> towards the first three listed!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldType">The Bold Type</a></em> has a massive hatedom among evangelicals because it airs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Freeform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Freeform">Freeform</a> (formerly Pat Robertson's Family Network), it is easily one of the network's most overtly liberal and feminist shows, and the evangelicals see it as emblematic of the network's betrayal of Robertson's ideals.
</li><li> Speaking of which, Pat Robertson and his show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The700Club" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The700Club">The 700 Club</a></em> are universally despised by fans of virtually every other show on Freeform, which are considered the antithesis to everything Robertson stands for. The idea is that the continuing platforming of Robertson undercuts every progressive message their other shows are trying to promote. Fans do tend to take pride in the fact that network executives hate Robertson just as much as they do and have been trying to get rid of him for years.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">older fans</a> of animated programming on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> have nothing but unbridled hatred for those networks' live-action content, at least starting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>. They are widely seen as generic, commercialized, and cringeworthy shows that promote bad life lessons to kids. Furthermore, fans of both networks feel that the mass production of these live action shows take away resources that could be used to produce more animated shows. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> had a similar problem when the CN Real block was on; however, the network seems to have realized their mistakes and CN Real died a quick death shortly afterwards.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boy bands</a> in general. It is well-known that many of these bands are manufactured more for looks than for sound. It doesn't help that they traditionally don't write their own music and often have only vocalists in their official line-up, which costs them respect even with fans of the pop genre.
<ul><li> This attitude goes back a long way. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ">Johnnie Walker</a> was famously fired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> for the first time for his adamant refusal to play hits by the manufactured boy band of the day, The Bay City Rollers, on his prime-time show. Johnnie pointed out he only wanted to play quality music by <em>real</em> groups. The BBC disagreed with his stance that the presenter should be free to pick his own playlist and sacked him. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11iqzd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11iqzd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11iqzd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Johnnie Walker now presents a retrospective 1970's music show for the BBC. He has mellowed slightly, grudgingly agrees the Rollers are part of many people's 1970's memories, and has agreed to play the occasional Rollers track. He thinks one a year is a good compromise. </span>
</li><li> Hanson in particular, from the amount of bile it raised in the non-fan throat. Hanson wasn't even a boy band in the traditional sense, since they at least wrote their own songs and played the instruments themselves (as well as being actually, y'know, <em>related</em> to each other instead of being manufactured according to some kind of "next, we need a dark-haired Bad Boy" list). Yet because they consisted of photogenic young men who made poppy music, they were lumped in with the rest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackstreetBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackstreetBoys">Backstreet Boys</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">*NSYNC</a> were notable because they tried to reach for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> and were smacked down. Some people were even surprised to learn that these were different bands. To make things even more interesting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> (from *NSYNC) <em>did</em> gain success outside the usual boy-band demographic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a> has one, but it's not nearly as large as the other ones. This is mostly because of Justin Bieber's hatedom being so big that instead of moving on to 1D they continued to hate Bieber. This was largely out of fear that he might continue to prosper without them trying to pull him down and/or they gave 1D a free pass solely so they can wipe Bieber Fever off the face of the planet. The ploy worked big time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWanted">The Wanted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigTimeRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigTimeRush">Big Time Rush</a>, on the other hand, do not really have such hatedoms, as their fandoms aren't large enough to spawn one in the first place. Most of their haters are One Direction fans.
</li></ul></li><li> This was also true of the Motown girls' groups (e.g. The Supremes), doo-wop, and a dozen other genres. In the old days, even classical musicians were hired as much for their looks as for their talent. The problem is really that these boys are being picked <em>for girls to ogle</em>, which is a Bad Thing because if girls are ogling them, they're not ogling the young men who make up this particular Periphery Hatedom.
</li><li> Pop princesses, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>, <em>may</em> have moved out of this category if they managed to grow up with any grace or artistry. Christina Aguilera successfully transferred to other genres, but this resulted in her falling well out of the limelight, so her hatedom has died down a bit. Britney Spears started to die down, but then it flared back up again when Kevin Federline entered her life and the media debacle that surrounded that. She's calmed down since then, and is starting to gain a bit of respect again for moving on with her career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a>, another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a>, had one of the biggest music periphery hatedoms in a long time. The huge media coverage (including being the focal point of one of Funnyordie.com's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> pranks) didn't help. The hatred of Bieber became so widespread that about half of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> videos, even those unrelated to Bieber, have someone complaining about him in the comments. In addition, Bieber was ranked #1 on the "2014's Most Annoying Celebrities" list. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meQEM3nVmi8">While there are valid reasons to dislike him based on his actions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he has yet to do anything that really seems heinous enough to justify being voted among the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.thetoptens.com/most-evil-people-in-history/">top ten most evil people in history<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>. The problem is so bad that Justin Bieber's Wikipedia entry is one of the most vandalized pages on the site, so much that it's listed twice in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Most_vandalized_pages">Most Vandalized Pages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> list (though whether that was intentional or not is unclear) and listed as semi-protected on the French version of that list.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> has haters that think she is a soulless sellout. Then there are the people who think she's anti-feminist for singing stereotypical love songs and spending most of her time mooning over boys. She also gets bashed for portraying herself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue">Purity Sue</a> (which is especially ridiculous when you consider songs like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpBonfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpBonfire">Picture To Burn</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold">Better Than Revenge</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Sparks Fly</a>"). Though, this has lessened a little bit after she recorded a song for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> movie, singing about something different.
</li><li> Backlash against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco">Disco</a> during its heyday in the 70s was so great that there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco">a trope</a> named after this backlash. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Demolition_Night">Disco Demolition Night<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a famous example of contemporary hatred toward the genre.
<ul><li> Specifically targeted are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees">The Bee Gees</a>, who were the face of disco in the late 1970s. Many were celebrating in the early 1980s when their amazing hit streak of the late 1970s came to a sudden halt (after 1979's "Love You Inside Out"), but even though they no longer dominated the charts, the Bee Gees — always well-respected for their harmonies — continued to sell out concerts, its members (specifically, Barry Gibb) continued to write hit songs for other artists, and in time, their songs that hit during the peak of their popularity began to receive heavy airplay on oldies stations.
</li><li> One possible reason that disco continues to be intensely hated is that in one way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope">it managed to remain ubiquitous even after it died out</a>. By the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial">1970s nostalgia swept America in the mid-'90s</a>, disco had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularHistory">so inextricably identified with the decade that spawned it</a> that — for a while, at least — it effectively buried all other (usually more serious or "harder") pop music genres from that time period, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">punk rock</a> to prog rock to power pop to early metal. Genuine fans of '70s pop culture were not amused to see it reduced to a laughingstock by ignorant (and often younger) observers who naturally assumed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">the '70s had given rise to only one, extremely obnoxious style of music</a>.

His later position as a Christian conservative commentator did nothing to help this. In fact, Little Richard's "Long Tall Sally" was written to be a song that Pat Boone would never cover. It backfired.
</li><li> For a period, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton">Michael Bolton</a> received so much bashing that "<em>Kill Michael Bolton!</em>" jokes practically became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> of their own. And Ryan Stiles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoseLineIsItAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoseLineIsItAnyway">Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a></em> continued to relentlessly make Bolton jokes even after his popularity had waned. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OfficeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OfficeSpace">Office Space</a></em> can't have helped (Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die!).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles">The Wiggles</a> has a hatedom consisting of older children and adults, mostly because many of their songs are for younger children. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Some also find the idea of men spending time with children creepy</a> (before the new, young members, including one woman, replaced the old ones).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> gets this, for many reasons by many different demographics, but, specifically, by non-camp males because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">over-the-top</a> refusal to be "conventional". Despite frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">Pandering to the Base</a>, people wonder why she's not so widely celebrated outside her obvious target demographic. Of course, given the calculated way she behaves and dresses "non-conventionally", it's almost like she's trying for this sort of reaction.
</li><li> Rap music in general.
<ul><li> The genre tends to inspire a generational divide between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET">BET-watching</a> youth of its fans and their out-of-touch adult parents who take offense to its violent, misogynist themes, can't understand a word of the Ebonics-laden lyrics, and at worst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">are unsure if Rap is even music</a>. Rap is even the preferred punching bag of older Black leaders who accuse/scapegoat it for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical">promoting stereotypes</a> and instilling in its listeners distorted messages about Black culture. It also has a MASSIVE hatedom amongst fans of classic rock, mainly because it's effectively replaced most genres of rock aside from alt-rock among the masses these days.
</li><li> Time killed this when the original "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> Generation" (who were teens during the '80s and early '90s) turned into parents, though it's still an issue for the older teens and young adults who are the children of the Baby Boomers (who were teens during the '60s and '70s, before rap became mainstream).
</li><li> Reggaeton, being a derivative from rap and dancehall, also has got in Latin America a hatedom similar to the one towards rap, on the same demographics and for similar reasons. Although they also get fire from the heavy sexual content of several songs, which adds a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">Think of the Children!</a> type to the hatedom.
</li><li> There's a substantial rivalry between metal and rap, though it's mostly one sided, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">most rap fans are oblivious to it</a>. This comes mostly from metal fans believing metal should be the biggest genre in the charts, and blame the popularity of rap for stopping this. They will lament the glory days of Nu Metal, but forget it was just as much a fad as anything else. (Ironically, when metal was at the peak of its popularity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, it was in the incarnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a>, which most of these critics also despise.) In actual fact, many metal fans like rap music and vice versa.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrunkCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrunkCore">Crunk Core</a> has the most storied Periphery Hatedom of any genre.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidzBop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidzBop">Kidz Bop</a>, a series of covers of popular songs sung by little kids with more kid-appropriate lyrics. It is aimed at little kids, and universally despised and panned by everyone older than 10.
<ul><li> The hatedom can also be spanned from the fact that ads for Kidz Bop play literally <em>all the time</em> on networks like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.
</li><li> Musicspace gives the series surprisingly good reviews, but these are mostly parents who bought the CDs for their kids, plus the site is directly connected to its record label, Razor &amp; Tie. All other sites trash the series mercilessly.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebeccaBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebeccaBlack">Rebecca Black</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friday">Friday</a> are, in some ways, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> of 2011. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a>, as she still receives a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> kind of respect, while the hate for her music is channeled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter">into positive ways</a>, such as remixes and covers, and self-deprecating videos, such as one where she is visibly embarrassed while watching her "Friday" video. And <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzfQwXEqYaI">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Brock's Dub" parody. This, ironically, might be because unlike with Justin Bieber, Rebecca Black did not have much of a (non-ironic) fandom. Bieber's music was professionally produced and engineered to capture the hearts of teen and tween girls and it did just that, much to its hatedom's dismay (with "Baby" being the most viewed video on YouTube at one point). "Friday" was recorded by a vanity label and appealed to exactly <strong>nobody</strong>, consequently there was not as much of a backlash and the only "fandom" the song would ever get consisted of people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">laughing at how awful it was</a> and almost bonding over it in a way.
</li><li> As white-hot as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> were in the sixties, they weren't without their share of hatred. Some of it came from their target demographic, such as fans of other British Invasion groups such as Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five or American groups like Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons. But much of it was from older adults who found their music to be more flash-in-the-pan disposable pop, and particularly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> (lampshaded in Allan Sherman's novelty tune "Pop Hates The Beatles"). Hatred from the latter would reach a fever pitch after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> was quoted saying the Beatles were "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus">more popular than Christ</a>", prompting fundamentalist Christians to burn all Beatle memorabilia (Lennon would heavy-heartedly clarify, "I'm not saying we're <em>better</em> than Christ or <em>greater</em> than Christ. I'm just saying we're more popular.") But by the time the band had reached <em>Revolver</em> and <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>, though, showing that they were more than just "yeah yeah"s, even adults had to sit up and took notice, and they began to be seen as the musical pioneers they're known as today. The hatedom even wanted to define the at the time recent term <em>beatlemania</em> as a form of female hysteria in an attempt to show off that fangirls of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> had a psychiatric illness that must be treated. Psychiatrists noted this and gave some of those a psychiatric test. The result was, predictably, that they did not suffer from any mental problems whatsoever and the term was redefined to maintain that being a fangirl is normal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> is a pretty polarizing figure in Rock and Roll among blacks. Some are appreciative of the attention Elvis brought to the genre among the white community, creating openings for black artists. Others felt he had appropriated the genre to the detriment of black artists who had been doing it long before he did. Elvis gave credit many times to earlier black artists whose songs he covered (to a much greater degree than, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>), but it didn't help that some of his fans believed he actually invented Rock and Roll. Elvis was also hated by some whites for being "too black", making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination">Tragic Mulatto</a> of sorts. And then, there were Moral Guardians who also hated his sound in general  and the fact that he swiveled his hips during his performances.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryBelafonte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryBelafonte">Harry Belafonte</a> is a polarizing figure amongst fans of calypso music. Although he brought the music to the attention of an American audience, he's criticised for doing so by watering the music down and generally playing traditional songs, not competing in calypso tents, and crediting other people's songs to himself. However, Belafonte was in fact very respectful towards the musicians and the record company was mostly to blame for the credits issue. He did end up crediting them for his songs. He signed so many calypso artists to RCA that they started a Trinidad division, and he paid them well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion">Céline Dion</a> got a fair bit of this, principally due to the overexposure of her hit "My Heart Will Go On" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>, but as her profile has diminished in the ensuing years, so has the hate, and many of those who were once part of the hatedom have changed their ways and now appreciate her music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a>:
<ul><li> In general. Most people who claim to "hate" country seem to hold it entirely to many Southern stereotypes which are far from universal, and have probably never listened to actual mainstream country.
</li><li> Music made after the early 1990s, in the eyes of classic country fans and more specifically, purists. Major complaints include the sound and the artistry being little more than bad pop/adult contemporary/arena rock music that has little to no resemblance to country music made prior to the 1980s, and the newer artists getting favor while classic artists who continued to write, record and release new material — including but not limited to Merle Haggard, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a>, Loretta Lynn and dozens of others — began to be ignored by radio and ultimately, the mainstream media. Since rural America has gone from poor to rich, the shift is understandable but still disturbing to some. Meanwhile, younger fans frequently find the classic sounds and music recorded by such pioneers as Kitty Wells, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">Hank Williams</a>, Webb Pierce and others outdated, unrefined, unrelatable and unlistenable.
</li><li> Bro-country music has earned a <em>huge</em> hatedom from people who absolutely hate its generic lyrics about sex, tailgating and drinking (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColeSwindell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColeSwindell">Cole Swindell</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloridaGeorgiaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloridaGeorgiaLine">Florida Georgia Line</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LukeBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LukeBryan">Luke Bryan</a>, etc.), as well as certain modern country artists who eschew actual country production in favor of electronic beats and pure pop production (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SamHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SamHunt">Sam Hunt</a>). Female artists who have made songs that actually support bro-country stereotypes (RaeLynn, Maggie Rose) have also gotten trashing from bro-country haters as well. The hatedom gradually died down as bro-country fell out of favor.
</li></ul></li><li> In several countries, folkloric music, either from the own or from their neighboring countries, by people who are more into "mainstream" music (read: rock and pop). For example, at one time in Venezuela there is the trifecta hate from people of the capital and neighboring cities towards joropo (because of being perceived as backwards music from country simpletons, and for having been used as a filler during a period of obligatory 1:1 ratio of imported/local music), Zulian gaita (because of saturation of the airwaves on Christmas time and extreme regional thematic) and vallenato (because of its association with Colombian immigration, often stereotyped as criminals and violent bus drivers who like to play music in their vehicles on an ear-damaging volume).
<ul><li> Similarly, in Mexico "banda" music (a genre consisting of very loud brass instruments and percussions alongside some accordion) and "corridos" (like folk ballads but with the same loud brass and accordions, originally born during the Mexican Revolution, they used to tell stories about folk heroes or notable historic characters, but now focus mostly on narcos) are a divisive topic, as listening to them is associated with a very specific stereotype of low-income, poorly-educated people who think the *only* or best way to make money is the drug business, are usually alcoholics, way too conservative and ignorant (basically a mix between rednecks and hillbillies who want to become druglords). Therefore, those two genres are derided as trashy, uncultred crap by half the country, but especially by metal fans who seem to harbor an almost animalistic hatred for them. However, that music is *very* popular with the other half of the population so it is inescapable, particularly in the north, where radio stations that play banda/corridos and stations that play literally anything else are on a 1:1 ratio; and where ANY event, be it weddings, baptisms, house parties, etc WILL end up playing banda until unholy hours of the night at ear-destroying volumes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SouljaBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SouljaBoy">Soulja Boy</a> managed to get this from <em>three</em> demographics — Veteran rappers (most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceT">Ice-T</a>) and their fans who felt his simple "how to do a dance" raps were ruining the genre, anime fans who were horrified by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">terribly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">ill-informed</a> attempt to make a song about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicsRuleEverythingAroundMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicsRuleEverythingAroundMe">he was</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs">an anime fan himself</a>, and ironically, actual veterans. Why the last? A song called "Let's Be Real," wherein he brags about how he got rich with his DIY approach to music and says "Fuck all the army troops."
</li><li> The late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> used to gather quite some flak in his time, mainly due to the scandals he got into, for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchild</a> in general, and for just being around kids. Notably, the haters often overlap with those who hate Barney as well (as noted on the documents at Jihad.net). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">This has mostly died down since his passing</a>, but some people still have hate on him.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> genre is the pun of many jokes, except for certain bands like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Skillet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Skillet">Skillet</a>, even from Christians.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Metal</a> gets a lot of hate from multiple camps, such as those who consider it Satanic or those who stereotype it as loud, angry screaming and loud noise. Then there's the intergenre rivalry, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretenderDiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretenderDiss">"true" metal fans disdaining</a> both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a> groups and their fans, expressing outrage that this pop garbage dares to call itself "metal." What they apparently forget is that "heavy metal" was a term coined by the critics, not by the fans or the band members themselves, and it just became generally appropriated. Furthermore, bands such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Poison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Poison">Poison</a> are increasingly no longer thought of as metal anyway, now that more extreme bands have gone mainstream.
</li><li> Music in Brazil has hatedom from all sides. People who enjoy Rock (especially Heavy Metal) generally hate Brazilian music to the point of not considering it part of Brazilian culture, but just trash. People who enjoy Brazilian music generally hates Rock (especially Heavy Metal too) saying it's just people screaming and not singing. Also, they think people who enjoy Rock are just a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">nerds</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginityMakesYouStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginityMakesYouStupid">virgins</a>.

A major complaint lobbed at them is that they have so many songs that, instrumentally, are exactly the same as older songs from bands both they and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk">Pop Punk</a> fans grew up listening to and they didn't bother to credit the writers of those songs one bit, minus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran">Duran Duran</a> (which they weren't going to until their legal team advised them to, due to that song sounding like 'Hungry Like the Wolf', which makes it a bit confusing as to why they weren't advised to on some of their <em>other</em> songs). Their fanbase doesn't help whatsoever, as they either couldn't care less about differing opinions from their own and won't have any of it, will fire back hearsay about certain songs being cowritten by the band whose song it sounds like (when they weren't, as evidenced by the writing credits and the band's own history of cowriters disproving what they say), will tell you it doesn't matter because "there's only so many chords" (which doesn't make much sense because it's not just the chords that are the same in said songs, and if that were true, either no one would be making new music, or every song would sound exactly the same in every genre), won't care, or will say that they don't hear it. This can get people who check their songs out to see why people like them, and others who aren't fans of them, angry because the songs are so blatant in their similarities that to not hear it and not hear the similarities brings a big "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">what?</a>" to the minds of those who do. It's not just the instrumentals either. Others don't care for them because their lyrical writing style is too similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllTimeLow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllTimeLow">All Time Low</a>'s, some of their merch and CD designs are blatantly too close to other bands', they come off as a boyband thanks to their marketing, or the fact that they were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> cover band from Australia that only got as popular as they have thanks to them gaining a heavy following from One Direction's fanbase of tween and teenage girls thanks to One Direction bringing them on tour with them, which was a guarantee that they'd gain a substantial following (which some of their fans treat as more of a heartwarming story about them braving the world by going on tour when they hadn't even finished high school yet than it really is). Thus, their fame, to some, feels unearned and that they would've been better off spending several more years trying to get a recording contract rather than all of that, then starting their own record company, which they also release their own music under.

Many K-pop detractors are those who are simply sick of the genre's "stans", who are notorious for hijacking random posts on social media (including those announcing the deaths of beloved figures) to post footage of their favorite artists singing or dancing, using bots to artificially inflate sales and play numbers on websites like Last.fm and Spotify, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">overpraising</a> their favorite artists which detractors view as little more than boy bands and girl groups (who already are known for their massive hatedoms; see above) that aren't deserving of the hype.

<p><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> has such a colorful history of hatedom that it has its own section:
</p><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> franchise, even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Friendship is Magic</a></em>, being intentionally aimed at children, has a Periphery Hatedom; even <em>Friendship Is Magic</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> denies it.
</li><li> Bizarrely, the show has ended up with not one, but <em>three</em> periphery hatedoms:
<ul><li> The first is directed towards the show itself. This is the standard hatedom, primarily composed of people who do not watch the show and hate it on principle just because it's <em>My Little Pony</em>. Even in any age range, adults who never actually watched it, tend to hate and deride the show for being too boring (the same goes for every single iteration of the franchise and <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> is no exception).
</li><li> The second is targeted towards the show's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>. <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> is in a very strange situation where a show gains a hatedom because it's arguably <strong>better than expected</strong>. Its wild success led to the creation of a massive (and vocal) fandom of adults and hence an even harder pushback from the Hatedom, with people joining in on the hatred simply because they're sick of seeing the show brought up everywhere. With a vast fandom invariably come bad apples and even some "bronies" find themselves disapproving of some of the more... <em>questionable</em> things their fellow bronies do. Oh yeah, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">there's fanmade porn of the characters. Loads and loads of fanmade porn</a>. This is another significant factor contributing towards the hatred of the fandom, especially from the anti-furry community, who tend to lump all bronies together with furries.
</li><li> The final periphery hatedom just lumps it all into one basket, hating everything about both.
</li></ul></li><li> Before FiM and the bronies, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTales">My Little Pony Tales</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyG3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyG3">My Little Pony (G3)</a></em> had hatedom from fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends">My Little Pony 'n Friends</a></em> due to the genre switch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>. <strong>And then</strong> even fans of <em>My Little Pony Tales</em> usually <strong>despise</strong> <em>G3</em> due to its significant drop in animation quality and the plots becoming increasingly insipid and boring, even for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> <em>My Little Pony</em> show.
</li><li> Generation 3.5 is widely-hated by even the most hardcore fans. Particularly, the <em>Newborn Cuties</em> line is almost universally despised outside of the target audience, mainly because of its childish writing and how the creatures that are supposed to be baby ponies look nothing like their namesake<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13bw3j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13bw3j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13bw3j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Newborn Cuties range are part of G3.5</span>. Bad enough that G3.5 gathered flak among pony collectors for not looking like ponies, the Newborn Cuties somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">managed to take it several notches higher</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonCreature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonCreature">Cartoon Creature</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> range.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em> got an awful lot of flack from bronies before it even came out, simply because it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU">High School A.U.</a> When it came out, it created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> of the millennium over if it was good or not. It also got flack from parents because what used to be an innocent property for young girls was being changed into a hip, sexier line of teenage dolls, not unlike what happened years earlier with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DorasExplorerGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DorasExplorerGirls">Dora's Explorer Girls</a></em>.
</li><li> When the first teaser for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017">My Little Pony: The Movie</a></em> was released on Movie Clips, there was basically a 50/50 split down the middle in terms of likes and dislikes. A quick glance into the comment section reveals an overwhelming sense of apathy.

The huge backlash eventually led to it being canceled after one season as part of the network's continual executive foot-shooting to keep up with Disney.

Nevertheless it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">lasted over twenty years</a>.
</li><li> Of Nickelodeon shows, 2013's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NickStudio10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NickStudio10">Nick Studio 10</a></em> received an irrational hatedom because of its un-traditional interruptions of programming (right in the middle of episodes with random videos that had no rhyme or reason, although the block was mainly made up of the usual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> marathons the network has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">become addicted to</a>, so unless you're completely new to the show, you knew what was happening anyways), stunts and skits which wasted food, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">Toilet Humour</a>, and some rather overheated accusations of animal abuse, though the actual audience either enjoyed it or rolled their eyes and waited them out because they were there to watch a show, not the continuity between. It may have developed into a sane block eventually, but a hacking of the show's Twitter account with racist content, social media harassment of the cast, YouTube videos criticizing it made by viewers well out of their demographic (The Archfiend was the most infamous hater of the block and was in his <strong>thirties</strong>), and the show's Facebook moderator just giving up made it too onerous for Nickelodeon to continue it. After a Labor Day 'best-of' episode promising the return of the block, the block never returned and the cast moved onto projects outside the network, and who could blame them? As of 2016, Nick has not launched any other live hosted blocks, likely scared off completely by the <em>Studio 10</em> experience.
</li><li> NickMom started out as a new block on the Nick Jr. channel in 2012 centered on mom-focused humor and such to give them a respite after having to tolerate their toddler's continuous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig">Peppa Pig</a></em> obsession. To social media critics who don't understand that a new network's first schedule will never become permanent, it was like <em>Franklin</em>, <em>Dora</em>, and <em>Blue's Clues</em> were taken out back and shot, replaced by inappropriate mom-focused humor despite multiple content warnings. Adding to the hatedom were several minor controversies, such as having an insensitive blog post about those affected by Hurricane Sandy, using photos of children without permission on their blog, and airing a skit titled "Bake Sale" which caused outrage among parents who felt the skit was mocking children with food allergies, successfully managing to get it pulled from both the block and its website (you can watch it <a class="urllink" href="http://vimeo.com/37078192">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and judge for yourself.) The ratings (low as they were), however, eventually sorted things out; the funny stuff and movie reruns worked, the vulgar stuff didn't, and by 2014 NickMom became more benign (with only the occasional sex joke or edited R-rated romance movie here and there), with Disney Junior, Sprout, and Netflix easily happy to take the homes that don't want to watch NickMom. Eventually, though, those who were still dissatisfied with the block won; the block was discontinued to the relief of its (by then mostly faded) hatedom on September 28, 2015 (and by then if you wanted to take down 90's romance films and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Parenthood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Parenthood">Parenthood</a></em> reruns, you just looked petty), with regular Nick Jr. programs taking its place.

</li><li> Initially, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig">Sanjay and Craig</a></em> was accused by many people for being a rip-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> and upon premiering was berated for having too much toilet humor. (The first episode was notably about a <em>butt transplant</em>) Even before it premiered, it was hated for <em>actually interrupting shows</em> ala the aforementioned <em>Nick Studio 10</em> to show promos for it. However, the show eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">grew the beard</a> and gradually gained a noticeable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> over time. People were even disappointed when it was cancelled. Many of the first season's episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">are now mostly seen as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a>. (Though some episodes, particularly the infamous and nonsensical "Fart Baby" episode are still widely disliked.) It still has a number of detractors, though, so it's not completely an aversion to this trope.

<ul><li> A large number of people, mainly people who do not have children of their own, despise the show because they find the show's opening theme off-putting. The hatred for the theme song is so immense, that <a class="urllink" href="https://imdb.com/poll/MINg0eeE5Gs/results">it is ranked third place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in an IMDB user poll about songs from movies and TV that people despise, only beaten by "I Love You" from <em>Barney and Friends</em> and "My Heart Will Go On" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>, with 152 votes being cast against it.

<ul><li> Professional wrestling in general gets this from those that understand that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">choreographed</a>, but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel">why this is the case</a>. The hatedom is significant enough that the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes">Useful Notes</a> page for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> is dedicated to addressing and debunking the myths that come from it.
</li><li> Old school WWE fans (and many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a> fans) seem to particularly loathe the character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hornswoggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hornswoggle">Hornswoggle</a>, whose matches border on slapstick comedy and seem to exist for the sole reason of attracting the attention of small children. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatKhali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatKhali">The Great Khali</a> is a similar example.
</li><li> Characters regarded as overbooked supermen, primary and most controversial example being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> are examples as well.
</li><li> Many male fans find the Divas' matches boring. Well, unless you're at the event, you don't have to watch them — and even if you are, you could just go to the bathroom or get a hot dog. The arguments tend to stem from: the matches are too badly fought to entertain "purists", and the girls aren't slutty enough to drag in the "letches", so they usually end up in the "meh" zone.
</li><li> Purists resent the fact the WWE has no real interest in making a legitimate female division, and find the current iteration of the Diva division to be reeking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>. That and the fact they insist on hiring models instead of athletes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> has started to get the same complaints as well. There are also disenfranchised Diva fans who remember its short Golden Age in the early 2000s, when the Divas started to get serious about wrestling, starting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>.
</li><li> A different set of purists who will hold a former model's past career against her even if she becomes a good wrestler. Others will get this even when they've never done modelling before. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> herself experienced this early on and had to start taking chair shots to shake off the haters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly">Kelly Kelly</a> is an example as many people will read her name in a match and automatically label it as bad without even bothering to watch it. A lot of this might be due to the perception that the female championship has been cheapened since 2007 by putting it on a revolving door of Divas instead of having mainstays like it once did. There's also the argument that certain Divas get much more attention than they deserve, at the expense of Divas who are at least as good. Take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson">Torrie Wilson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackieGayda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackieGayda">Jackie Gayda</a>, for instance. They weren't the best in the ring, but they at least entered WWE with <em>some</em> wrestling experience. Yet they barely got near the Women's Championship, much less won it, and all too quickly saw their careers slide into irrelevance. Considering that, how fair is it that Kelly Kelly comes to WWE with <em>no</em> wrestling experience and gradually takes over the entire division, much like Trish had a few years before?
<ul><li> More recently there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie">Eva Marie</a>, who is not unpopular with fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> but reviled by actual wrestling fans. Eva Marie made it no secret on social media that she was more interested in launching an acting career than learning to wrestle, combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">taking a liking to her</a> and wanting to push her to the moon before she'd even learned to wrestle made her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a> among wrestling fans. WWE tried to fix things by rebranding her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice-heavy</a> character who kept having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunctions</a>, preventing her from actually wrestling, but fans still hated her.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there are those — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> types, mostly — who are annoyed at the fact that women's wrestling exists at all, asserting that the only thing girls should be doing in the ring is holding up the round cards (which hasn't happened since wrestling made pains to distinguish itself from boxing) and deriding female wrestling as "just more modern/revisionist/politically correct crap of the '90s", etc. — apparently not realizing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">there have been female professional wrestlers (1930s) for almost as long as there has been professional wrestling itself (1920s, at least in the form we are familiar with today)</a>. The fact that WWE did not heavily promote its women's division until the late 1990s — and even then mostly for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> — may have contributed to this attitude, especially among men who were only casual wrestling fans.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Sports </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Golf. From those who aren't fans, it's regarded as monotonous, luck-based, aristocratic, unathletic (since some people just drive carts to wherever the ball is instead of walking), and associated with square old rich people in clown pants. Even if you don't use a cart, it's widely not considered to be particularly "athletic". Dave Barry once discussed it by breaking down the calories burned into various categories like "sauntering," "squinting," and "saying things like 'You certainly did double bogey that mashie niblick, Ted! Ha ha!'" For ironic points, in order to combat the idea that golf isn't athletic, there are rules regarding the use of carts on the pro-circuit, mainly that unless you can prove beyond reasonable doubt (seriously, you jump though a ridiculous amount of hoops) you can't walk the distance involved, you walk the course. This leads to many people, who happen to catch a few minutes of golf on TV, to question why the players don't just ride in the carts to help speed the slow game up. Its image as the pastime of the classist, privileged elite (despite the highly contrarian face of the sport, Tiger Woods) certainly does not help matters.
</li><li> Sailing. It's viewed as a very upper-class activity, due to the cost of owning and maintaining a boat, as well as associating "sailing" with cruise ship vacations, even though the two are nothing alike.
</li><li> Equestrian sports. Like sailing, they're generally perceived as elitist and upper class. In the case of actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a> (who was permanently paralyzed after falling off a horse), the hatred got so intense that some people annoyed by his activism on the part of the handicapped implied that Reeve <em>deserved</em> to have it happen to him.
</li><li> Cricket, especially as it takes day to complete what is called a "test match". In the reverse though, the faster 20Twenty variant that intends to make the game relevant for the Internet generation is cited by traditional cricket fans as the sullying of the sport.
</li><li> Motor sports in general. They are perceived as boorish, lower class, anti-intellectual sports which are dangerous, waste fuel, and pollute the environment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>, for detracting the athletic element from sports for part of it; and its common association with rednecks for the other. Others simply find it boring, since at bottom it's just a cluster of fancy cars driving around and around for hours — really not much more than what you'll see on a particularly busy freeway system.
</li><li> Cardio kickboxing is one of the biggest crazes among fitness aficionados and shows no sign of dying down, but it continues to get a lot of hate from formal practitioners of martial arts for diluting the practice. While many pioneers of the craze, such as Billy Blanks and Chalene Johnson, <em>are</em> in fact, legitimate martial artists, the fact that people started becoming instructors with no formal background means they risk teaching bad form to students that not only distracts them from effective fighting techniques should they ever need to defend themselves, but actually runs the risk of students <em>hurting</em> themselves doing the moves as exercise.
</li><li> <em>Competitive</em> kickboxing has gotten hatred from some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>. The most common accusations is that it has stripped martial arts of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">once-typical hallmark of restraint and peaceful ideals</a>, and turned the whole ordeal into a spectator sport dedicated to feeding the audience's love for violence. John McCain called it "human cockfighting." However, again, the opposition has done little to dampen the enthusiasm of its fans.
</li><li> Sumo wrestling; usually because it epitomizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay">Manly Gay</a> to some people, and to others because it inspires a lot of "fat-men-in-diapers" jokes. If you see any depiction of this sport outside Japan, it is likely to be parodic in nature.
</li><li> Cheerleading, due to the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader">negative stereotypes associated with cheerleaders</a> and because it is a stereotypically female sport (a criticism often raised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">feminists</a>, ironically enough). Many will even deny that it <em>is</em> a sport, when in fact it requires mastery of a great many physical challenges and is actually more dangerous than most of the "jockier" sports.
</li><li> The NBA attracts its fair share of hatedom from "purists" or old school fans who feel the league has been over-commercialized or because of the lower scoring of this era, over-emphatic on defense, hockey fans who feel the media focuses too heavily on basketball at the expense of their favorite sport, and racists who find the NBA to be a convenient way to side-vent their prejudices (if the person uses the word "thug" or any variation in describing why they don't like the NBA, they usually fall under the last category).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a>, which is perceived as violent, dangerous and lionizing negative masculine stereotypes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a> has this much more strongly than ice hockey; although the rules of American football do forbid fighting more strongly than ice hockey (in football, brawling causes an automatic ejection; in ice hockey, the punishment is five minutes in the penalty box), in football, the violence is baked right into the way the game is played. Tackling, blocking, and hitting the opponent with one's body, often at fairly high speed, is an essential part of playing football. Moreover, one of the best "weapons" a football player has is none other than his own helmeted head—which has led to a massive problem with concussions and sub-concussion brain damage that causes lasting neurological problems. This often goes hand-in-hand with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">negative perceptions</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">American culture</a>. Many of these stereotypes seem to be held by people who aren't aware that football has moved beyond "three yards and a cloud of dust" and is much more based on complex strategy and physical finesse these days.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">Collegiate American Football</a> (and college sports in general) gets knocked for having nothing to do with the mission of a school and wasting money that could be used for education (which are valid criticisms, but also very ignorant of how the functions of higher education in America evolved and the complexities of how institutions spend and acquire money).
</li><li> Association Football (soccer for Americans), because of a reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans">violent, riot-happy fans</a> (despite American Football fans also destroying their own cities when they win the Super Bowl) and whiny, injury-faking players. Soccer also gets a lot of hate from fans (or proponents) of other sports in countries where it (soccer) is dominant, this ironically mirrors the attitude many US soccer fans have towards the "big four" (Baseball, Basketball, Hockey and American Football). Of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">it does</a> take away (usually limited) media attention and more crucially television money from other sports such as Handball.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em> itself gets a lot of hate from the Euro-gamer and "serious" board-gamer crowd. There are also some, both left-wing and right-wing, who know the original game was intended as a scathing satire on capitalism (though it was really only accurate to the late-19th century, pre-antitrust Robber Baron era). Right-wingers don't like it for having been a leftist caricature of a market economy and leftists don't like that it's now one of the biggest mass-marketed corporate products <em>ever</em>. The political hatedoms are especially odd because Monopoly was not intended to be a critique of the free market at all (which arguably didn't even exist in its present form when the game was created), but of the old protectionist and consolidationist economic model that is despised by left-wingers and (most) right-wingers alike. Meanwhile, board-gamers don't like it because hardly anyone actually plays it by the real rules, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a>" generally tend to drag out the game past the point where it stops being fun. That's bad enough, but it's also so ubiquitous that board-gamers (with some justification) fear anyone hearing "board game" is likely to first think "Monopoly" and then "I'd rather have root canal without anesthetics." Not helping is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro">Hasbro</a> has found it to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a> and churns out dozens and dozens of themed Monopoly games, including ones based on franchises mentioned here...

(Like the doll itself is the sole cause in the first place, as lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BabyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BabyBlues">Baby Blues</a></em>.) Ask around the Internet and you'll probably find a lot of people, even girls (especially girls), who decapitated and mutilated Barbie dolls when they were little. Barbie <em>is</em> a stereotype of what a woman is supposed to be. Just a different stereotype: specifically, some kind of blonde, tanned, superwoman.
</li><li> If you were a boy and played with a Barbie doll, then you immediately had to transfer schools. Unless, that is, you did stuff like strap her to a model rocket and attempted to launch her into outer space or did all sorts of violent acts to her such as dropping a bowling ball on her or trying to melt her with a magnifying glass.
</li><li> Poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel">Mattel</a>. It seems that no matter what they do with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie">Barbie</a> franchise, they'll end up getting flak for it. One scheme in giving Barbie a positive light is <em>Hello Barbie</em>, a doll that could do advanced speech recognition and speech synthesis to answer questions posed to her by the owner and connect to Mattel's server (for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> filtering) over the Internet via Wi-Fi to get information. The intention here is to show that girls can be smart, allowing a child to look to Barbie for help with homework if no one else who can help is around. It immediately gathered flak for being a <em>privacy invader</em> (despite Mattel assuring that no personally identifiable information on the owner will be stored on their server, and only certain non-critical information like the owner's name is stored in the doll itself) and white hats immediately started pointing out how the doll can be hacked to say things of their choice, not by hacking the doll itself, <em>but by hijacking the ISP's domain name server</em> (which will allow them to take over <em>any</em> Internet connected program, including the humble web browser, and that's assuming they managed to reverse engineer the doll's communications protocol first). Nevermind that Microsoft, Blackberry, Apple and Google have done this with Cortana, Assistant, Siri and Google Assistant respectively with no backlash whatsoever, and that toys like that are pretty common in Japan and had not have any issues in that country. And hobbyists all over the world, including in the US itself, have been hacking up dolls that do just that, <em>and those have no filtering whatsoever</em>. The fact that certain TV shows were hyping up the paranoia wasn't helping. And when they put that same technology into a different toy (a Fisher-Price stuffed bear), <em>the first batch of said toy sold out within days of launch</em>. It seems that the real problem here isn't about privacy or protecting little girls, but <em>Barbie can't be smart</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bratz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bratz">Bratz</a></em> doll line received lots of complaints. Like Barbie, a lot of them were from people concerned about its target demographic of little girls, and even more so given the Bratz dolls' revealing clothes and thick make-upped expressions. However, there were, once again, a lot of boys (and older or tomboyish girls) who just liked making fun of things little girls liked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MonsterHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MonsterHigh">Monster High</a></em> has this reputation but mainly because of how its popularity has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">affected other series</a>. Many copycats such as <em>DC Super Hero Girls</em> and Disney's <em>Descendants</em> riff off the formula. This leads to scorn from older fans in the respective fanbases, which ends up redirected as <em>Monster High</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FunkoPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FunkoPop">Funko Pop!</a></em> is very popular, but it has an extremely vocal hatedom online.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> has gotten this treatment for decades from three different sides.

On the other side you have very few people who hate it for being too cutesy. Then there's those who're in to colorful horses, but have defected and declared hate on G3.5 onwards due to those not looking anything like horses. Incidentally, those who decried G3.5 onwards defected to Simba Toy's <em>Filly</em> line, who're now at war with the bronies because some of the latter lashed out at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FillyFuntasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FillyFuntasia">Filly Funtasia</a></em>.

Many fans were stumped on why anyone would want to play an <em>Animal Crossing</em> game without the main aspects; however, there is a market out there for designer games. Despite the heavy criticism, it sold quite well in Japan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> has fans who take every opportunity to bash the Shu Kingdom for not really being as heroic as the early games made them out to be. This hate comes from people who read the actual history surrounding the Three Kingdoms Era and realized that Shu and their officers were bloody, violent, less than scrupulous people who got their fame boosted by the novel. Unfortunately, those same people miss the point that both Romance of the Three Kingdoms and, subsequently, Dynasty Warriors are NOT based off of the actual Chinese history, but rather the books themselves. It's not going to feature Sun Jian historically slay Hua Xiong, because in the NOVEL, it was Guan Yu.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> has been getting this from some more jaded gamers, especially via its newer games.

The games are very anime-styled and seem to be targeted towards the older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a> demographic, but get some hate from fans outside said demographic (including fans of Nintendo's more family-friendly series such as <em>Mario</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>) for their anime cliches, controversial subjects and features (including the ability to marry characters in-game), and <em>Fire Emblem</em>'s allegedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">disproportionate amount of representation</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros.

</li><li> <em>Awakening</em> and <em>Fates</em> also invert this in another way: they are generally beloved by mainstream gamers and critics and often considered some of the best 3DS games of all time. Their reception among the core <em>Fire Emblem</em> fanbase, however, is much more contentious.

While there are indeed contentious aspects to her such as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a> and being frequently depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">Moveset Clone</a>, many of these haters arbitrarily treat such elements as if they make her into the worst character ever, and bemoan how her popularity allegedly made <em>Fire Emblem</em> (and to a lesser extent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>) all about "waifus".

Many gamers kill him as a response. In response to much of the hate to the character, Riot Games has counted how many times Teemo has been killed by players per second.
<ul><li> <em>League of Legends</em> itself gets a lot of hate from non-MMO fans, though largely because of its community.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders">Skylanders</a></em> is a very notorious case.

<ul><li> Some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> will complain about every other fighting game that exists. If it is a 2D one, they'll blame it for being a clone. If it is a 3D one, they will blame it for being a 'button masher'. It's gotten to the point where games that are much more complex than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> are looked down on by fans. The truth is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> comes into play. In later years, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> has become this, with every new incarnation of Tekken or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">SoulCalibur</a></em> being compared unfavorably to it despite being largely different in gameplay.
</li><li> A local example (in Brazil) happened when Laura was announced for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, mainly because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">revealing clothes</a>. Some people complained about Capcom over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy">exaggerating Brazilian stereotypes again</a> (it can't be helped by the fact Laura is from Rio de Janeiro, a well known city for illegal sex tourism). This only worsened when Laura got more revealing clothes which made some people accusing Capcom of damaging the image of Brazilian woman. The hatedom towards Laura dissolved some time after.

<ul><li> The franchise as a whole got plenty of this during the initial craze's heyday, and you'd still be hard-pressed to find an enthusiastic fan who wasn't a preteen or younger when it first came out. Also, some fans of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">earliest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">games</a>, known as GENWUNNERS<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18pvrl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18pvrl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18pvrl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">after the GEEWUNNERS in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> fandom, below</span>, can have this towards some incarnations of the game. Chalk it up to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19rps5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19rps5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19rps5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">considering how glitch-ridden the original games were — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Good Bad Bugs</a> had the side effect of making an easy game mind-numbingly easier for adult players</span> and this trope, from aging out of the intended demographic. While the games have more universal appeal than, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic">the anime</a>, they're still made primarily with kids in mind, although from 2013 onwards the franchise has been reinventing itself as an "all-ages" franchise similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> itself rather than a franchise mostly for young children. Even so, the franchise still gets this from time to time, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater">adult fans are mocked for enjoying the franchise</a> (even if it's through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em>, which is well-known for being a mainstream success and more directly tailored to adult smartphone users).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> are frequently accused of having spawned the "genwunner" phenomenon, a strong example of a Periphery Hatedom for the newer games. While the games were highly praised by fans and critics, they also completely displaced older Pokémon by introducing a self-contained ecosystem of 156 brand-new species. Many adults who grew up with the older games took issue and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">compared them negatively to Gen I and II Pokémon</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> levels. Seeing this reaction, Game Freak deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">catered to fans</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">of the classic 'mons</a> in subsequent games, and saw an excuse to print even more money. However, this in turn later caused the cycle to begin anew (albeit on a smaller scale), with fans of <em>BW</em> (now adults in their own right) venting their spite towards later games for abandoning the new direction that was promised in <em>BW</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">essentially becoming just like the "genwunners" of old</a>.
</li><li> Within the franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot">Series Mascot</a> Pikachu is probably the most infamous example, due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> tendencies, the number of electric-typed rodents that try to emulate Pikachu's popularity (known as "Pika-clones" by the fandom), and its strong association with the anime (which has its own entry on this page); in fact, it was one of the most frequent targets of mockery in early <em>Pokémon</em> parodies.
</li><li> As with the anime, <em>Pokémon</em> is an enormously famous and popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Sacred Cow</a> among millennials, Gen Z, and their children, who collectively make up the series' target demographic. However, since its inception, it has been hated, mocked and/or dismissed by baby boomers, who continue to see it as a childish, shallow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> franchise with no broader appeal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> gets this reaction from a small number of game reviewers and fans of other Nintendo series, due to the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">Tastes Like Diabetes</a> aesthetic (the frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> notwithstanding) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">the easiness of the games</a> in order to make them accessible to small children.
</li><li> Examples related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Mario</em> franchise, normally one of Nintendo's biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Sacred Cows</a> for being its "mascot" franchise, can experience some hatred from older fans when it goes through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. A strong example was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> era from 2012 to 2016, where the games showed stereotypical signs of pandering to children and casual players,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20aek2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20aek2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20aek2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the games becoming shallower, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">more repetitive</a> and less innovative, the franchise's typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plots</a> becoming even stronger than before, a general vibe of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">Tastes Like Diabetes</a></span>; some games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a></em>, have a very pronounced hatebase of older gamers. Such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Ages</a> can also make <em>Mario</em>'s typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a> more embarrassing for Nintendo fans, especially fans of other franchises. However, this is technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>; the <em>Mario</em> games are targeted towards all ages (moreso than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>), placing the hatedom in the <em>Mario</em>'s <strong>intended</strong> demographic of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal">everyone</a>".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21j28z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21j28z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21j28z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, it's placement on this page is a very contentious manner, as it's debated on if it fits under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> or a Periphery Hatedom.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> as a whole, as well as <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other similar series, get this treatment from fans of "dark and edgy" series such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>, who dismiss Nintendo's series as being too silly and optimistic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">But these fans are often kids themselves</a>, in the mature series' own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, who complain about things that they perceive as "babyish" because they think it's cool.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s "Play Nintendo" marketing branch, aimed at children, is disliked by some older fans for being overly quirky and kid-focused (even coming across as <em>condescending</em> in some cases) and for taking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> franchise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. However, this does not affect the content of the games themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoMirageSessionsFE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoMirageSessionsFE">Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE</a></em> is on the receiving end of this trope from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> fandom for being too "anime". To them, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> was pushing it but this one crossed the line. The fact that the game's plot revolves around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> business is an aggravating factor, as the business is widely despised by people in the West, even anime fans. This also heavily contrasts <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4DancingAllNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4DancingAllNight">Persona 4: Dancing All Night</a></em>'s deconstruction of the idol business by showing just how horrible and unfair it is to the idols, which didn't help with the <em>Persona 4</em> fans who weren't alienated.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">Fandom Rivalry</a> between the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> entries qualifies for this trope. While the games are primarily for casual, friendly play, they also have a sizable fanbase of competitive players, especially for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Melee</a></em>. A sector of the <em>Melee</em> fanbase vocally derides other <em>Smash</em> entries for being too casual-friendly and not as exciting to watch competitively as their favored game.
</li><li> <em>Microsoft <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDMovieMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDMovieMaker">3D Movie Maker</a></em> has McZee, a weird blue guy who really wants to be Barney-but-wackier. He's pretty horrible, and the exclusion of him as a posable character is about the only reason the first four thousand fan-made movies weren't all "McZee dies in horrible ways".
</li><li> The Nintendo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>. Once Nintendo finally did what they had promised to do and expanded console video games outside the 18-24 Affluent Male market, said market declared them the anti-Christ. Even Nintendo's continued development of "traditional" games<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22ql98');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22ql98" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22ql98');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> which continue to far outnumber their "expanded market" titles</span> hasn't silenced the hatedom one bit. Of course, the rest of the market seems not to have noticed (much to the chagrin of the 18-24 Affluent one). Among the platform's games, the worst sufferers of this were of course the "expanded market" games themselves: Nintendo's "Wii Series" games directed towards non-gamers such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSports">Wii Sports</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiFit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiFit">Wii Fit</a></em>, and others. During the late 2000s, they were a gigantic fad that outsold and were played more than most other games by a huge margin, causing the 18-24 Affluent Male market to declare gaming ruined and fear for its senior-citizen-and-soccer-mom-ruled future. However, as the fad has died, so has the hate.
<ul><li> The market, however, did eventually notice when Nintendo attempted a successor, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a>. Despite on paper being a logical successor to the Wii, having the same drawbacks in its own generation that the Wii did (minimal online support, reduced third party support, weak graphics in comparison to the competition, difficulty to port games to the console due to its drawbacks), it crashed and burned so hard that Nintendo was forced to create an entire new console for the same console generation, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>. As Nintendo had lost the hardcore gaming market with the Wii, they were reliant on their new primary market to purchase the Wii U in order for it to succeed. Not being traditional gamers, they didn't follow the behavior patters of traditional gamers and buy out of brand loyalty or seeking to be able to play sequels to their favorite exclusive franchises, as gaming culture promotes buying the "new hot thing". Ironically, Nintendo should have known about this problem, as back in the 90s they had to take steps both to prevent people from calling other consoles "nintendos" and to make sure people understood what the SNES was due to parents (the primary purchasers of video game consoles at the time) not immediately understanding the idea of a new console from the same developer. One of the immediate problems the Wii U faced upon debut? People not understanding it was a new system and not just some sort of updated Wii.
</li></ul></li><li> Axl from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series is a bit of an odd case. While he's despised by the series' main fanbase, the small but dedicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> of young women just can't seem to resist his boyish charm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyMysticQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyMysticQuest">Final Fantasy Mystic Quest</a></em> tends to attract hatred from people who believe the urban legend that it was why the USA didn't get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> (or why Europe didn't get <em>any</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> game) until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> years, as well as the fact that it was actually made specifically to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatewaySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatewaySeries">introduce people to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>. However, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> game, it <em>does</em> have a fanbase thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>, as well as how some people actually <em>did</em> play that game as an introduction to the RPG-genre.
</li><li> If the marketing is anything to go by, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a> are intended for kids that want toys of Nintendo characters. However there is a hatedom for amiibo by two groups: Those who think that they are overly-expensive dolled-up physical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a>, most notably with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em> amiibo, and those who think that amiibo has way too much focus on stocking the kid-friendly characters, especially from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, and forgetting the franchises that skew more towards Nintendo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> or are outright intended for mature audiences (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>).
</li><li> Any of the big console shooter franchises draw plenty of flak from players who dislike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">FPSes</a>, PC gamers, and fans of older styles of shooters. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series may be the most common victims, but they are not alone. First-person shooters are also frequent scapegoats of people who hold the assumption that their fandom of "cerebral" games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> somehow makes them more intelligent than the primates who play <em>Call of Duty</em>, et. al.
<ul><li> Which makes for a <em>very</em> strange inverted hatedom in retrospect, as until the past decade or so you basically <em>had</em> to have a PC if you wanted to play an FPS due to the limitations of the consoles of the day. Still, even modern consoles' limitationssuch as the ever-present gamepad vs. mouseare picked apart by PC gamers, sometimes deemed as reasons why FPS game design has been dumbed down since the mid-'00s.
</li><li> The major pet peeve was that on the side of the FPS crowd, they hated it for how it monopolized shooters into a single uniform genre with very little deviation (Iron Sights/Regenerating Health and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">Cutscene Incompetence</a>). For the others, they see the shooters as completely strangulating what creativity is left in the industry as game developers are crushed by publishers for not living up to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlagshipFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlagshipFranchise">Flagship Franchise</a> standards.
</li></ul></li><li> Overly popular and mainstream adult-oriented games — most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>, but also annualized sports games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em> and to a lesser extent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> — get this reaction from "geekier" and more dedicated gamers, who collectively label them as "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dudebro+Gamer">dudebro games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", criticize them for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a> and (for the action games) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">Rated M for Money</a>, claim that they cater to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23i36x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23i36x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23i36x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which is one reason <em>GTA</em> gets a bit more slack in this respect, as its games are considered to be very high-quality and unique</span>, and resent the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">their popularity and playerbase overshadows their preferred "nerdy" games many times over</a>. However, similar to the Nintendo example above, many of these haters technically fall within the 18-35 affluent demographic that the "dudebro" games are targeting, although this doesn't stop (exaggerated) accusations that the "dudebro" games are typically played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">pottymouthed 10-year-olds</a>.

<ul><li> Cream the Rabbit, too. Beloved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">moe</a> fans for her deliberate cuteness, despised by the older <em>Sonic</em> fans for having a submissive attitude contrary to the defiant one around which the series was built. This is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">Americans Hate Tingle</a>, however — Cream was designed around Japanese fans, who enjoy her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a> traits, and was never meant to be embraced in the west, whereas characters like Blaze the Cat fall more in line of likable female characters outside of Asia. This has more or less faded as of the mid-2010s: the younger generation of fans who grew up with the early Modern-era games where Cream was prominent (and are now adults) tend to think much more fondly of her than the old guard, who have either grown out of the series, have found other <em>Sonic</em> characters they dislike more, or just aren't as vocal about their dislike for the character. Saying that Cream has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> may be a bit much, but these days, it isn't at all hard to find at least a few people who will name her as a favorite.
</li><li> The entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> franchise got a Periphery Hatedom, including from some of its older fans, though it has less to do with them growing out of it and more with it deviating from what they knew. Those who were <em>never</em> fans tend to regard it as the realm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">unnecessary characters</a> that inspire lame fancharacters and Rule 34 artists.
</li><li> Lots of people in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">hentai</a> community hate the <em>Sonic</em> franchise as well. Though this stems more from the fact that a lot of Rule 34 artists that draw pornography images of Sonic and co. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">really can't draw</a> Rule 34 all that well. This becomes especially obvious if you know that most artists in the community avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">Sturgeon's Law</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Sonic</em> franchise has also gathered some hatred from fans of other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> franchises because it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">Adored by the Network</a>.

This is a bigger point of contention with Western fans than Japanese fans since the franchise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">has more popularity outside its native Japan than within it</a>, while this isn't the case back in Japan where some of Sega's other current Japanese franchises overtake <em>Sonic</em>'s in popularity and may even be Cash Cow Franchises in their own right there and there, only. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">No Export for You</a> situations these same games may suffer only adds more fuel to the fire some Western Sega fans will have against <em>Sonic</em>.
</li><li> A significant chunk of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Adventure</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">series</a> fanbase <em>loath <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em> and its sequels for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">less</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">mature</a> and mostly 2.5D as opposed to fully 3D.
</li></ul></li><li> EA tried to exploit this with their "Your Mom hates <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em>" marketing campaign. It didn't exactly work; the <em>intended</em> market responded with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Thanks a lot for casting us all as immature jerks</a>. It's not like games don't have trouble with that perception already." It seemed to completely miss gaming's shift in demographics, as explained below.
</li><li> Video games in general fell into this category when they became popular during the '80s and '90s. In many cases, there was a notable divide between the children who enjoyed playing them and parents who felt they distracted them from doing more constructive things. Since many of today's parents grew up with them, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope">this is a dying trope</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 2DS</a>, which removes the clamshell and 3D features and sells at a lower price than the original 3DS, has received a fair number of complaints from adult and teenage gamers, despite being designed as an 'entry-level' system for children.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24c0je');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24c0je" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24c0je');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The 3D feature is not recommended for young children, due to lack of safety testing. The clamshell is the weakest part of the physical design and, therefore, most likely to be broken by small children who haven't yet grasped the concept of "excessive force results in broken toys". The lower price isn't specifically a child-friendly feature, but savvy gamers have noticed that the difference is exactly the cost of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, a franchise well known for its younger-demographic appeal and with which the 2DS shares its release date.</span>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Switch Lite</a>, handheld version of Switch, went through a similar cycle, gathering a lot of flak from fans for ditching the primary feature of original console (being able to use it both as a home and portable device) despite being primarily made as an option for people who prefer their games on the go.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars">Console Wars</a> are a recurring example: Those who pick one side have no desire to try anything from the other sides. It's an enforced mindset, as a console is an expensive investment and most can't afford to buy multiple systems.
</li><li> People who play EA sports games get a lot of hatred of gamers who do not play them. The main reason behind it seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks">that they are the same game in a brand new package</a> and the fact that it is blamed for making games more unoriginal. Then there's the fact that the FIFA games introduced and normalized the much disliked lootboxes in full-priced AAA games, which many have compared to gambling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> received this from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">a chunk of older US gamers</a> in general, and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mon</a> fans, simply because it was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">current big thing</a> in Japan amongst elementary school children. It received a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">Fandom Rivalry</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> due to them being perceived as similar. Many gamers, even major Nintendo reviewers, ignored the series because it was too similar to <em>Pokémon</em> for their liking.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> there was a lot of scorn from "hardcore" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> gamers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon">Spyro the Dragon</a></em>, which was made to draw young children to the console. The games were mocked as cash-grabs that shouldn't be popular on a "big kid" console like the PS1. The hatedom has since become non-existent as many current hardcore gamers were fans of the series growing up.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a> is disliked by many retro gamers who prefer to ignore consoles before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">NES</a>. People often complain about the graphics and quality of the games (especially arcade ports).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>'s slot machines, especially their newer ones, are hated by <em>millions</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">Western</a> gamers who are sore about most of Konami's consumer IPs getting the short end of the stick, even though most of these people will probably never touch one of these machines in their entire lives due to pachislots being largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japan-exclusive</a>. It should be noted that Konami has had an active pachislot division since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">1994</a>, but this was largely unknown to Westerners until Konami Digital Entertainment's controversial actions of 2015 and 2016, at which point people looked at what Konami still had to offer, noticed KPE's ten-upcoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice-laden</a> <em>Castlevania: Erotic Violence</em> slot machine, and then came down <strong>hard</strong> on that and every subsequent KPE-produced slot machine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> is the polar opposite of what is expected from shooters: It's very brightly colored, the protagonists are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">teenagers</a>, it's full of comedy and slapstick, the violence is (mostly) non-lethal, there is no voice chat, and there is no (traditional) war or scifi element to it. Naturally this has caused many fans of series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> to mock the series for being "kiddy" and "not a real shooter". Inversely, many fans of <em>Splatoon</em> dislike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">boring colors</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">overly serious</a> nature of <em>COD</em>; to say nothing of accusations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation">Capcom Sequel Stagnation</a> as opposed to <em>Splatoon</em> being a new IP.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinIITheNewColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinIITheNewColossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a></em> unsurprisingly gets this treatment from far-right gamers and neo-Nazis due to its heavy emphasis on the racist, sexist, and violent ideology of the Nazis, and being set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvadedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvadedStatesOfAmerica">Nazi-occupied</a> United States of America. This is more apparent with the rise of the far right amidst the election of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">certain controversial businessman</a> in late 2016, with the game being released just under a year later in 2017. While the <em>Wolfenstein</em> series had never portrayed Nazis in a positive light, the much more serious tone of its recent games ended up finally catching the attention of those those who were targeted in the first place.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a></em> seems to have become for Millennial parents what Barney was for their Gen X predecessors. Those jokes about him having cancer or being bald from chemotherapy speak volumes. Aside from moms who have had experiences with their children copying the titular character's tantrums, parents make up only a small percentage of haters here—much, much more of the hatedom comes from high school students who simply hate the show for being slow, and 9-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GoAnimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GoAnimate">Go Animate</a> users who dislike the show because the titular character tends to whine a lot in the earlier seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>, which had all of the hatred of people who never watched it a good decade before Barney did. One defunct site even pointed out various chilling similarities while comparing The Smurfs to the KKK, though most haters usually compare them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">communists</a> instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales">Dragon Tales</a></em>, due to Ord's incessant whining and the somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Sugar Bowl</a> environment that is Dragon Land. And some religions cite dragons as evil, which is why there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">a (negative) trope named after them.</a> However, it's starting to get a following, mostly from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> type. Another reason for so many people hating it is because many people feel that, for a show about magical fire-breathing <em>dragons</em>, the series is surprisingly lacking in fantasy-based adventure. It doesn't help that many of the things the dragons do in the show (IE: go to school, learn to ride bikes, etc.) would be things you'd expect to see in a show about regular people, not dragons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em>: Part of it is because of the vandalism caused by fans of the show to random pages on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>. But there's a fair amount of hate from non-Christians, too, for being a religious show for young kids (though there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> among the same segment too). <em>VeggieTales</em> tends to have enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a> (in the form of pop cultural references  e.g., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">the French peas guarding the wall of Jericho</a>) to avoid the "babyish" criticism from adults, though.

</li><li> Despite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SquirrelBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SquirrelBoy">Squirrel Boy</a></em> doing decently with critics and young viewers, the Internet has an extremely vocal hatedom for the show. Frequent reasons for hating the show include "blandness" and simply not being as good as Everett Peck's previous cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em> (though the two have very different audiences). In fact, some believe that the show's early cancellation was caused by the huge outcry from the Internet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperWhy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperWhy">Super Why!</a></em> has a very strong hatedom. Many parents don't like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> plotlines, and fairy tale fans hate the Disneyfication of the fairy tales presented to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">being politically correct</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToopyAndBinoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToopyAndBinoo">Toopy and Binoo</a></em>, a Canadian preschool show, has seen complaints from moms and parent groups due to the title characters' frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">crossdressing</a> and use of the word "fabulous", leading said moms/parent groups to believe that the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> and are presenting homosexuality-related concepts to children too young to make an informed decision on the matter, without an attempt to educate them on the topic.

Additionally, some VHS and DVDs of the show were released by Tommy Nelson—a Christian distributor, who redubbed it to insert references to Christianity even though the series wasn't originally conceived as a Christian show, to the annoyance of some non-Christians.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyLooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyLooneyTunes">Baby Looney Tunes</a></em>, though probably not meant for anyone over the age of six, has received particular loathing not just from fans of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>, but of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>. Of course, in the latter case it's probably more out of embarrassment than anything else, since <em>Tiny Toons</em> fans see themselves as cool and fear being lumped in with the <em>Baby Looney Tunes</em> crowd. To a somewhat lesser extent, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> gained one due to its focus on sitcom scenarios over the zany antics of the classic shorts.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProblemSolverz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProblemSolverz">The Problem Solverz</a></em>, partly because of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse">Sensory Abuse</a>.

</li><li> Any cartoon in general that is released in a new decade (especially true with '90s kids) will get some amount of hate from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">older generations</a>, regardless of the show in question's actual merits. Even popular shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> will get this reaction from some groups.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> has become loathed by adult Marvel fans who find the show too comedic and immature compared to other Marvel cartoons from the same period, or the comic with the same name.

Others simply take their frustration on <em>Spectacular</em> being cancelled (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">for an unforeseen rights issue caused by the Disney/Marvel deal</a>) on it.

There are also parents who believe that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2084021/Is-Peppa-Pig-making-toddlers-naughty-Parents-despair-children-copy-cartoon-answering-back.html">the show inspires kids to have bad behavior<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Ever since The Jim Henson Company ventured into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CGI">CGI</a> animation, many vocal Muppet fans are calling foul at various social media sites, saying that the company should stick to puppets and not venture out to other media. There is no real explanation for this behavior except irrational fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordParty">Word Party</a></em>, the company's latest production, has got to be the latest victim of this; some of said vocal fans are already comparing it to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies">Teletubbies</a></em> even before the show premiered.
</li><li> Despite its acclaim and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> of DC Comics fans and other adults that don't like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DCSuperheroGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DCSuperheroGirls">DC Super Hero Girls</a></em> for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> approach to classic heroes and villains with the biggest offender being Harley Quinn, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever">Ruined Forever</a> according to detractors. Many of those detractors complain specifically about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a> while having no idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">comics Harley had been an antihero for years at that point</a>. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCSuperHeroGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCSuperHeroGirls">in 2019</a>, which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever">Super Best Friends Forever</a></em> with no relation to the original <em>DC Super Hero Girls</em>, made her and other traditionally villainous characters evil again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWackyWorldOfTexAvery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWackyWorldOfTexAvery">The Wacky World of Tex Avery</a></em>, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">having nothing to do with the cartoons of the person it was named after</a>, having an <strong>extremely</strong> annoying theme song, having many of the shorts being too predictable and lame, and replacing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDisneyAfternoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDisneyAfternoon">The Disney Afternoon</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.toonzone.net/tex-avery-the-wacky-world-of/">in some parts of the United States.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Supernoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Supernoobs">Supernoobs</a></em> was a target for hatred by people outside of its target audience, due to it being made by the same man behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em> and people getting sick of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s reliance on Canadian imports. Many people attempted to justify their hate of the show by claiming that the show focused too much on cliche plotlines and that its main characters mostly consist of children who behave selfishly, and said characters have extremely vague and ambiguous backstories that were kind of difficult to understand and follow because of their behavior. Regardless of whether people liked it or not, it seems Cartoon Network didn't care for it either, as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">didn't air reruns and punted it around its schedule</a> before pawning it off on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a>.
</li><li> If a British children's book is adapted as an animated show, expect there to be people who are fans of the source material and don't like how the show made it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> and/or saccharine and childish. Examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">Make Way For Noddy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMrMenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMrMenShow">The Mr. Men Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note319des');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note319des" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note319des');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> mostly the later seasons, the earlier ones have many fans including those of the original books.</span> <em>Make Way For Noddy</em> also has a huge hatedom among GoAnimate users and the GOOD USER/BAD USER community due to the titular character always acting positive and falling for the goblins' tricks. This has resulted in Noddy appearing in more grounded videos than more mainstream characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues">Joe</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Elmo</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CuriousGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CuriousGeorge">Curious George</a></em> tends to get flack from parents because of the titular character always ruining whatever task he is assigned and not getting reprimanded for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCatsRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCatsRoar">ThunderCats Roar</a></em> received very fierce backlash the moment it was announced for its art style being similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em> (among others), and being a comedy-driven adaptation of an action series coming off the heels of the wildly-divisive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>. Others hate it because it's not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em> (which, ironically, also got hated when it first aired, albeit for different reasons). <em>Roar</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/ThunderCatsRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/ThunderCatsRoar">YMMV page</a> was locked almost immediately after its creation due to excessive complaining, and its scores on review sites are extremely low due to excessive review bombing.
</li><li> The newer episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam">Fireman Sam</a></em> have gotten flack from many viewers and parents because of Norman being portrayed as a bratty prankster who promises not to do any mean tricks again, but does them anyway the next time in almost every single episode; in the older version of the show, he rarely did pranks and listened to the advice of the fire team.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HorridHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HorridHenry">Horrid Henry</a></em> is very well-hated among parents in the UK, as it depicts a boy who continually exhibits bad behavior no matter how many times he's scolded by his parents, which like <em>Caillou</em> above often gets imitated by children who watch the show, <a class="urllink" href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/parents-banning-children-watching-horrid-henry-104258974.html">much to the disdain of their parents.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It also gains hate from other viewers because of Henry's parents' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">blatant favoritism</a> towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Perfect Peter</a>, which results in Peter always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">getting away with acting like a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">spoiled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> often found itself being slammed by conservative Americans, due to the show's left-wing politics and the increasing amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">later seasons</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AbbyHatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AbbyHatcher">Abby Hatcher</a></em> has a huge hatedom of parents who despise it because of the Fuzzlies teaching kids to speak improperly (one example is how several characters say "me" instead of "I").
