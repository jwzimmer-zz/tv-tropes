Whose that?)</a>. There will also probably be humorous references to how the celebrities of The Present Day have ended up by then. An amusingly (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">horrifyingly</a>) dated one of these appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em>, which had a newspaper in 2015 make reference to "Queen Diana" (on the amusing side, Elizabeth II was still Queen in 2015...and on the horrifying side, Princess Diana died in 1997, eight years after the film came out).

</p><p>The "fish" will probably make little effort to fit in, awing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalMorons">the locals</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALittleSomethingWeCallRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALittleSomethingWeCallRockAndRoll">A Little Something We Call "Rock and Roll"</a>, telling them that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyBoomstick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyBoomstick">This Is My Boomstick</a> and possibly becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit">Blithe Spirit</a>.

The "fish" may also describe the future in an ironic way or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">tell people about things which would have seemed impossible or ridiculous in that era</a>:

They will also likely refer to the newest and most advanced technologies as "quaint". Fortunately, they will have brought back lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, just in case there was any doubt that they really were from The Future.

They will also be horrified and disgusted by some of the mundane tropes and conventions until they are carefully explained. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">"Hot dog?

</p><p><strong>Someone from The Past ends up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePresentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePresentDay">The Present Day</a></strong>: The humor will result from the "fish" attempting to relate to The Present Day with only the knowledge of a previous time. Naturally, they will make mistakes and/or be awed by things which the audience has come to take for granted. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> between the two eras may come up. This is now its own subtrope - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFutureIsShocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFutureIsShocking">The Future Is Shocking</a>.
</p><p>If they're from any time after about the midpoint of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution">Industrial Revolution</a> (when people first began to take for granted that the future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">will be different</a> from the present), the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack">surprised</a> by a future that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFutureIsShocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFutureIsShocking">strange</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">in an unexpected way</a>" trope will probably apply.
</p><p>If they're from far enough back, their first encounter with a motor vehicle <em>will</em> involve the words "metal demon", or alternately "horseless carriage". They will also be completely unfamiliar with the word "computer" in spite of this being a common retooled word, which once meant someone who does calculations or 'computes' for a living. Not knowing the word "accountant" would be just as unusual.
</p><p>If the character is from one of the more romanticized time periods, such as the Middle Ages, Antiquity or any age dominated by warriors, princes, kings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSchoolChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSchoolChivalry">Old-School Chivalry</a>, they will regard the people of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFatFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFatFuture">present as soft, weak, and uncultured</a> (especially the men) and will often upstage and shame the modern men, winning the present day women over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKissYourHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKissYourHand">gallant or gentlemanly behavior</a>. In more recent works, this has however, become more subverted due to the influence of feminism and the historical fact that these time periods <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularHistory">look better in fiction than they did in reality</a>.
</p><p>A character who isn't <em>literally</em> from the past, but somehow deludes himself that he's still living there anyway, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscoDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscoDan">Disco Dan</a>. A character who neither literally from the past nor holds no delusions that he's living there, but is just more comfortable with the attitudes, mindsets and styles of the past than the present is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury">Born in the Wrong Century</a>
</p><p><strong>Someone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a> ends up in The Past</strong>: Fairly common <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> plot (and cause of some of the best episodes and a couple of the worst).

Saburo actually adapts surprisingly easily to living in the past, the transition eased by his high social status and his beautiful new wife, although he puts surprisingly little effort into actually trying to blend in (he gets away with it because nobody can question the leader of the clan, giving him a reputation for eccentricity). It also turns out that various other people from the modern era have ended up back in the past too.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>:
<ul><li> Part of the reason why Steve Rogers is able to don his costume without irony and be an idealist in the modern world is because he was a young man in World War II who was so eager to fight that he volunteered for experiments when he wasn't physically fit for duty, and was then locked in suspended animation afterwards until the modern era.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a> version of Cap had almost exactly that experience, except that he ended up more traumatized than anyone else. Obviously he got better but still had a scary tendency to beat the crap out of people for violating his personal morals. As opposed to modern heroes who do the exact same thing but have values deemed more palatable because they're modern.
</li><li> Cap gets hit harder and harder with this trope every year. Most superheroes operate on a sliding timescale, and thus are relatively modern, or have their origins updated slightly (Spider-Man being bitten by a genetically modified spider instead of a radioactive one, for example), but Cap always started out in WWII, he's just been asleep longer. But when Cap was first woken up, it was only about 20 years later, and the world, while very different, would have been more or less recognizable to him, or at least he would have been able to see how the seeds had been sown from his time. Now he is over 70 years out of date, and the modern world is all but incomprehensible to him when first thawed out.
</li></ul></li><li> Exodus of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> is a very similar case to Cap, being an idealist from an earlier period of history <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedBadassInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedBadassInACan">sealed away</a> and revived in the modern day. The main difference is that, while Cap was sealed in suspended animation in the 1940s, Exodus was sealed away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">over 800 years ago</a>, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">Third Crusade</a>. Like the Ultimates incarnation of Cap, this results in a hardcore champion of antiquated ideals.

Stu Cicero tries to assist him in figuring this out, saying that thankfully Captain America's predicament provides ample precedent to work with. The same series also features Matthew Hawk being brought into the modern day and discovering that his license to practice law expired over a century ago, and the law has changed so much since then that he has difficulty passing the bar exam.
</li><li> The Twelve, twelve random superheroes put in suspended animation by the Nazis in the last days of World War II and discovered sometime in 2007. Virtually all of them have a difficult time adjusting, with the curious exception of the Black Widow.
<ul><li> Black Widow was able to roll with it because she's used to it. She's a lot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a> because of her supernatural origin, being in WWII was already something of an adjustment for her. So with that experience under her belt, what she did was go look for a place where she doesn't stand out too much. In her case it meant hanging around at a local goth club where her air of mystery and novelty of being from WWII made her a figure of respect.

Early on, Billy went to a teen dance and found the styles of clothing, dance and music of the early 1970s jarring compared to what he had been used to in the early '50s.

While he takes a bit to adjust to the current time, when he does, he finds it not too bad.

The Toms are in no position to complain about it, as they were seconds away from death in a rather large bomb explosion (everyone at home thinks they are dead).

Upon arrival, she crashes, damaging two of her legs (and possibly several internal organs, too), although she does receive prosthetics. Understandably, she's horrified by some of the changes her country has undergone, as well as the fact that everyone thinks she's dead.

Desmond's modern speech patterns and the breadth of his (typical) modern education net him several odd looks, although they pale in comparison to the Assassin-grade fighting skills that he's gained from his ancestors.

One of the protagonists, Richard Lubanski, returns home from a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp, one of the last Germans to be repatriated. He finds it hard to adjust to the unfamiliar new West German society which is on its way to give up the strict patriarchal and authoritarian ways he had been accustomed to, and in particular he finds himself unable to deal with his elder son, a young rebel with communist leanings. Richard's situation is aggravated by his own war trauma and the fact that his wife and children have of necessity learned to cope without him during the intervening decade and thus resist his attempts to reimpose the pre-war pattern of him as husband, provider and near-absolute head of the family.

The people around often think there's something off with her as a result.

When the children go to the past, Ian and especially Elinor do not feel like they belong at all, with Elinor constantly complaining of only wanting to get back to the present as soon as possible. Andrew, however, fits in almost right away thanks to some handy archaic clothing and a mercy mission to save the people of Smailholm, befriending Mae, proving himself to the Laird and his men, learning much of history from Cedric, and even witnessing the Battle of Roxburgh. When they all return to the present, it is <em>Ollie</em>, in the mentality of Mae, who is instead completely out of her depth and has to be instructed and helped to become part of that world. Interestingly, she isn't able to fully accept who she is and where she belongs until after another trip where they're all in the wrong time, in the future.

However, the cultural and technological shock is lessened by the previous two books in the series being about his adventures in a galaxy populated by numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> races. He mostly adjusts to life in the 22nd century with his wife (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> princess from planet Tar) but still feels weird when he sees three young people (one of them barely 13) having sex in the woods. When he confronts an older man with this, the man explains that they are all legally considered adults (even the 13-year-old who has passed his self-sufficiency test) and, thus, are granted all possible rights. The older man points out that freedom must not be limited by any one person's morals or it's not freedom at all. So, if three consenting adults want to have wild sex in the woods, they can do that.

He wakes up to find that the war is still on with both sides being too large and powerful to be completely defeated by the other. The concept of fleet tactics is gone due to the heavy attrition of the war (all experts died during the early stages), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> is the default tactic of any ship commander with admirals being more politicians than fleet commanders (captains actually vote on what to do next). Saluting has been forgotten (except by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a>, of course). Interestingly, technology hasn't changed <em>that</em> much in 100 years, although weapons are slightly more powerful and ships can now send brief messages during FTL jumps. Additionally, a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Portal Network</a> speeds up fleet movements, although Geary is forced to avoid it. Basically, being an average commander in his own time, "Black Jack" Geary (as he's now known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a>) is a tactical genius thanks to nobody else knowing how to control an entire fleet in three dimensions with a time lag.

</div></li><li> Speaking of which, Fry's on-again-off-again girlfriend Michelle is a prime example in "Cryonic Woman". She cringes and/or screams at the sight of every weird thing that wasn't in the 20th century, including all the non-human members of the Planet Express crew, and the Professor (once prompted) and Amy (when she says she's from Mars).
</li><li> The reason Fry adapted quickly was more of a production thing: they were finding it hard to create more storylines about Fry adapting to the future, so they turned him into a straight, somewhat dim-witted (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>) man in an insane future.
</li><li> In one episode Fry walks in on a support group for cryonically frozen people. He doesn't really care about anything but the buffet, unlike the guy who lived in a time when man was ruled by sentient carrots, the executive from the 1980s who missed out on the implosion of "merger fever", and the caveman who found his wife in a museum.

A great deal of the comedy in the series is dependent on Jack's lack of understanding in the future. Most notably, "Jack" was a slang three hipsters called him on the streets and he thought that was what they seriously thought his name was.
</li><li> A significant part of the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward</a></em> was seeing them adapt to living 100 years in the future.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MummiesAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MummiesAlive">Mummies Alive!</a></em> used and abused this trope with gay abandon. The mummies, after awakening over 3,000 years after their deaths, obviously have a lot of adjusting to do, but this adjustment period seemed to take an <em>extremely</em> long time, with jokes about the Mummies encountering modern technology making up at least 80% of <em>every single episode</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:

He helps them fight off the monsters several times, and eventually discovers the one responsible for their appearance — Krall, an unscrupulous warrior from the tribe who asked a witch to give him glory, and instead received monsters he couldn't defeat. He asked her for the strength to beat them, and she brought Cyborg from the present. A transformed Krall and his minions lay siege to the warriors' home, and Krall manages to get the upper hand against Sarasim. Before Cyborg can save her, he's pulled back though a time warp to the present by the other Titans. At first he's distraught, but later Raven shows him a book detailing the history of Sarasim's tribe, which shows that they managed to defeat Krall's army, and Sarasim survived.

Later on, Griff of the London Clan of gargoyles is pulled forward fifty years.

</li><li> The major driving plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> is how Aang cryogenically froze himself for 100 years, waking up to find that a war with the Fire Nation started not long after he was frozen, wiped out his entire civilization, and has gone on since then. Sometimes, the show thematically explores the consequences of how things change with time — in an early episode, he meets his only known surviving friend, who is now much older than he is; and about mid-series, he finds what used to be an oasis in the desert to be completely dried up. This is most notably explored, however, whenever the Air Temples are visited — Aang is shown reminiscing about how things are so different in his old homes, especially since for him it wasn't even a year ago that they were full of life.

Apu takes advantage of the situation by changing his store to the 'Freak-E-Mart' with frozen Jasper as an attraction for tourists. This doesn't last very long when the freezer fails and Jasper wakes up and sees the changes in the store, actually thinking he is in the distant future.

Tamusk is at first unaware that he's time traveled and thinks he was simply teleported away from his kingdom. He's disoriented and frightened when he sees several machines, but thinks that the machines and changes to the surroundings are the result of magic. He then mistakes King Randor for a usurper and attempts to fight him to regain his kingdom.

<ul><li> A Polish man named Jan Grzebski fell into a coma in 1988 and woke up from it in 2007, by which time Communism had long since collapsed. Of the experience, he said "When I went into a coma there was only tea and vinegar in the shops, meat was rationed and huge petrol queues were everywhere. Now I see people on the streets with cell phones and there are so many goods in the shops it makes my head spin."
</li><li> Charles Robert Jenkins, an American soldier, defected to North Korea in 1965 and remained cut off from the Western world. He made it out in 2004, finding that the U.S. had changed a bit since the 1960s.
</li><li> Just about all of North Korea itself has become this thanks to its isolationism. Apart from a small handful of spots, mostly where a facade was erected to feign modernity and advancement, the country is very firmly entrenched in the 1950s from a cultural and technological perspective. Those who make it out or the rare tourist who makes it in face some serious shock at just how alien life on the inside and outside is.
<ul><li> On the flip side, North Koreans who defect to South Korea or even China are essentially travelling forward in time by 50 or 60 years, and are often bewildered by a half-century's worth of new technology and changing customs. South Korea even has a school, Hanawon, where North Korean refugees are taught how to function in South Korean society.
</li></ul></li><li> Some Japanese soldiers were stranded on some remote Pacific islands during WWII, and unaware of the fact that their side had lost until they were discovered in the '60s and '70s. For example, Lt. Hiroo Onoda continued fighting WWII for 30 years on the island of Lubang. He wrote a book entitled <em>No Surrender: My Thirty-Year War.</em> He was reportedly very disturbed by what he saw in changing traditional values.
</li><li> A man fled to the jungle during the 1969 "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Football War</a>" between El Salvador and Honduras. He finally "surrendered" to a group of lumberjacks he mistook for enemy soldiers more than 30 years later, telling them he was tired of running away. The saddest part is that the actual war lasted a total of <em>four days</em>.
</li><li> Prisoners who serve long jail sentences (over 15 years, usually) sometimes find themselves confounded by modern technology and culture when they leave prison. For example, there was an ex-convict who tried to steal a car shortly after getting out, having missed the invention and application of car alarms. Sadly, there are more than a few cases of released prisoners committing new crimes specifically to get caught (or outright killing themselves) as a result of this. They simply cannot cope, and there are no social services to help them adjust. Explored in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em> (story and film) with Brooks and, to a lesser extent, with Red.
</li><li> Similar to prisoners, expatriates can find themselves out of step with the culture of their home countries when they return if they've been away for a long time. Fortunately, the internet makes it easier to keep up with what's going on back home these days.
