</p><p>Or maybe the character is an inventor ahead of their time who just can't convince anyone that their crazy ideas could make a benefit for mankind, or a sci-fi buff who only wishes that all those stories about spaceships and flying cars were real, or a subculture waiting for the time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">the world will be ready</a> for them.
</p><p>No matter what the reason, though, this character feels that they were born in the wrong century.
</p><p>Characters of this sort often find themselves involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> adventures — maybe they jump at the chance to test out some new time travel technology; maybe they're selected because their knowledge of the era will be useful to their fellow time travelers; maybe they just want to travel through time so badly that the fabric of spacetime folds itself for them for no adequately explained reason. Sometimes, these characters learn that the time they wanted to live in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">isn't so great after all</a>, but just as often they don't.

Characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">a crapsack country</a> ravaged by plague, famine, or an evil dictator, are probably justified in feeling this way, but are rarely depicted unless they live in a future dystopia. Alternatively, like in the page quote, these characters are people who would like to return to a time when physical violence was a good pathway to fame and fortune.

<ul><li> Nobita in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> was pretty much a loser in his time where his only useful skill is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">super-accurate marksmanship</a>. In the stories in which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travels</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>, he often ended up becoming a hero due to said-marksmanship which drove away the bandits.
</li><li> Yuri, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>, is a more understated instance of this trope. While she enjoys life in her own time and country, she is spirited away to and grows to love Anatolia so much that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she gives up her last chance to go home, in favor of staying</span>. She does use more modern discoveries while there, among them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">ideas like keeping the injured and sick in sanitary conditions</a>, but she also connects insanely to the land, the people, and the culture. Note that despite time travel being possible in this world, Kail himself is an example of the second form of this trope. While he's not able to travel to present times, a lot of his viewpoints (citizens being treated equally, being monogamous in marriage, etc.) are ones that would be perfectly normal in modern times but pretty unusual in his time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em>, set at the time of Vikings, briefly features a character that still lives as if the Roman Empire never ended.

<ul><li> The Marquis de Sade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvisibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvisibles">The Invisibles</a></em>: Locked up for obscenity in the 18th century, he finds himself embraced with open arms by the fetish club scene of present-day San Francisco.
</li><li> Not exactly time travel but close enough. Travis Morgan, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheWarlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheWarlord">The Warlord</a></em>, was a lot happier in the savage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld">Lost World</a> of Skartaris than he ever had been in the 20th century.
</li><li> Working for Oracle, before the New 52, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em> is Zinda Blake, better known as <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyBlackhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyBlackhawk">Lady Blackhawk</a>, a fighter pilot and hero from the 1950s who found herself in the modern day after a time warp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">sends her forward several decades</a>. Due to her highly liberal and controversial beliefs, such as her determination to become a fighter pilot, she finds herself much more comfortable in the modern day DC Universe than she did back in her own era. The only notable problems she seems to have is that her taste in music is a few decades behind the times, and she can hardly get anybody to honor her senior citizens discount.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> team-up in <em>Detective Comics</em> in 1997, Wally Dalbert, a 27th century thief who committed his crimes by travelling backwards in time but had no way of travelling forwards, eventually settled to become a philanthropist in 19th century Gotham, where he had previously indicated he would feel more at home.
</li><li> Subverted by time-travelling foes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, Abra Kadabra and Professor Zoom, who travelled to the 20th century because they felt out of place in their own eras, and turned out not to fit in very well there either.
</li><li> Played with in the case of Klara Prast of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a>, who travelled forward in time from the early 20th century to the early 21st. On the one hand, she doesn't miss her old life of being married to (and exploited by) her abusive alcoholic husband at the age of <em>eleven</em>, or the persecution she used to suffer because of her plant-controlling abilities. On the other hand, she finds many aspects of the modern world baffling (it doesn't help that her guide to the modern world is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Molly Hayes</a>, whose own understanding of the world is rather spotty.)

In fact he actually thrives there: he becomes the well-respected town blacksmith and even finds love. He even requests in a letter that Marty not go back for him. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BackToTheFuture">IDW comic book</a> says the same of Doc's wife Clara, an intelligent, strong-willed woman who loves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> but was born in the 1800s. As shown in the movie, this ends up becoming the common bond that leads to their falling in love.
</li><li> This is the whole premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightInParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightInParis">Midnight in Paris</a></em>; the protagonist feels like he would have loved to live in 1920s Paris, only to find a way to visit that era. There, he falls in love with a woman who wants to live in the 1890s, and when the two visit that time they find out the people back then wanted to live in the Renaissance.
</li><li> The whole premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBradyBunchMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBradyBunchMovie">The Brady Bunch Movie</a></em> is that the '70s incarnation of the family is transplanted into 1995 and comically unaware of the world around them being different than it was back then.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomewhereInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomewhereInTime">Somewhere in Time</a></em> has the protagonist falling in love with a long-dead actress from the past.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeAfterTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeAfterTime">Time After Time</a></em>, Jack Richardson (aka Jack the Ripper) gloats to Wells on how in 1893, his brutal murders were too horrific to contemplate. When he travels to 1979 San Francisco, he realizes that in the late 20th century, such violence is almost quaint compared to what is seen on the daily news.
<div class="indent"><strong>Richardson</strong>: Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Today, I'm an amateur.

She winds up discovering that the Victorian era is not as great as she thought it was. A later book has an ahead-of-her-time Victorian girl travelling to the 1990s, with similar results — the culture shock is just too great for her to feel comfortable staying there.

The main character lives in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. He believes he lives in the worst time ever and dreams of escaping to the past. He discovers time travelers appearing from a small town and finds out that they are being sent there as a form of therapy because they believe that his time period is a Golden Age. The time travel technicians point out to him that in real life it would be nearly impossible for anyone to adapt adequately to live in a past time period. The time travelers are being sent back as a form of therapy to get them to readjust to life in their present, and most soon come back after finding they can't live in that time period. It is also pointed out that there is probably no point in time that someone, somewhere, and somewhen <em>doesn't</em> think is a golden age.

Eventually, he invaded the workshop of a Leonardo da Vinci-expy, Bold Lion, to get <em>something</em> of a power-up (as an inventor's home would be the only place where he could find any machinery of significance), only to be sealed away. Cue several centuries later, in the modern day, where he's released.

Villard is the owner and master of a fencing school which was founded by his father, a famous fencing champion who nonetheless died in a duel with a student he found out was having an affair with his wife. Villard thus sees his father as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">something of a highly touted failure</a>, since the father spent decades training his skills only to be killed the first time he was in a duel that actually mattered, and the younger Villard is desperate to know if his own skills and ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> philosophy are any better or if he's just been wasting his life trying to master swordsmanship. As a result he eagerly yearns for the days when he might have fought another master at rapier's point. Eventually Villard learns that the truth about his father's duel is a little more complicated than he believed <em>and</em> has a chance to engage in a real sword fight, which seems to cure his longing to live in an earlier age.

</li><li> On the other hand the Commonwealth, and Eastern Europe in general, rested on something that had already gone out of style in the rest of Western Europe: serfdom.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wv59');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3wv59" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wv59');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">the early Modern Era,</a> serfdom and feudalism itself were weakening in the West in favor of strong centralized kingdoms in France, England and Spain which nurtured the rise of cities and the development of the middle-class. In the Commonwealth, where originally peasants were given rights to travel and work at their will, they had those rights taken away and were all refeudalized.</span> The decentralized nature of the Commonwealth meant that any attempts at grand-scale reform to bring Poland up to snuff with its Western neighbors threatened one regional faction or the other, and these factions often allied with neighbouring Russia, Austria or Prussia to protect their interests over that of the Commonwealth. The limit of franchise exclusively to nobles, lack of cultivation of a middle class and at the same time the promotion of "noble equality" meant that Poland was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">a medieval feudal republic</a> in the age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">enlightened monarchs and emerging mass movements.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> 19th-century emperor Ludwig II of Bavaria, who built a lot of medieval-style castles. These were actually not really medieval since those castles were built for the purposes of withstanding a siege and holding a defense, while Ludwig's castles are essentially aesthetic and made for show, and where castle and cathedral construction in the Middle Ages actually did provide solid employment to local craftsmen and guilds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">by the time of the 19th century, these were mostly expensive ehite elephants built at state (read: taxpayer) expense.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a> is claimed to have invented the radio (Guglielmo Marconi), wireless electricity, fluorescent lightbulbs (Heinrich Geissler), arc lights (Humphrey Davy), alternating current, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">(allegedly)</a> the Tesla Coil — a machine that could <em>shoot lightning</em>. He even had plans for a proto-Internet. He also claimed that electrically-powered airships would transport passengers from New York to London in three hours, traveling eight miles above the ground, and imagined that airships might draw their power from the very atmosphere, never needing to stop for refueling. Unfortunately, his rival Thomas Edison did all he could to discredit him. Tesla also had horrible business sense, and so couldn't afford to develop most of his ideas.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> was said by many to be at least 500 years ahead of his time in terms of his imagination. The irony being that if he was, many of the inventions we have today inspired from his works probably wouldn't exist. Leonardo's sense of being apart from his time was part of the reason that he was such a great celebrity for his age (and perhaps the first artist-as-celebrity in history), because the period and time he was in, saw itself as modern and on the cusp of great changes, not expecting the Reformation and Counter-Reformation would delay its plans for another 200 years or so.
</li><li> 16th-century painter <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/ElGreco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/ElGreco">El Greco</a>, whose art was seen as far too eccentric in his lifetime, was forgotten until art historians rediscovered his work in the 20th century and were amazed how modern it looked.

</li><li> Dutch author Godfried Bomans lived in the 20th century, but his interests and writing style showcased a strong love for the 19th century.
</li><li> Anton Pieck, a 20th-century Dutch illustrator <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5iayg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5iayg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5iayg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> known for his involvement with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Efteling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Efteling">Efteling</a>'s Sprookjesbos </span>, was well known for his drawings and paintings of 19th-century life. He was very old-fashioned and didn't even own modern technology. Many people assumed he'd already died decades ago, since his art always portrayed scenes taking place in the 19th century.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> also felt that humanity was its best in the 19th century and went downhill after that. He was born in 1901, by the way.
</li><li> French composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ErikSatie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ErikSatie">Erik Satie</a> lived near the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, but had a strong emotional connection to the Middle Ages.
</li><li> 20th-century Belgian comic strip artist Willy Vandersteen (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em>) drew many stories taking place in different romanticized versions of the historical past. The only time period of his own century he considered to be interesting was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and even that only happened in one album (<em>De Briesende Bruid</em>) for a short scene.
</li><li> American comic strip artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb">Robert Crumb</a> has a strong emotional connection to the 1920s and 1930s and owns a large collection of music records and other memorabilia from this time period. He generally feels that society and culture went downhill after the 1940s. Despite being an icon of the 1960s he despises modern rock 'n' roll and pop music.
</li><li> Children's book author and illustrator Tasha Tudor believed she was supposed to be alive during the 1830s. She owned and used an extensive collection of clothing and artifacts from that time and even went so far as to have her son build her a house from that era (using old-time technology and materials), and said publicly that when she died she was going to reincarnate into the 1830s. She died in 2008 at age 92.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and many prominent Nazis longed for a revival of the glorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> from previous centuries. It comes as no surprise that they all enjoyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a>, whose operas show a mythological Germany full of strong, admirable heroes. It should be noted that the "glorious" Germany <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">they longed for was largely invented and dreamt up in the 19th century</a> by the likes of Wagner.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco">Francisco Franco</a> also longed to revive the days of the old Spanish Empire. So much, in fact, that it was the reason he asked Hitler to grant him territories in North Africa (Morocco and the Western Sahara) and the only things allowed in Spain were Baroque architecture/art in general (because it was born in Spain), Catholicism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">heterosexuality</a> (gay poets like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FedericoGarciaLorca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FedericoGarciaLorca">Federico García Lorca</a> were banned) and women had to actually go to school to get a degree as housekeepers. With so much going on, it's no wonder why many people half-jokingly say Spain did not come out of the Middle Ages until after 1975 (Franco's death).
</li><li> Those who knew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickDrake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickDrake">Nick Drake</a> said he would have been better off in the 1600s or 1700s, evident from the way he dressed and the way his lyrics usually had to do with the seasons. He is said by some to be the reincarnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKeats">John Keats</a>.
</li><li> It has been said of two famous British Army officers, who achieved renown in the latter part of the twentieth century, that they were born in the wrong century. Both Colonel "H" Jones (who won a posthumous VC for suicidal bravery in the Falklands War in 1982) and Colonel Colin Mitchell (who restored British prestige in the Aden War in 1967 after half-hearted political leadership virtually ceded the colony to Soviet-backed rebels) were fated to fight their battles in a time of Imperial decline. It has been said of both that had they been born when the British Empire was in the ascendant, a lot more of the world would have been coloured pink on the map. The social attitudes of both would have been more suited to the high days of Empire in the 19th century.
<ul><li> It has been suspected that "Mad Mitch", as Mitchell was known, was prominent in the rumoured conspiracy to overthrow the Labour government of the 1970s in a military coup d'etat. Establishment disaffection with Britain's slide from superpower status, failing economic power and social liberalisation manifested in hostility to Harold Wilson's government and rumours persist of a plotted overthrowing by force of a democratically-elected government. A charismatic soldier turned very-right-wing Tory MP known to be embittered with his political masters would have been a natural member of such a junta.
</li><li> Another 20th-century British soldier, this one from World War II, might also be a throwback to an older era— Major Jack Churchill, a commando officer from World War II, often went into combat with a sword and a longbow —and he is the last British soldier known to have killed an enemy with a longbow.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> The Taliban planned to turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> back to the old Islamic Caliphate. The Islamic State has similar designs for Iraq and Syria, banning anything "Western" and enforcing draconian interpretations of old Islamic laws (though much like the Nazis, theirs was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion">Theme Park Version</a> of the old Caliphate that never really existed, and at the very least wasn't too fond of destroying entire ancient cities for being "blasphemous").
</li><li> The long-serving Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich hated revolutions but had to spend his whole life witnessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> and its aftermath. He expressed this exact feeling in one of his letters to Dorothea Lieven: "My life has coincided with a wretched epoch. I came into the world too soon or too late; today I know I can do nothing. Earlier I should have enjoyed the pleasures of my age; later I should have helped in reconstruction. Now I spend my life in propping up buildings mouldering in decay. I ought to have been born in 1900 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">to have had the twentieth century before me</a>."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleksandrSolzhenitsyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleksandrSolzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>: This author had strong romantic passion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a>, a time period he never experienced personally (he was born in 1918, a year after the Russian Revolution).
</li><li> European monarchs at the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> still thought with the mindset of their ancestors in previous centuries. They imagined themselves as glorious despots to whom the ordinary people still looked up to. None of them realized that their glory days were on their way out. After the war, many of them were forced to abdicate, as their countries became republics or dictatorships.
<ul><li> Some generals during World War I had the same problem, particularly within Austria-Hungary and Russia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">However, their problem was not so much that they clung to old tactical methods as that they abandoned all of them in their rush to implement new ones without thinking through the implications/side-effects.</a> The primary way in which this played out was the balance of power between infantry and artillery, which Born in the Wrong Century generals initially believed to be equal. But come 1914-15, they came to believe that modern artillery was so powerful that it could now win entire battles on its own ("Artillery Destruction" tactics), and that there was no point in giving the infantry new and/or more weapons (mortars, light machine guns, grenades) or training (infiltration, suppression fire). It took the battles of 1916-17 before the limitations of the artillery were fully appreciated, and "Artillery Suppression" tactics in partnership with a strengthened infantry arm won the war for the Entente Cordiale.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>: although it's more born in the wrong millennium, than born in the wrong century. He identified strongly with the heroes of the Iliad, who supposedly lived 2,000 years before his time. When he was crowned Pharaoh of Egypt, he decided to use the titles that Old Kingdom Pharaohs had used, rather than the ones used by the New Kingdom rulers: again, suggesting a strong nostalgia for the Bronze Age. On the flip side, the Hellenistic civilization he helped to spread appears eerily modern: enthusiastic about scientific discovery and technological development, favor toward emotional expression in artwork, and a positive view of ethnic diversity as well as treating handicapped people with considerably more respect than in previous times. Also, Alexander generalized the Carian court system rules to his entire Empire, which gave women in the entire Middle East the right to sue in court through a male proxy and legally own any profits from investing their dowry. This had a few effects: 1) it created the first professional lawyers, since women needed a male proxy in court, and then men found themselves getting trounced by these guys who had studied the legal code. 2) there was a small group of independently wealthy women who became politically and socially influential. This small group of independently wealthy women would later play a big role in the rise of Christianity. 3) women became patrons of the arts in their own right, meaning that for the first time we start to see women's preferences reflected in artwork. Also in this vein, cosmetology starts to get taken seriously for the first time: which is a very good thing for the field of chemistry.
</li><li> Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were born in the wrong decade. 15 years earlier they would have been right at home with Wild West outlaws like John Wesley Hardin, Jesse James, the Clanton clan and Billy the Kid. 15 years later and they would have become gangsters alongside John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd and "Babyface" George Nelson. Instead, they became Wild West outlaws in a Wild West that increasingly did not exist.

Had he been born a century later, he would have been heralded as one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution alongside the likes of Henry Bessemer and James Watt.
