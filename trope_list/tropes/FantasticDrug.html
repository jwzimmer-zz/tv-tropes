This meshes perfectly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a>, but would seem completely out of place in a realistic series.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has Refrain, which causes the user to relive their fondest memories, making it especially popular among the downtrodden Japanese. It's also rather important to the plot in several places.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em> has Accela, a powerful nanomachine-powered stimulant that causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaffeineBulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaffeineBulletTime">Accela Bullet Time</a>, heightened senses, and delusional thoughts. It also seems to physically link the user into the Wired, and susceptible to its more esoteric phenomena.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> has the Red Eye, a stimulant which is sprayed in the eye and grants incredibly fast reaction times and dissociation from reality.
</li><li> One episode of the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> has "Yellow Horse", an intravenous drug made from "Space Dust" that causes euphoria &amp; compulsive dancing followed by horrible withdrawal pains. The gang that created it, the bizarre Phantom Club (a group of mostly space colonists dressed up in ridiculous ghost costumes), in typical over the top cartoon villain fashion, apparently intended to get the entire population of Earth addicted so they could take over the world.
</li><li> A wide variety of new drugs are available in the setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a></em> (AKA, <em>Battle Angel Alita</em>), as is typical of futuristic dystopias.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilentMobius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilentMobius">Silent Möbius</a></em> deals with a drug known as Dommel, which is a very powerful performance-enhancing drug with a tendency to mutate its users into hideous monsters before dissolving into a puddle of goo. It's extracted from the body of an demon from another dimension.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TogainuNoChi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TogainuNoChi">Togainu no Chi</a></em> has Line, which increases strength and reduces sanity.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> OVA there exists a drug called "Hustle," which promotes muscle growth and gives the user feelings of invincibility. Kei and Yuri have to face a rogue 3WA agent who's become a kingpin for the drug, and who is high on her own supply.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Fishman Island arc uses this, as does his crew. It's called Energy Steroid, and taking one pill doubles your strength but also shortens your life. We see the full effects at the end where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they age from their prime to weak old men just hours after the battle.</span>
</li><li> From the Punk Hazard arc, we also have NHC10, a highly addictive stimulant drug. It can be used as medicine, but only selected doctors in selected countries are allowed to use it. It only takes a small daily amount of it to be addicted, and its short-time withdrawal symptoms are pain and increased aggression. It's dangerous to the point that the characters who were shown to be addicted to it were writhing on the ground in agony, before going completely apeshit and attacking Luffy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh, and said addicted characters were kidnapped children who were experimented on by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Kerasine, a drug whose symptoms change with the dosage but also make people highly susceptible to suggestion, was a major plot item in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's also what eventually gives Goldie Musou her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">Vetinari Job Security</a> over the Chicago underworld — as she puts it, Kerasine is a perfect drug (a full list of how outrageous it is is on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry">Artistic License  Chemistry</a> for your perusal) and only she can supply it — or she can be arrested and Chicago goes back to its typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobWar">Mob War</a> battlefield of feuding drug dealers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">The heroes let her go</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> has a substance like this produced in the bodies of bees who have fed off flowers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">the Gate</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BananaFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BananaFish">Banana Fish</a></em>, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mysterious "banana fish" that everyone is searching for is actually a variant of LSD that can be used to brainwash someone into doing whatever you want.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVoynichHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVoynichHotel">The Voynich Hotel</a></em> features Mercero, a drug obtained from a marijuana-like plant. It can be smoked, with effects that appear to be much stronger than regular marijuana, and is very addictive, as one character has withdrawal symptoms quite soon after using up his supply and another is still showing symptoms years later.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em>, Bill the Tiger reveals that he dopes himself up on rabbit's blood. In the world of <em>Beastars</em>, many carnivorous species struggle with their predatory instincts, and devouring another animal is considered the worst taboo: as such, rabbit blood is considered an illicit substance akin to steroids, as it stimulates predatory instincts. In addition, there are hidden "black markets" that sell illicit meat from hospitals and funeral homes for carnivores, with the implication that most carnivores are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalAddict">Functional Addicts</a> who eat meat to keep their instincts in check and prevent themselves from killing others, while those who cave into their instincts descend into destructive behaviors, if not outright suicide.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> had "Katies" (from KT-28, possibly a derivative of Ketamine), a type of drug often used by the Top-Knot gangs. It should be noted that this was not so much about avoiding naming real life drugs, but establishing that culture was divergent in this reality given the influence of Dr. Manhattan. Ordinary drugs such as marijuana and cocaine are also mentioned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> has "dreamberries". In the Russian version they're called "Drunkberries".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> comics give us "Venom", a highly addictive "super-steroid" which gives the user incredible strength, alertness, and agility temporarily. When first introduced, Batman himself is using it as a way to cope with his imperfections. He soon realizes he's made a terrible mistake, and must endure a horrific withdrawal before returning to normal. But Venom is most famous as the power source of Batman's enemy Bane, who wears a tank full of the stuff with tubes hooked up to his veins, giving him a constant, steady dose of Venom. The result is that he's incredibly strong (so much so that he once broke Batman's back he got better) but totally dependent on the stuff, and Azrael eventually beat him by cutting off his supply.
<ul><li> The Joker uses a deadly poison called "Joker Venom" or "Smilex" that literally makes its victims laugh to death. Maxie Zeus (during one of his periods of sanity) diluted it with ecstasy and sold it as a recreational drug called Chuckles.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> arc mentioned that Scarecrow has also gotten in on the act, selling a recreational version of his fear-inducing gas; signs of addiction include compulsively scratching one's nape. The same arc suggested that Psycho-Pirate has also somehow made a drug that can induce ecstasy.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Marvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Marvel">Marvel</a> has Mutant Growth Hormone, or MGH. It induces a temporary genetic shift in the user, giving them superpowers. It also fucks you up good.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>, there is a drug to give immortality to humans made by killing and harvesting glands of a sapient alien race, the Stookies, that have heart attacks at the slightest things (similar to fainting goats). Naturally, stookie glanding is completely illegal and people who deal in it are dealt with in Dredd's normal manner (most of them wind up dead). So do most of the Stookies he's trying to save. Stookie glands are so addictive, that the symptoms of coming off them involves rapid ageing.
<ul><li> Umpty is a candy which is simply so extremely delicious that anyone who eats it develops an instant psychological addiction to it and will do anything to gain more Umpty to eat.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, one of Vandal Savage's businesses is selling Velocity-9, a drug that gives the users superspeed. And then they burn out and die.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> titles:
<ul><li> D.M.N. is a drug that <em>turns the user into a demon</em>. It was created by Lord Satanus.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThirdKryptonian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThirdKryptonian">The Third Kryptonian</a></em>, Karsta Wor-Ul grows alien medicinal plants in his yard. She smokes a Bolenthi herb for pain relief, but some human teenagers stole and smoked her crops. It made them super-strong... and crazy.
</li></ul></li><li> Adam Warren's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> universe has several fantastic drugs, this being a future filled with transhuman technology. Wardrugs are implants that inject a tranquilizing cocktail into the blood after a serious injury. At one point Kei gets her leg half blown off, and starts "glanding" Wardrugs. She identifies "no-shock" and "happy juice," the latter of which makes her very giggly. There is also a chemweapon called "Proust-in-a-Can," which places the victim into a coma while they are locked into re-experiencing a distant memory.
</li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em> is basically the adventures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, there are several "future drugs" that protagonist Spider Jerusalem ingests, injects, and generally crams into every orifice. As noted in the Quotes section, among these is Mechanics, a nanotech drug that slowly turns your body into a cyborg system that turns addiction into a protocol.
<ul><li> When Spider moves into an apartment, he finds his <em>appliances</em> are drug addicts. Someone went to the trouble of developing a drug that an AI can have plugged into its mainframe.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvisibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvisibles">The Invisibles</a></em> has the "Key" series of drugs (Key 17, Key 23) that cause people to hallucinate and mistake words for the thing they describe. Having been told he was infected with a flesh-eating virus, someone is tortured by being shown a hand mirror with a post-it saying "diseased face"; a villain drops to her knees, sobbing with regret and begging forgiveness in front of a "world's greatest dad" mug; and one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> explodes when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BANGFlagGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BANGFlagGun">a flag-gun saying "Bang!"</a> unfurls in front of him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099">Marvel's 2099</a> line of comics in the early-to-mid '90s had quite a few examples of this:
<ul><li> Rapture was a legal designer drug developed by (and exclusive to) the Alchemax corporation that would be distributed to employees in order to keep them loyal to the company. A "very high-powered, mind-expanding hallucinogen," it causes the user to feel perfectly calm and collected... unless he tries to fight the drug's effects, in which case it causes him to hallucinate wildly, "seeing monsters everywhere." It also bonds with the user's DNA in short order, becoming so addictive "you need it the way you need air to breathe." Geneticist Miguel O'Hara, who would become the Spider-Man of 2099, was slipped the drug by his boss when Miguel tried to quit the company. He tried to rid his system of Rapture by rewriting his own genetic code using a stored file of his genome which he'd been using for experiments. Things didn't go as planned, and Miguel ended up with spidery traits in his DNA as a result.
</li><li> A similar drug, Rhapsody, was mentioned in an issue of X-Men 2099, in which it was revealed that the Synthia corporation secretly laced its food products with the drug, so that consumers would become addicted to eating Synthia food, at the expense of their health.
</li><li> Chameleon 2099 turned out to be a drug rather than a person, which not only manipulated a user's DNA, it allowed him to shapeshift (either partially or completely) into whatever animal happened to suit the user's mindset at the time of taking the drug. Users have been seen assuming the characteristics of animals like bulls, mice, felines, and dogs. It was an Alchemax-designed drug, but "unstable even by their standards" to the point that users often die painfully from the toll it takes on their systems.
</li><li> Chain is one of the most illegal of drugs in that era. In 2099 A.D. Genesis, it was revealed that the legislation on Chain had been upgraded from a "thirty-year stretch" (being physically aged by three decades) for possession to a "death penalty" for even having it on one's person. In his only appearance in the 2099 comics, the Daredevil of that era planted a dime bag of Chain on a drug dealer just to make sure the dealer never pushes drugs again. At the time, the dealer had been peddling a drug laced with "a rider chemical" that "causes communicable sterility". In short, Daredevil signed a drug dealer's death warrant for trying to "kill all birth in Downtown."
</li><li> Perhaps the most bizarre example was found in X-Nation #1. The main characters, a group of teenagers living at the Xavier Institute for Indigent Children, had slipped away to a bar and try a unique hallucinogen: milk. They attached diodes to their foreheads; drinking milk stimulated their brains into producing bizarre hallucinations. But as one of them insisted, "'s really good f'r your bones an' teeeeeth."
</li></ul></li><li> A shot of "buz", from an early issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a></em>, is one hundred percent addictive and provides all the nutrition an adult needs in one day. A villain uses it to subjugate and rule his entire city.
</li><li> Taduki from the <em>Allan Quartermain</em> novels (see below) also features in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em>, in which it's a thinly disguised version of opium, and Allan is hooked on it. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> Century: 1969</em> also has the drug of choice in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">Swinging London</a> as "Tadukic Acid" (or "taddies") instead of LSD.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TopTen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TopTen">Top 10</a></em> universe has several strange drugs.
<ul><li> "Goose Juice", i.e. mongoose blood, that (in reference to fifth-string <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a> super The Whizzer) induces super speed
</li><li> "Pixie Dust", that gives hallucinations so vivid that other people can see them, usually of brightly coloured pixies.
</li><li> A more dramatic version is xenite, which is basically amphetamine, but laced with a number of radioactive compunds which enabled it to affect even generally invulnerable supers.
</li></ul></li><li> In a further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> example, goloka root in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong">Tom Strong</a></em> increases human strength and intelligence when consumed regularly in small quantities, but has hallucinogenic effects if larger doses are taken.
</li><li> So numerous in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AmericanFlagg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AmericanFlagg">American Flagg!</a></em> that the <em>Comic Book Drug Reference</em> has <a class="urllink" href="http://politedissent.com/cbdr_d.html">a separate appendix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> dedicated to fictional drugs appearing in the series.
</li><li> In the "Five Years Later" version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, a character is revealed to be taking ProFem, a drug that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">turns men into women</a>, but the change is only maintained if the drug is taken regularly.
</li><li> The mutant celebrity team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XStatix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XStatix">X-Statix</a> had several custom drugs that helped to support their ultra-self-destructive lifestyles. U-Go Girl, for instance, took at least two different stimulants to counteract the extreme fatigue that her powers caused her, one of which was Kick as featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen">New X-Men</a></em>. There was also a drug that many on the team used to instantly purge themselves of alcohol so that they could go straight from parties to missions. It was implied that this latter drug had terrible effects with long-term use, but since the average lifespan of an X-Statix member was only a few years at best, nobody really worried about it.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen">New X-Men</a></em>, Xavier and his staff had to contend with Hypercortisone D (or "Kick"), a highly addictive stimulant that boosted mutant abilities. Emma Frost described the high as making one feel both "angelic and violently insane for five hours." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was eventually revealed that Kick was actually small portions of the sentient microbial colony Sublime, and allowed Sublime to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">influence or even control</a> its users' actions.</span>
</li><li> The magic potion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> is mostly just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a>, but is played like this in a few stories where it's funnier. For instance, the druid who gives it to the villagers is named Getafix, athletes at the Olympic Games are banned from taking it, and in one story it's explicitly and repeatedly referred to as 'the dope' by a Roman trying to steal it. The official site also implies that it has some mild psychological effects, basically inducing childlike thought in people who drink it—explaining Obelix's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage">strange personality</a> and why even the more shrewd Gauls really enjoy beating people up on potion.
</li><li> In a few issues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Knuckles the Echidna</a></em> a substance called Lemon Sundrop Dandelion was hidden in hot dogs at an amusement park. After eating the dog most characters would begin tripping balls, though Charmy's friend Mello died of an overdose and Charmy himself almost did as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllSuperheroesMustDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllSuperheroesMustDie">All Superheroes Must Die</a></em> has 90s, which apparently causes people injected with it to explode after 90 seconds.
</li><li> In a March 2015 story arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flare">Flare</a> encountered Darkdust, which apparently turns people into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Pouvoirpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Pouvoirpoint">Pouvoirpoint</a></em>: various drugs with psychedelic effects are inhaled using a narghile, including a narcotic from Venus called <em>PXL</em> (which literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pixellation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pixellation">pixilates</a> you), and <em>Demoulax</em>, which plunges the main character into highly hallucinatory dreams.
<ul><li> During New Year's Eve, pills called <em>En-fêtes</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyMustGetStoned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyMustGetStoned">are available at the buffet</a>, producing mild effects on the speech bubbles spoken by the characters (one will have reversed text, another will have hairy speech bubbles...).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Undertown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Undertown">Undertown</a></em>, <em>sugar</em> is treated like a drug. Eating too much of it causes people to hallucinate and it might be addictive on some level. The first volume even features a "sugar bar" which seems to function somewhere between a normal bar and an opium den.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Monstress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Monstress">Monstress</a></em> has Dream Tar, a fantasy analogue to opium which causes feelings of euphoria and seeing visions. Unfortunately, Arcanics are easily hooked on it. Because it was the cats that introduced the plant that is the main ingredient for Dream Tar, many Arcanics hate cats, believing the cats had done so to purposely hook them on the drug.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewUltimates">All-New Ultimates</a></em>: There is a drug lab ran by former employees of Roxxon. They made a drug that give people superpowers, but it is untested, and more often than not it gives useless or harming super powers. The lab was then seized by a street gang, the Serpent Skulls.

A telltale way to know that someone is stoned on smurfnip is that the whites of their eyes turn green. Pixie dust, as seen with a Smurf in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> and normal Vanity in "The High Cost Of Smurfing" inhaling it, is their analog to cocaine. There's also psychelium, a drug that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentDrugEnforcement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentDrugEnforcement">the Psyches are forced to use</a> to inhibit emotional expression. There's glowberries, which gives hallucinations when eaten along with a sour stomach and a bad case of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">smurfarrhea</a>".

The third is called "Virgin's Blood," which is stated to be a dilute form of MDMA dissolved in a red syrup containing various aphrodisiacs, and is often taken with other drugs (such as Celestial Blue) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight">inhibit sexual performance</a>.

By chapter 20, she gets over her addiction (unlike Pinkie Pie, who was also addicted to these), flushing down her remaining Party Time Mint-als (which were a lot, mind you) down the toilet.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> fic <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3362802/1/One-Thing-Leads-to-Another">One Thing Leads to Another,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Beast Boy and Raven discover during their first time sleeping together that Raven's magic can create an empathic link between them during sex.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OriginStory">Origin Story</a></em>, it turns out that the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers">Carol Danvers</a> is willingly working with Hydra as they subvert the American government is because they hooked her on a drug that was manufactured from the Puppetmaster's mind-control clay, and the addiction is so strong she's willing to sell out her friends and her country if doing so guarantees her access to the drug.
</li><li> Street drugs derived from Night Howler serum are very common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> fanfics. For instance, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TakeAStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TakeAStand">Take a Stand</a></em> "Morrigan" is a performance enhancer used in illegal pit fights.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RWBYAlternate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RWBYAlternate">RWBY Alternate</a></em>, there are drugs laced with dust (as in, the fictional substance used in <em>RWBY</em>). These are illegal everywhere except for Atlas, who legalized them in an attempt to boost the economy. These drugs are largely illegal precisely because they often lead to people exploding due to dust poisoning. A lot of these drugs are practical rather than recreational, such as "gills", which allow people to hold their breath underwater for longer periods, and "floaties", which allow people to jump higher.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BackToZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BackToZero">Back To Zero</a></em>, there is an illegal recreational drug made of Pokémon stun spore. Some people also smoke elements of plant Pokémon, such as Oddish leaves.

Taking hits from Nygma's machine is apparently quite addictive. The Riddler himself spends hours on a stylized throne shaped like "The Thinker", jittering like a coke fiend as he sucks up more energy.
</li><li> The hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless">Limitless</a></em>, a hapless writer with no initiative, receives a mysterious drug called NZT that turns him into a genius.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Snowpiercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Snowpiercer">Snowpiercer</a></em> has Kronol, an industrial waste that two of the protagonists as well as some of the upper class rave about in a world where even cigarettes are extinct. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because of its highly flammable properties, the stuff is also used to make a makeshift bomb</span>.

One of those drugs is, apparently, called "Everlast". It is implied that making men last longer is not the only effect, though—they seem to also act as aphrodisiac.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCourtsOfTheMorning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCourtsOfTheMorning">The Courts of the Morning</a></em>, part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s scheme depends on a drug called "asturas", derived from a rare plant found in a particular South American mountain range, which has exactly the properties required to make the plot work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, Muellen, the mother of the protagonist, is drugged most of the time. One of her favourites is "dreamroot", but she also has other plants in her garden. It's what happens when a botanist becomes severely depressed—she was a well-adjusted, but delicate soul in Ward's childhood. Then her abusive husband became too much to bear, and she started seeking solace in the psychoactive plants in her garden. She doesn't seem to be quite there even when she's not drugged, having effectively fled reality and turned herself into a full-time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>.
</li><li> Kef from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AncillaryJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AncillaryJustice">Ancillary Justice</a></em>.

If used for the latter it can be incredibly habit forming and addictive.
</li><li> From the beginning, drugs figure among the limitations on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni">Deryni</a> powers in the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatherineKurtz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatherineKurtz">Katherine Kurtz</a>:
<ul><li> <em>Merasha</em> is a drug that severely disables Deryni, with nausea, dizziness, blackouts, and severely disorienting psychedelic effects on the brain that prevent the drugged person from concentrating (a requirement for the use of Deryni powers). In ordinary humans, it only produces a mild drowsiness. In earlier times, Deryni were exposed to it as part of their training; after the persecutions began, knowledge of it, like so much else, became fragmented and contradictory. It does appear quite frequently in <em>The Deryni Chronicles</em> and <em>The Histories of King Kelson</em>, and arrangements are made to expose Kelson and Dhugal to it in a controlled setting so they can learn to recognize it and mitigate its effects.
</li><li> The climax of <em>High Deryni</em> involves the use of two such drugs, though they are not explicitly named. One is a <em>very</em> slow poison (said to take <strong>at least a day</strong> to kill) which also prevents Deryni from using their powers, and the other is an "antidote" which slows the initial symptoms of the first but hastens its end result

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series, male and female magic users (called channelers) find the very act of casting magic from the Source is very addictive. So much so that many channelers only use magic when necessary, since it is easy to "burn out", permanently severing your ability to do magic, if you try to pull in too much magic.
</li><li> The first book in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane">Diane Duane</a>'s <em>Space Cops</em> series, "Mindblast", is centered around the spread of Hyper 2, an intelligence enhancing (and lethal) drug complete with full chemical name and a lengthy description of how the drug worked.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Tingle</a>, a "soft" stimulant from <em>The Fluted Girl</em>. Aside making you giddy, it also gives munchies for sweets. And it's apparently legal.
</li><li> Whatever Effy is, Alvarez in <em>Pump Six</em> trips out on it so hard, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">Inner Monologue</a> turns into barely coherent rambling, as he tries to make sense out of his hallucinations and task at hand. There are other people going in the drug-inducted bliss <em>non-stop</em>, but since the whole society is on a verge of a complete collapse, nobody cares - and those who <em>do</em> care drug themselves out specifically to forget. One of the signs of taking it are bulging, hazy eyes.
</li><li> Mez from <em>Pasho</em> is some sort of alcohol distilled by Jai tribals from a poisonous desert shrub. They never purify it fully, as the small dose of the toxin cause euphoria and may give hallucinations. But be it poorly distilled, in large amount or with regular intake and it's lethal. This is a plot point, too.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MatthewSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MatthewSwift">The Minority Council</a>, Pixie Dust is a super-addictive drug that enhances the magical talent of the user ten fold. It's also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> made out of the ashes of previous users, as prolonged use turns you into dust</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> introduced red sand, implied to be cocaine that's been exposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">element zero</a> radiation. Gets the user high, and also lets them temporarily use a weakened form of biotic powers. It started popping up in the main game series soon afterward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> also features a handful of drugs
<ul><li> <em>Milk of the poppy</em>—basically opium, which is usually used to deal with pain, but can also get addictive. Gregor Clegane takes it to deal with his chronic headaches, and seems to guzzle it like water.
<ul><li> In "A Feast for Crows", this comes back to bite Clegane <em>hard</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His excessive use of the stuff has given him such a high tolerance for it that it's practically useless against the pain of a poisoned spear wound to his abdomen.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Sourleaf</em>—a mild drug apparently similar to tobacco that, when chewed, stains the user's teeth bloody red.
</li><li> <em>Shade of the evening</em>—a psychotropic drug used by warlocks. It turns the user's lips blue.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerdidoStreetStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerdidoStreetStation">Perdido Street Station</a></em> probably had several, but the plot relevant one was Dreamshit. Which is made up of dreams made physical and sawdust. A dose knocks the user unconscious while they experience all the dreams (of all "genres") semi-simultaneously. It's very intense but the hangover doesn't last long.
</li><li> Soma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> is the ideal recreational drug. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> drug of the same name, but it's clearly not the same substance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AScannerDarkly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AScannerDarkly">A Scanner Darkly</a></em> had Substance-D, sometimes abbreviated as "D" or "Slow Death." It was a powerful hallucinogen with some schizophrenic side-effects.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a> novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeStigmataOfPalmerEldritch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeStigmataOfPalmerEldritch">The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</a></em> had Can-D, another hallucinogen. You might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">sense a theme...</a>
</li><li> The third book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce">Spaceforce</a></em> series, <em>Oblivion</em>, centres around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a> of the same name. Oblivion induces a lucid dreaming state in users, allowing them to experience a fantasy scenario of their choice—innocent or less so. Unfortunately, it can also cause users to return to the dream state without warning and at random days or weeks later, often causing fatal accidents.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em> series has a lot, with names like Zoner (a marijuana <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalCounterpart">Fictional Counterpart</a>), and Zeus (a PCP analogue). On the other hand it has Whore&amp;Rabbit which are aphrodisiacs that only work on women and are treated like an even more evil version of Rohypnol, but the effects are vastly different. And then there's Funk; it seems to live somewhere in the downer category of drugs but has really insane side effects including basically turning someone into an albino complete with vision issues. Some of the drugs are analogous and some aren't really classifiable in the usual categories.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> novels had "Bliss", a brown powder that literally made you believe you were God, could supposedly get you hooked just by looking at it &amp; would cause the user to become suicidally depressed for decades after coming down, which is probably what made it so addictive. Also, Better than Life, which was a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a> in the books rather than the more innocuous artificial reality video game of the TV series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PartnerShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PartnerShip">PartnerShip</a></em> has several designer drugs, including Blissto and Seductron.
</li><li> Fictional drugs abound in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NakedLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NakedLunch">Naked Lunch</a></em> by William Burroughs: Black Meat, Mugwump Juice, etc.
</li><li> AUM from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">Illuminatus!</a></em> trilogy, alongside a whole pharmacy of real drugs.
</li><li> The novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> (and cut portions of the film) had Maohee, a hallucinogen that causes a large group to experience the visions of a single person (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">problems arise</a> when a worker takes it). Drinking water erases any memory of the drug whatsoever.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreNorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreNorton">Andre Norton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SargassoOfSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SargassoOfSpace">Sargasso of Space</a></em>, she described a drug called crax seed, apparently chewed like tobacco (there's a reference to someone having spit out a crax cud). While high on the stuff, you're lots faster, stronger, and smarter than normal. When you come down, you come down <strong>hard</strong>: "What occurred to them later was not pretty at all."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster">Alan Dean Foster</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> setting includes Bloodhype, which must have <em>fantastic</em> marketing to ever sell, given that <em>one</em> dose is addictive—and withdrawal is <em>fatal</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> The troll drug Slab, which is ammonium chloride cut with radium and is a hallucinogen—but only if you're a troll. It also makes their brains melt.
</li><li> There's a long list of drugs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em>, some of which are genuine street names for real drugs, some of which sound like they <em>might</em> be street names for real drugs, and a couple of which are established as variants on Slab in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em>. These variants include Scrape (called so because you <em>scrape</em> the remains of Slab you have and cook it with pigeon droppings and alcohol. Also, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel), and Slide, which seems to be an ersatz for crack and PCP.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em> introduces Crystal Slam, an even-worse narcotic that's implied to literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">make trolls' heads explode</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> series had nitrolabe, thionite, bentlam, and hadive. However, opium and heroin were still in circulation.
<ul><li> Most of the stuff listed is comparable to drugs on the streets today (bentlam is described in decent detail in <em>Gray Lensman</em> and comes off as pretty tame: basically snuff that conks you out). Then there's thionite: the big one, <em>so</em> dangerous that trafficking in it <em>is a capital offense</em>. With thionite, the user experiences the illusion of the gratification of their every desire, however noble or base. The catch is that while the psychotropic effects are tolerance-inducing (and so incredibly addictive that the one-time user can be traumatised for months), the physiological effects are not—and eventually the increasing dose required by the addict to have the same psychological effect is lethal. Always. And the effective dose is <em>tiny</em>: in <em>First Lensman</em>, a single dose was described as several tiny granules in a nasal capsule.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves">House of Leaves</a></em>, one of the writers/editors, Johnny Truant, of the story within a story claims in one of the footnotes/journal entries that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he visited an old friend, who was a doctor, on one of his journeys. During his visit Johnny told the doctor about night terrors and screaming in his sleep, the doctor gave him a "yellow pill". Afterwords the dreams stopped and slept more peacefully. It was suddenly revealed that the Journal entries were faked by Johnny to make himself believe that his life was better than it actually was in the duration of the writing, painfully subverting the trope.</span>
</li><li> A full list of fictional drugs found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> would take up most of this page. The most important one is Spice, aka Melange. Melange is is highly desired not for recreational purposes, but because of its geriatric (life-extending) properties, and its ability to trigger precognizance and other advanced mental abilities in specially-trained individuals - abilities that are necessary for safe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> within the universe. Because of this, and the fact that it cannot be artificially synthesized, the entire economy of the <em>Dune</em> universe is centered around it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that it's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesoptinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesoptinum">an analogy for the importance of petrol/crude oil in the real world</a>.

Some or all of these are probably real drugs under fantasy names (poppy is also mentioned), but we'll never know.
</li><li> Pierce's other series, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em> books, has "dragonsalt" in <em>Magic Steps</em>.

Similarly, several of the pilots find themselves obligated to use "stims" (the all-purpose sci-fi version of amphetamine) to keep up with their round-the-clock responsibilities, and suffer severe physical and emotional damage as a result. There was also a plant on New Caprica that was made into cigarettes that was smoked by Adama and Roslin, among others. From the way the effects were described, and that they already had an equivalent plant to Earth tobacco, it was assumed by many to be some form of cannabis (they also referred to it as New Caprica <em>weed</em>!!).
</li><li> "Stims" were used before <em>Galactica</em>, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, with similar realistic effect. The abusing character, Dr. Franklin (yes, a medical doctor), starts out simply using them as necessary to keep up with his work, then grows addicted, almost kills a patient, gets investigated by Security Chief Garibaldi (a recovering alcoholic who knows whereof he speaks), leaves his job, suffers withdrawal, and eventually almost dies in an attempt to "find himself."

Pure meth, as the "blue sky" of the show is claimed to be, is usually transparent like glass in real life.
</li><li> Season 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> focuses quite a bit on Willow's addiction to casting magic spells.
<ul><li> Season 5 has vampires feeding on drug-using humans, including Buffy's boyfriend Riley. It may or may not be the Orpheus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>

Unfortunately, if you take enough of it your bones become very tasty to a terrifying type of demon called an ahuizotl.
</li><li> In addition to the drugs mentioned under Literature, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> the series also has several examples:
<ul><li> Outrazone (prounced vaguely like "ultrazone" in a mock-Canadian accent) is a chemical gunk that is apparently marijuana for mechanoids.
</li><li> A second season episode mentions a powerful hallucinogenic mushroom species native to Titan (one of the moons of Saturn).
</li><li> Apparently, by the time before Arnold Rimmer caused Red Dwarf's fatal accident, humanity had learned to create a form of gin out of marijuana. They called it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Marijuana Gin</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Wraith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> feed on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">life force</a> of humans. To keep the victim from dying imediatly, the Wraith inject an enzyme into their prey. This enzyme can be harvested from dead Warith and used as a narcotic, giving the user incredible strength and stamina, but also making them very paraniod.

Which makes one wonder what the hell is he providing, unicorn meat?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, "The Game". A really lame video game with the power to seduce the entire crew's brains, to the point of <em>unthinking loyalty</em> to the game's creators, leaving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> and his new friend to save the day.
<ul><li> <em>TNG</em> also came up with synthehol, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> version of this trope. It's a replacement for alcohol in beverages that can (apparently) be flushed from the system quite rapidly if you're called back to duty while in Ten Forward. The science book <em>Life Signs: The Biology of Star Trek</em> went so far as to figure a way how it could work: broken down by adrenaline when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert">Red Alert</a> sounds.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> explains that synthehol was originally invented by the Ferengi for use in scams: a Ferengi con artist would invite the mark to drink, giving the mark their strongest booze while the Ferengi only drinks synthehol and fakes being drunk out of his gourd. But they quickly realized that there was a huge market for an alcohol substitute that lets people get as drunk as they like, but also lets them sober up as soon as they need to and skip the hangover. So just selling synthehol to everybody was an easier way to make money.
</li></ul></li><li> "Symbiosis" has an entire planet addicted to a drug called "felicium". It used to be legitimate medicine to treat a deadly plague; the plague is long since gone, but the addiction remains.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, the Jem'Hadar are addicted to the milky substance ketracel-white so much that they die without it.
<ul><li> It's not just an addictive drug, it's their only means of nourishment past puberty.
</li><li> And note: This is an <em>engineered</em> dependency; ketracel-white, in addition to providing complete sustenance, also provides essential chemicals their bodies need for normal function. The Jem'Hadar were essentially genetically crafted by the Founders to be their vision of perfect soldiers; the dependency ensures absolute loyalty.
</li><li> Not just the loyalty of the Jem'Hadar, but the Vorta who are the Jem'Hadar's commanding officer. If a Jem'Hadar doesn't get his Ketrecel-White, he will descend into a mindless berserk rage in his final moments of life, killing anything in sight. The Jem'Hadar, who have expressed disdain for the Vorta, though muted by the Founders establishing Vorta as higher in rank, would overpower a Vorta in a heartbeat when they have their senses. No Ketracel just makes it more violent. The Founders figured that the the reasons for the lack of Ketracel-white supplies would be one of a few issues: The Jem'Hadar are no longer loyal (in which case they'd starve them out), the Vorta commander was no longer loyal (in which case, he would face what anyone who opposes the Founders face: Death by Jem'Hadar) or the enemy tried to cut off the supply of Ketrecel-White, which would almost have to put the enemy close to Jem'Hadar in withdrawal (and the Vorta failed their mission). Of course, the one time we see something close to this occurring (The Ketracel-White wasn't completely gone, but they had to ration out to such small dosages that withdrawal symptoms had started to show), the Vorta in command realizes what is about to happen and surrenders on condition of protection from enraged Jem'Hadar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> introduces trellium-D, a substance which is harmless to most humanoids but screws up the brains of Vulcans, making them uncontrollably emotional, paranoid, and violent. After being exposed to it once, T'Pol develops an addiction and starts injecting herself with small amounts of trellium so she can experiment with the emotions that it helps her unlock.

V-blood, V-juice, or V, is apparently more fun than every other recreational drug ever. It also increases the libido, the senses, and gives limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>. It even has medicinal value for those who are wounded. Too bad vampires as a whole don't take kindly to the commoditization of their life essence.
<ul><li> It also creates adverse withdrawal symptoms if one gets addicted. Jason's went static, and he became more aggressive and desperate. It also gave him a boner from hell when he overdosed on it, and had to have the blood painfully removed from his penis.
</li><li> Don't forget that taking the stuff will create a mystical bond between the user and the vampire it came from, allowing them to feel each others emotions, making the user sexually attracted to the vampire in question, and at least to an extent allowing the vampire to keep track of the user, though the extent of how well this works is unclear.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> has Orpheus, a drug primarily used by supernatural beings which is so named because it sends the user into potentially hellish visionary journeys. Faith injects herself with it and allows Angelus to bite her, even though it is potentially fatal to humans, to incapacitate him so that he can be captured and resouled. Most of the episode "Orpheus" depicts their resulting shared hallucination.
</li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobocopTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobocopTheSeries">Robocop The Series</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx">Lexx</a></em> called its Fantastic Marijuana "gongslanger root".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has a couple of examples:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> "Nightmare of Eden" has the Fourth Doctor and Romana II hunting smugglers and dealers of "vraxoin", an incredibly powerful narcotic which appears to cause instant addiction with only a single dose.
</li><li> "Gridlock" dealt with a future human culture with smart drugs that could produce single specific emotions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The invention of a "Bliss" drug led to the collapse of civilization</span>, resulting in humanity being forced to live in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">horrible traffic</a> for generations.

</li><li> The Trolls of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTenthKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTenthKingdom">The 10th Kingdom</a></em> have "dwarf moss" that makes you see fairies. However, the real example is the Troll King's invisibility shoes, which give their wearer such a great sense of power that they become more and more obsessed with wearing them all the time. Even touching them seems to be enough to begin the process; as soon as Virginia does so, she hides them in her backpack, thinks of nothing else, and acts increasingly paranoid, even clutching the shoes like Linus's security blanket. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Wolf (twice!) when he claims "magic is very nice, but it's very easy to get addicted", and later tells Virginia she is "hopelessly addicted to those shoes and I'm not too far behind!" Whether this is meant to be a parody or an object lesson is never made clear, but it certainly plays out with extreme hilarity.
<ul><li> Of course, there are literary antecedents for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">some sort of invisibility equipment acting as a drug</a>.
</li><li> A later example would be the scene in the Deadly Swamp, where Tony and Virginia eat the magic mushrooms, drink the swamp water, and sleep (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">after being explicitly told not to</a>) and hallucinate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">bizarre dream</a>. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ProcolHarum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ProcolHarum">Procol Harum</a>'s "Whiter Shade of Pale" plays throughout is of course only window dressing for setting the scene
<ul><li> To <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">hammer the point home</a>, the soundtrack piece which accompanies both this scene and parts of the magic shoe shenanigans is entitled "Addicted to Magic".

<ul><li> There's also freslin, a form of Space Ecstasy, which turns out to be made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">"milking" the glands of sentient beings</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The survivors of the show <em>Whoops</em> found a mutated berry bush that make you high by smashing it on your forehead.
</li><li> Vampires' blood-drinking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em> is an addiction, not a biological necessity, and comes complete with painful withdrawal symptoms and a 12-step program (well, for a while anyway.)
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS">American remake</a> treats blood the same for vampires, but adds possession for ghosts, who treat having a new physical body as a high due to the renewed ability to use their senses again. The negative side effects include getting stuck in the person's body and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later having your own memories of life and death become part of that person's memories, driving them insane.

It was destructive and often fatal to humans, which meant Cole and Mel had to put the producer out of business.
</li><li> Dealing in kassa, an addictive corn-like grain, is a major source of income for the Lucian Alliance in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>.

</li><li> There's also the euphoric effects of going into a sarcophagus, which gives Daniel Jackson delusions of grandeur and causes severe withdrawal symptoms when he's made to stop.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrassEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrassEye">Brass Eye</a></em> notoriously aired an episode on drugs which highlighted the danger of a new designer drug called "cake." This came in the form of a giant yellow pill, and potential effects included slowing down time so a second lasts an hour, a bloating condition known as "Czech neck" and, in one case, a girl who "cried all the water out of her body." What made this example particularly controversial was that several real-life celebrities were asked to give their opinions and one MP even asked a question about it in Parliament. Suffice it to say that he didn't see the funny side, and subsequent repeats of the episode include an apology.

It's so addictive that anyone injected with it becomes borderline feral and will do absolutely anything to get another dose, and if they go too long without dosing up the withdrawal symptoms will kill them.

The drug gives the user <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes">all white eyes</a> and an incredible high, making the user feel stronger and faster. It's also highly addictive. Beka's father was an addict and her uncle once exposed her to the drug, leading to her taking large doses of Flash later on when she needed to perform some particularly taxing piloting.

This is accomplished by taking a personal item belonging to the deceased and gleaning DNA from it. The DNA is distilled, refined, cloned millions of times and converted into a liquid. The scent given off by the liquid triggers the user's sense memories and causes them to imagine their loved one. The experience is driven by the user's subconscious, meaning that it can bring unresolved emotions to the surface. S is highly addictive and can lead to insanity if the user overdoses. Dr. Seward recommends inhaling only one drop per session and no more than two sessions per day.

Her grandson Randy Atwater used traces of the oil on the herbs in her garden to create a drug called Blink. He then sent cookies laced with Blink to Tom and Diana in order to thank them for saving his grandmother's life by uncovering the promicin scandal. Tom had visions of his late father Mitch, with whom he had a very poor relationship, while Diana had visions of her ex-fiancé Josh Sandler, who cheated on her two weeks about the wedding. Although Randy's intentions were basically good, Erika Lundgren and two other Blink users could not cope with their hallucinations and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>.

In-universe, these are basically a mix of stimulants, painkillers, and more exotic chemicals intended to keep a soldier going for as long as possible before dying. Usually in a berserk rage (the most common name for drugs inducing this condition being "frenzon").

<ul><li> The most prolific users of combat drugs are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Eversor Assassins</a>, who are turned into monsters with them and sent to destroy someone.

</li><li> Combat drugs aside, there are several recreational drugs that exist in the background as well. The most ubiquitous being the narcotic lho-sticks, which are smoked like a cigarette and apparently an opiate. Others include obscura, gladstones, and grinweed. Another example that plays the trope much straighter is flects, which are warp-saturated bits of broken glass, "used" simply by looking into them; keep in mind that since they are tainted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">warp</a>, flects are a much more insidious example than most others on this page

<ul><li> In various sourcebooks for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>, there are examples of magically created drugs, from the enchanted tabs of LSD, to various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Progenitor</a> created drugs that are intended to have effects ranging from making the user aware of all things within a set area, more likely to believe certain realities, or become completely incapable of feeling emotions. Of course, this being Mage, players are able to make any kind of magical fantasy drug they want. Crack that turns you into fire? Go for it! Mushrooms that makes any hallucinations real? Of course!

</li><li> The <em>Mythologies</em> sourcebook for <em>Requiem</em> actually introduces a drug specifically for vampires—Solace.

Taking regular infusions of Vitae gives you a ton of energy and makes you immune to poisons and allows you to ignore a lot of damage, but unless you have a very expensive implant that's only available to loyal Progenitus employees and carefully regulates the Vitae that durability comes at the cost of your sanity.

Two are specifically noted to have been adapted into street drugs. "Harmony" improves emotional stability but is spiked with powerful antidepressants that cause a strong bounce-back effect when it wears off, encouraging users to buy another dose. While "Boost" permanently increases intelligence, but most dealers don't tell their buyers that it's permanent and sell them addictive placebos or blackmail them after the first dose.

It also includes a line about the richest people being the only ones who can afford drugs tailored to their physiologies.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series features a wide array of drugs, from Mentats that boost your brainpower to Jet, a stimulant extracted from Brahmin manure with severe withdrawal symptoms. Also Buffout (short-term boost to physical strength and endurance) and Psycho (increased damage resistance). The player character can become addicted to any or all of them; certain traits taken at character creation can affect how effective and addictive they are.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> had to change the name of a drug morphine to 'Med-X' in order to keep distribution in certain countries. A cry against 'censorship' went out, but real life drug names were never part of the <em>Fallout</em> franchise before, and Bethesda pretty much designed them to act like magic potions anyway, and this one in particular doesn't realistically simulate morphine. Also, in <em>Fallout 3</em>, a Ghoul comes up with a way to come up with a drug that can actually affect his kind. Ghouls barely feel anything from Jet, so he cooks up a way to turn it into <em>Ultra</em>jet. Put simply, Ultrajet has serious and potentially permanent consequences on a human.
</li><li> Some products were addictive in some but not all games they showed up in. Ordinary Nuka-Cola, for instance, was addictive in the first two games and <em>Tactics</em> but not in <em>3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em> (granted, it was a rather benign addiction—all withdrawal did was tell you you craved another Nuka-Cola—and there <em>are</em> several references and allusions to it in <em>3</em>). The same is true for Radaway, though with a slightly harsher addiction and no mention at all in later games.

They're illegal, and supposedly have negative effects on some people (forunately, your character is not one of those unlucky people). Complete with messages warning parents about the dangers. Plus, they're only sold by cyborgs in dark alleys.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Indivisible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Indivisible">Indivisible</a></em>, the streets of Tai Krung City are being flooded with the drug Ohma. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs">Ohma was originally used in small doses by practitioners of ancient arts in special ceremonies to achieve a higher state of consciousness and furthur their connection to the gods</a>. Unfortunatly, Mara began selling the stuff to the masses for money, resulting in Ohma addicts litering the streets.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowWarrior2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowWarrior2">Shadow Warrior 2</a></em>, Compound 61 was created in a laboratory, designed to give people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs">insightful visions</a>. It was later "cut" with other drugs and sold on the streets as Shade, which is known to cause euphoria, mild hallucinations, anxiety release and dependency.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>
<ul><li> The series has a number of recurring fantastic drugs, <a class="urllink" href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Narcotics">a list can be found here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Additionally, there are a number of fantastic alcoholic beverages as well.
</li><li> Most prominently, there is Moon Sugar (a white crystalline powder similar to real world cocaine) and its derivative, Skooma. It can often be found in bandit and smuggler dens, and can be sold for a nice profit to less-than-scrupulous traders. A few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mods</a> allow you to produce Skooma out of raw Moon Sugar, which can then be sold for even more. Most honest merchants will refuse to barter with you if you have either substance on you, though you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">drop it on the ground</a>, conduct your business, and pick it right back up if you want. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiit race</a> is seen as particularly susceptible to Moon Sugar and Skooma addiction, thanks to how prevalent the substances are in their culture, though they also supposedly have a higher tolerance for Moon Sugar than other races because they ingest it in small amounts every day; in fact, Moon Sugar is such a common ingredient in their native cuisine that non-Khajiit are advised to exercise caution when eating Khajiiti food. In <em>Morrowind</em>, these substances can <em>only</em> be sold to Khajiiti traders.
</li><li> The Argonians, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a>, worship the Hist, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseTree">sapient</a> and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniscient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniscient">omniscient</a> trees native to their swampy homeland of Black Marsh. Young Argonians drink the sap of the Hist trees to grow, and the Hist can communicate with the Argonians via visions transmitted in the sap. However, if a non-Argonian drinks the sap, or if the sap is somehow tainted, it can result in extreme hallucinations and intense bloodlust. (This can be seen in the Fighters' Guild questline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>.)
</li><li> A fungus known only to grow in the armpits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">Giants</a> is said to be a powerful narcotic.

It is chewed by the native Dunmer for its energizing properties and can be brewed into Restore Fatigue potions, giving it similarities to real world coca leaves and tobaacco.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> adds Sleeping Tree Sap, an extract of a glowing tree that makes you feel healthy, but is a hallucinogenic that slows you down.
</li></ul></li><li> Black Lotus is mentioned in passing several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>—a backroom in the Cornet Inn suggest that it's an Opium Analog, and for a very mercantile city, Amn forbid the selling of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em>, the Sons of Samedi manufacture Loa Dust, which is popular amongst the potheads at college. Part of the Saints' campaign against the Sons is in figuring out how to make it themselves, then stealing the competition's market.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Liquid Sky</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Snatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Snatcher">Snatcher</a></em>, which was necessary since the game was made right in the middle of the 'War on Drugs' campaign.
</li><li> Narc plays an important role in from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Policenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Policenauts">Policenauts</a></em>. The game also which gives a shout out to the use of Liquid Sky in <em>Snatcher</em>. It is stated that the two places with the highest drug rates in the populated world are Beyond Coast and "America, where the War on Drugs is still being fought".
<ul><li> Narc is described as having "the addictiveness of heroin and the hallucinogenic effects and potency of LSD." That's because it mixes organically grown black poppy opium with a synthetic hallucinogenic drug.
</li><li> When one Frozener (engineered humans with synthetic white blood) takes NARC he is able to shrug off being shot 25 times like it's a minor inconvenience. He loses a lot of blood, but manages to make a full recovery soon after.
</li><li> One character in <em>Policenauts</em> has the ability to not even respond physically to being shot due to the anaesthetic effects of Narc, and the main ingredient is from poppies, so it's presumably more opiate than hallucinogen.
</li></ul></li><li> Nekoko's fairy dust in <em>Yume Miru Kusuri</em>.

Side effects include delusions, paranoia, dementia, obsessive behavior, hallucinations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">dry mouth</a> higher doses or exposure to large amounts of naturally occurring lyrium can cause overdose-like symptoms along the lines of brain damage and death.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">pure lyrium idol</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> is responsible <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for Bartrand and Meredith both going insane. The latter is a Templar, and thus <em>already</em> reliant on lyrium to power her anti-magic abilities.</span>
</li><li> Offhandedly mentioned is Aquae Lucidius, a liquor whose ingredients include <em>wyvern poison</em>. It's apparently popular among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Orlesian nobility</a> (including the Empress herself). According to Tallis, it'll make you see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkElephants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkElephants">purple dragons</a> for days. The codex entry has these testimonies:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"I feel confused but happy!" <br/>"It was as though my soul took wing and floated about my head." <br/>"I had a vision of my great-grandmother and found it oddly arousing." <br/>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">I can see through time!</a>"
</div></li><li> The nastier effects of lyrium usage are shown in even greater degree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. Cullen struggles throughout the game with lyrium withdrawal, since he stopped taking lyrium after leaving the Order. He also tries to discourage a Warrior Inquisitor from becoming a Templar since that means taking lyrium. And that's not getting into Red Lyrium, a far more potent variety <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which was used in the above-mentioned idol's creation.</span> As Varric puts it red lyrium is lyrium like a dragon is a lizard. Regular lyrium is only dangerous if it's ingested. Just being near red lyrium is dangerous enough, let alone consuming it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red lyrium is normal lyrium tainted by the Blight... which means that lyrium is technically alive, since minerals aren't affected by the Blight.</span> Complete DLC <em>The Descent</em> and you learn the truth: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lyrium <em>is</em> alive, as in it's the blood of the ancient and humongous Titans that lie dormant deep, <em>deep</em> underground.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Haze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Haze">Haze</a></em> has Nectar, which makes soldiers easier to control by concealing how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> they're in (and how much of that they're responsible for). Withdrawal is <em>really</em> bad.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em> has triptocaine, a drug that one of the main characters, Norman Jayden, is addicted to. It's up to the player whether he will use it or not.
<ul><li> Norman is only addicted to triptocaine because he abuses it to suppress the symptoms of another addiction he has: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">ARI</a>, his virtual reality sunglasses that can be very dangerous with overuse and <em>really</em> screw with your perception of reality. Near the end of the game, keeping them on too long will make his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfBlood">eyes bleed</a>, and further use will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">kill him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> has red sand, a derivative of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">element zero</a>. It gives the user temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">biotic powers</a>, or enhances them if the user is a biotic. Other effects are unknown but it's implied to be extremely addictive and causes nasty psychological side effects, making it a banned substance across nearly all of Citadel space. It's legal on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Illium</a> though, provided one has acquired a license to sell it.
<ul><li> Hallex, seen in Samara's loyalty mission, causes euphoria and heightened senses. It's probably one of many drugs that originate on alien worlds.
</li></ul></li><li> The city of Billion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave">Gungrave</a></em> is overrun with crime and a mysterious drug known only as "seed". It's highly addictive and gives the user increased resilience and strength, along with lowered inhibitions and euphoria. However, it eventually drives the user insane and leads to death. Turns out that seed is really <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> derived from a malevolent race of alien parasites whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">only reason to live is to reproduce by taking control of other lifeforms</a></span>. And it's used in the technology that brought the protagonist back from death and nearly all the enemies he fights throughout the series.
</li><li> Dream Leaf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em> is an iridescent tree leaf from a semi-sentient (?) tree that acts as a sedative and gives the user good dreams. Its is typically used is by old people and insomniacs. In war-torn Border Town, it is taken recreationally by those who want to dream of the good old days <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or by our heroes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">to access the Haures summon in the blocked-off part of town</a></span>. When the Dream Tree is under attack by the ghostly monster Sludge, its leaves instead induce nightmares.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has Bloodthistle, an herb that can only be taken by Blood Elves. When taken, it can increase spell power for ten minutes. On the other hand, it has a twenty minute 'withdrawal', which lowers your spirit. Oh, and it's outlawed in Shattrath City.
<ul><li> In a lore interview, the blood specialization of Death Knights apparently have blood that works like this, blood that heals their allies (blood tap and bloodworms being the most apparent) but is addictive if overused, causing dependency and withdrawal in a way similar to the ghouls of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Gothic">Gothic</a></em> series has swampweed. While it works mostly like marijuana in that it is smoked in joints and affects perception, magic users can benefit from its side effects to enter a trance-like state required for certain magical endeavours. In particular, one of the storyline quests in <em>Gothic 2</em> requires a priest of each of the three main gods of Myrtana to enter in this trance state with joints of swampweed to help the Eye of Innos regain its power.

Both episodes were very dark and laced with terrifying imagery, particularly the Splicer episode, which culminated with Batman defeating the bad guy by splicing him over and over again with different animals until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">villain</a> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown">Superpower Meltdown</a>.
