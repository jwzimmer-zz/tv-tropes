But the difference between him and your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">standard-issue loudmouth</a> is that he really <em><strong>IS</strong></em> that good, and when you need someone with his skills to save the day, he always comes through. So you have to concede that at least a <em>little</em> of his arrogance is justified  not enough to make you forget that he's got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks">social skills of a chainsaw</a>, but enough that you can tolerate his ego if that's what it takes to keep him around. Not that he can't ever be hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> of some kind. In particular, every Insufferable Genius constantly runs the risk of humiliation if they ever make a mistake  which they are more or less bound to do eventually, by simple probability theory.

</p><p>A lot of the time, in some way or another, the Insufferable Genius' inflated ego is merely a petty facade that compensates for any insecurities or shortcomings, perceived or otherwise. They could also be legitimately delusional and truly believe they're "above" everyone else. Occasionally, they might display <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">a personable and compassionate side</a> of them sometimes along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">a deep, dark secret</a> revealing why they're the way they are, in which case they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEgoHiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEgoHiddenDepths">Big Ego, Hidden Depths</a>. People having the right to boast about themselves doesn't automatically mean there's a reason to do so in such an overt manner, especially if their talents can indeed be backed up. Despite any justification, arrogance is usually indicative of weakness, immaturity, stupidity, poor character and the like; something an Insufferable Genius would be too proud <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">to realize</a>.

<ul><li> Ed may be a bit of a Deconstruction. As children, he and Al practiced alchemy and were prodigies at it, (probably because of their dad). When their mother died, they sought to do the unthinkable and try and bring her back. They paid <em>dearly</em> for it as Al lost his body and Ed his left leg before sacrificing his right arm to get get back Al's soul and bind it to a suit of armor. Both obtain alchemic knowledge beyond imagination, requiring no circles or seals for it (though Al initially doesn't have this as trauma blocked the memory at first.) Now seeking to return themselves to normal, they end up getting another tragic dose with the fate of Nina. Despite Ed's brash exterior, he knows that even with alchemy he is still human, and the inability to save even one little girl remains on his and Al's conscience for the rest of their lives, but help their character development.

Especially so in the novel, where more of his thoughts are shown, as well as extra dialogue displaying more aspects to his character (especially in regard to his sense of pride). Also, his pet peeve seems to be people calling him an amateur or hobbyist when it comes to Arm Slaves, as he'll very indignantly correct them that he's not an amateur - he's a "specialist."

He's also known to <em>himself</em> as that and often boasts of his brilliance while he's fighting. When he's outwitted or his plans otherwise go pear-shaped, he tends to flip out that his opponents have the effontry to be as smart as he is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em> the cast is largely filled with them to varying degrees. The three most obvious are probably Erina Nakiri, Subaru Mimasaka and Souma himself.
<ul><li> Erina Nakiri is probably the most obvious of them and is known as God's Tongue in the culinary world for her picky tastes and perfectionist attitude. Unfortunately, her arrogance is entirely warranted and further amplified by her just having terrible social skills in general. When tasting dishes as either part of her job or just because she can, she's able to make extremely detailed observations like noting someone cooked a single ingredient for several seconds too long, skipped a particular step in the cooking or at best noting exactly what steps someone took in cooking, what ingredients they used and most other things about the preparation.
</li><li> Subaru Mimasaka. He is a genuinely highly skilled and innovative cook with excellent technical skills, great attention to detail, and a great theoretical grounding. All in all, he is able to match several of the series' top players <em>within their special fields</em>. His only flaw is his personality, which is widely considered so vile that no kitchen would hire him. He is obsessed with winning cooking contests and does so by stalking his opponents, goading them into matches, stealing their recipes and improving on them just enough to win. Then, to cap it off, he rubs their faces in the fact that he could improve recipes they've spent their life perfecting enough to wipe the floor with them in days.
</li><li> Finally, Souma himself is generally pretty easy going, but he does start the series by taunting Erina so much that she gives him a failing grade on the exam out of irritation and wounded pride. Petty, but understandable. During his introduction to the student body, he scoffs at the lot of them, calls them a bunch of stepping stones to further his career and declares he'll never lose to mere students with no professional experience. A few chapters later he's booed as he enters his first cooking duel and hasn't the faintest idea why everyone is against him.

His self imposed isolation and attitude pisses most people who know him off, especially when he just does his own thing regardless of opinion. But he's just so <em>good</em> at everything he does, from sports to academics, that no one can really call him out in a way that matters to him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>: Tony Stark has been like this since his conception, though the actual strength of it depends on the writer.
<ul><li> The <em>Superior Iron Man</em> is basically Tony taking this trait <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Brainiac 5 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, particularly in the current reboot and the one after the "Zero Hour" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a>.
<ul><li> His ancestor, Vril Dox II of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LEGIONDCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LEGIONDCComics">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a>, has a pretty big head as well.
</li><li> Humorously, when three alternate Legions are brought together to face Superboy Prime, the three Brainiacs 5 bicker over which one of them should be the authority; None of them can stand any of the others (albeit for different reasons; One of them is distrustful of an older Brainiac 5 because he's never trusted any adults before and isn't about to get in the habit of it.)
</li><li> During The Final Night, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a>, the Legion found themselves trapped in the 20th Century, and Brainiac 5 and the aforementioned Lex Luthor were forced to work together to solve the problem of the Sun-Eater. A humorous moment came when Brainiac 5 complained degradingly about how "primitive" the 20th Century tech was. Luthor loudly proclaimed to the entire room, "Young man, you're so much more advanced then we primitive cavemen, surely you must have already solved our dilemma!" Brainiac 5 promptly shut up.
</li><li> One of the (surprisingly many) post-crisis reimaginings of the origins of Superman involves his first meeting (as Superboy) with the Legion, who have violated the laws of time and causality to meet him out of hero-worship. When he discovers this, Brainiac 5 delivers a pompous lecture about the possible effects this could have. One of the Legion 'innocently' challenges him to work out the exact odds of his disastrous predictions coming true, riling Brainiac 5 up so much that he immediately leaves to do just that — leaving Superboy to hang out with the other members of the Legion, which was, of course, the whole point.

Notably, he scoffs at Peter's lack of scientific advancements, despite knowing he invented the advanced web shooter tech when he was fifteen and has been too busy saving the world since then (often from Ock himself) to do much research. But nope, Ock's still "superior" to all other scientists.

Of course, this goes to her head as after Bubbles draws a rainbow, Blossom details what causes rainbows in a condescending manner. When she starts ragging on Buttercup and Bubbles on their battle techniques against Mojo Jojo, breaking down every movement to a science, even Mojo has had enough and challenges Blossom. Eventually at the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins">Mojo outwits Blossom</a>, with Bubbles' and Buttercup's blessings!

However, his spoiled and amoral upbringing with the League of Assassins made him arrogant and self-entitled, bringing him to blows with his adoptive brothers on multiple occasions when he insists that he's Bruce's rightful heir. Years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> have made him far more tolerable (and sometimes even cute, but he still won't hesitate to rub his skillset and intelligence in other people's faces when given the chance.

Unfortunately, <em>they know it</em>, and never miss a chance to brag about their achievements. As a result, they have almost no friends (not that they care), and their headmaster is so sick of their egotism that he leaves the comments section on their end-of-term reports blank for fear that anything even remotely complimentary will just inflate their egos further; they respond by steaming open the envelopes before their parents can get to them and forging gushing comments themselves.
</li><li> In <em>Bagthorpes Unlimited</em>, we see that even William, Tess, and Rosie have standards when it comes to insufferable geniuses when we meet their cousins, Luke and Esther. Luke has a wealth of trivial knowledge that has earned him a <em>Young Brain of Britain</em> championship, while Esther is a published poet, and this combined with the fact that they're both dull as dishwater socially leaves their cousins absolutely detesting them.

</li><li> Michael Grant's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GONE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GONE">GONE</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Astrid Ellison is the absolute Queen of this trope. Many characters (most notably Howard, Quinn and on occasion even her boyfriend Sam), have called her out on being too expressive with her knowledge. Many of the Perdido Beach kids end up resenting her for it, and even the fandom has an Astrid hate club on Facebook. (On the other hand, she has many militant fans too).

He made improvements to his textbook and invented his own spells while at school, is one of the few wizards capable of brewing the Wolfsbane Potion, and is the only wizard other than Voldemort capable of flight. Also, in the words of his actor in the films, he is a very interesting character.
</li><li> Hermione Granger. She's a bright, high-achieving witch who constantly tells her friends off for not studying as hard as she does. She also used to be an annoying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a>.
</li><li> Voldemort is evil, but also brilliant. At the end of the fourth book, he delivers a speech to his minions for a whole chapter. It basically consists of, "Let me tell you in excruciating detail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">how awesome and brilliant I am</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">how you are all morons</a>."
</li><li> Albus Dumbledore was like this as well when he was young. After his arrogance led to certain tragic consequences, he learned to keep his ego in check, pointing out that people who don't often wind up turning into self-destructive fools. That said, he still has his moments in the series proper.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dumbledore</strong>: In fact, being, forgive me, rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.
</div></li><li> James Potter and to a lesser extent, Sirius Black as teenagers. Teachers recall that they were the best at practically anything they tried, in classes and out, and they became Animagi at the age of fifteen (even helping their not as talented friend in doing so). However, this arrogance got on some people's nerves (or at least Snape, who was another Insufferable Genius and Lily, mainly because of Snape and James' fighting). He grows out of it.
</li><li> Draco Malfoy is also implied to be highly intelligent, albeit not quite as smart as he makes himself out to be. He's certainly a sovereign of insufferables.
</li><li> Percy Weasley is incredibly pompous and thinks very highly of his own achievements, but he <em>is</em> a very successful student, prefect, and Head Boy, and what's shown of his duelling gives the impression he didn't neglect practical studies either.

Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> thought Poirot was an insufferable know-it-all and grew tired of writing him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em>: Dick "Dickhead" Berenski. He has an egg-shaped head, he is considered creepy by a number of characters, he whines a lot about how every cop expects him to put his or her case at the top of the list, and he often has to be bribed with alcohol, sports tickets, and what have you to get him to put said case to the top of the list. He is also the chief lab tech, and he is a genius in his work.
</li><li> Kirsty from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy">Johnny Maxwell Trilogy</a></em> is a recognized genius and tends to win absolutely everything. However her constantly explaining to everyone just how stupid they are tends to drive most people away from her, which she assumes is a character flaw in everybody else.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> later reused this basic interpretation of the trope when he created Susan Sto Helit for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series. It's most heavily present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic">Soul Music</a></em> when she is still a teenager, and somewhat justifiable as a combination of considerable intelligence, an upbringing in cold, hard, rationalism and an innate awareness of the <em>true nature</em> of things due to her supernatural heritage. It still makes her be regarded as rather annoying or obnoxious by most who meet her — the primary exception are children, who take well to her view of them as basically being small adults and thus treating them as such.
</li><li> The witch Granny Weatherwax is an unusual combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>. Her spelling (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">heh</a>) and grammar are on a First Grade level at best, and she considers plenty of things most people take for granted to be stupid or unworthy of her time.

</li><li> The Wizard Saruman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings">Lord of the Rings</a></em> is like this. But Denethor is an even better example. Both are even insufferable toward Gandalf, which in Saruman's case is somewhat justified (as he is the head of the Istari, thus outranking Gandalf, and also widely acknowledged to be the smartest of them too—it's just that Gandalf is Saruman's superior in wisdom, integrity, and basic social skills), but in Denethor's case is remarkably cheeky.

</li></ul></li><li> Gareth Blackstock, star of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chef">Chef!</a>!</em>, was a classic example of this, although he would occasionally bestow compliments as well. "Everton, let me explain things to you. In the world of cooking, I am Einstein. Lucinda is Isaac Newton. And you are a mud-dwelling unicellular bit of jelly with a predilection for consuming its own excrement."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CombatHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CombatHospital">Combat Hospital</a></em> has Rebecca starting out as one of these, but slowly getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> over the course of the first season to mature out of it.

<ul><li> Both Reid and the entire cast are pretty much aversions of this trope. While all extremely smart and knowledgeable, they never act with arrogance or hostility to the local forces they are working with and never denigrate or insult others. In the second episode, Gideon refuses to brag about a genius call he made and preferred to have people work it out for themselves. Rossi is about as close as we get and that is more about him not being used to teamwork.
</li><li> When characters who act like this trope do appear, they are usually the killer. Examples include the sniper who believed himself to be much smarter and sabotaged by his co-workers and the killer who tried to get revenge on Rossi by trying to trick the team into a trap.
</li><li> Dr. Spencer Reid has an IQ of 187, can read over 20,000 words per minute, has an eidetic memory, three PhD's, BA's in Psychology and Sociology, can solve the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher">Bacon Cipher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> longhand, and almost played through every single possible move in chess. The only reason his coworkers haven't shot him yet is that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">uses his powers for good</a>, is a source of endless amusement due to his ignorance of pop culture, and the team's protective of him as their Little Brother-type.
<ul><li> Reid only really seems to slip into the Insufferable Genius mould when he's trying to annoy his teammates on purpose — again, very much like a little brother would. He's not really arrogant, though. In fact, in the pilot, someone asks him if he is a genius and he's kind of reluctant to say yes. He's just a bit over-eager to share information with people at the most inappropriate of times.
</li></ul></li><li> Prentiss does threaten to kill him once over his genius. He solved a 3D puzzle she had been working on for days (and declared impossible) in about three seconds.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> David Hodges on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> has shades of this. He is rather smart and loves to say it, and sometimes he does manage to do something that gets noticed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>'s Topher, who is tolerated by dint of being the only one around who knows how all the big shiny brain-scrambling devices work.
<ul><li> Also Bennett, although in her case it's less because of arrogance and more because of craziness.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Doctor is fond of explaining how brilliant he is to his companions, but as this is usually at the point where he has just solved whatever problem they're in, he tends to get away with it. Plus, he's saved the universe several times over as well.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rose:</strong> <em>[to Sarah Jane]</em> With you, did he do that thing where he'd explain something at, like, ninety miles per hour, and you'd go "What?" and he'd look at you like you'd just dribbled on your shirt?
</div><ul><li> Eleven does this more humorously than some of the others:
<div class="indent"><strong>The Doctor:</strong> Doctor Song, you've got that face on again. <br/><strong>River:</strong> What face? <br/><strong>The Doctor:</strong> The "He's hot when he's clever" face. <br/><strong>River:</strong> This is my normal face. <br/><strong>The Doctor:</strong> Yes it is. <br/><strong>River:</strong> Oh, shut up. <br/><strong>The Doctor:</strong> Not a chance.
</div></li><li> This trope is reason why Liz Shaw, the third Doctor's first companion who is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a> herself, decided to leave. As the Brigadier noted, she often remarked all the Doctor needed "is someone to pass you your test tubes, and to tell you how brilliant you are." In short, she had enough of his ego and walked. That said, after the Doctor was granted back complete control of his TARDIS, he soon mellows into the nicest and more gentlemanly of the incarnations.
</li><li> Twelve, like One, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>, and his first meeting with Danny Pink as an adult is absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">Cringe Comedy</a> worthy. While doing his science-y <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld">Save the World</a> thing, he nicknames Danny "P.E." and refuses to acknowledge that he's a maths teacher because, in his own words, "No, I can't retain that".
</li><li> This is one of the Doctor's qualities that backfire on him in the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight">"Midnight"</a>. The Tenth Doctor is characteristically flippant about assuming authority over the humans in his company, responding to the comment "Oh, like you're so special" with "As it happens, yes I am," and even after belatedly realizing that they aren't feeling it and trying to backtrack, he loses patience and snaps that he just knows what to do "because [he's] clever." This almost ends up being the death of him, as he becomes the focus of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">Witch Hunt</a> mentality.
</li></ul></li><li> Adric very much wanted to be one of these, but his sheer incompetence at pretty much anything outside of mathematics pretty much scuttled the character. As such, he frequently came across as being more "Insufferable" than "Genius", which went a long way towards cementing his status as the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a>.
</li><li> River Song. She appears to know as much as the Doctor due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being his "wife" in <em>his</em> future</span> and acts suitably insufferable a fair share of the time, but isn't one to sit about with her mouth open when things get hairy.
</li><li> Romana I came across as this, sometimes, but mellowed a little later on. Romana II, while a genius, was more good-natured about it. Combined, the Doctor and Romana (and K9) were formidably brilliant, though not that insufferable (mostly).
</li><li> Of course, loads of villains fall into this category, given the number of evil scientists and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">geniuses</a> the Doctor has faced, Luke Rattigan from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E4TheSontaranStratagem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E4TheSontaranStratagem">"The Sontaran Stratagem"</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky">"The Poison Sky"</a> being a shining example. The Doctor tends to have a lot of fun letting them ramble on about how intelligent they are, then simply shutting them up by easily proving how much smarter than them <em>he</em> is.
<div class="indent"><strong>The Doctor:</strong> Terraforming, biospheres, nanotech steel construction. This is brilliant. Do you know, with equipment like this, you could  ooh, I don't know  move to another planet or something. <br/><strong>Luke Rattigan:</strong> If only that was possible. <br/><strong>The Doctor:</strong> If only that <em>were</em> possible. Conditional clause.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Sherlock Holmes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em> starts out this way, insisting that his brilliance should exempt him from most social niceties. Over time he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">mellowed considerably</a> and started to treat those around him with more grace, largely due to Joan Watson's absolute refusal to tolerate his more insufferable behaviours.
</li><li> Sikozu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> is very intelligent, although her knowledge is mostly book smarts with little practical experience, but so annoyingly self-important that the rest of Moya's inhabitants can barely stand her.
</li><li> One thirteen year old caller to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>'s show (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElijahWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElijahWood">Elijah Wood</a>) calls about bullies picking on him for his smarts. After Frasier advises him that he'll get the last laugh later in life, the caller immediately turns into this, picking apart Frasier's advice and outright insulting him for it. Frasier then in turn takes a certain amount of vindictive glee in pointing out that the caller had now just announced to any of his bullies who might have been listening exactly where he is.
</li><li> Ross in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> tends to be right on many subjects and he always has to prove that he is right whenever someone says something grammatically incorrect or state a wrong fact. His friends naturally get annoyed by this. Of course, his genius wasn't the only insufferable thing about Ross...
</li><li> Yukawa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Galileo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Galileo">Galileo</a></em> is this to a T, being a genius physicist and more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a>. It annoys Kaoru and Misa to no end.
</li><li> Rico of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> skipped three grade levels, has an eidetic memory, can do complex equations in his head, and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who believes anyone less intelligent than he (read: everyone) is his to manipulate.
<ul><li> And yet, he <em>still</em> didn't figure out that Miley Stewart was Hannah Montana. He is floored that he was fooled once Miley went public, which leads him to a near mental breakdown until Jackson snaps him out of it.
<ul><li> There's also the fact that due to his aforementioned "Everyone is mine to manipulate" attitude he has <em>no</em> friends, many of whom are <em>suing him.</em>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> manifests his arrogance in different ways (he prefers putting others down to puff himself up), but he justifies his attitude by always being one intuitive jump ahead of the rest of the staff. It makes it very difficult to train his staff, because he'd rather cut them off at the knees than let them draw their own conclusions. (House's worst nightmare, according to "No Reason", is his subordinates solving the cases before he can.) His behavior is appropriate given the connections between House and Holmes (see Literature section above).
<ul><li> There was also an episode featuring a super-genius who couldn't deal with the pressure of the expectations everyone had in him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> so he intentionally drugged himself into a permanent dumbness haze to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">happy</a>. Which is what put him in hospital</span>. When the effect wears off, he more or less immediately becomes this. Notably, he rants that considering the IQ difference between him and his girlfriend, having sex with her might as well be bestiality.

</li><li> Souji Tendou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto">Kamen Rider Kabuto</a></em> carries himself with a confidence that almost suggests that he sees himself as more than mortal.

(Although it can easily be assumed that the only reason for that is that Decade was twenty-odd episodes shorter and Kabuto didn't have any world-hopping shenanigans to distract him.)
</li><li> Sento Kiryu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild">Kamen Rider Build</a></em> is Tendou 3.0 for those who thought that the original was <em>too</em> insufferable. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2g63y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2g63y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2g63y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> With the added value of his actor, Atsuhiro Inukai being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">Kabuto fan</a>. </span> He is a genius physicist with love for his inventions and intellect.

</li><li> Oddly (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">not-so-oddly</a>) enough, this trope was strongly inverted in the earlier seasons, where Malcolm viewed his intelligence as something that made him a freak, and was extremely self-conscious about alienating his friends and family if he demonstrated it.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, he doesn't have to worry about being upstaged since Carter, the one person possibly smarter than him, is at least two galaxies over, so his brains, and considerable courage under pressure, have been critical in saving the day so many times that his friends and the rest of the Atlantis team is willing to accommodate him. And, of course, he's always willing to brag about how he is the smartest guy in the world at the drop of a hat. In one scene, his password consisted of three birth dates: Newton's, Einstein's and <em>his</em>, upon which Sheppard mused, "Never underestimate that man's ego."
<div class="indent"><strong>Maj. Lorne</strong>: Wow. You really must be some kind of genius. <br/><strong>McKay</strong>: Well, as a matter of fact I— eh, wait. Why would you say that right now? <br/><strong>Maj. Lorne</strong>: <em>Something</em> has to have kept Col. Sheppard from shooting you all this time.
</div><ul><li> Then there's this jewel from "Brain Storm":
<div class="indent"><strong>McKay</strong>: Hey, I'm Dr. Rodney McKay, all right? Difficult takes a few seconds; impossible, a few minutes.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Even Daniel Jackson could be considered that, at least in his own field. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Colonel Martin Edwards in "Enemy Mine", after Daniel peacefully resolves the situation with a bunch of angry Unas.

For example, he's responsible for stranding the series' characters on the other side of the universe in the first place. (Ironically, now that they're there, he's the guy most able to help them with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> they found there.)
<ul><li> Interestingly, Rush <em>does</em> admit at one point that, in some respects, Eli is smarter than him, although he immediately asks that Col. Young keep this to himself.

She does back up her superior attitude by saving the crew's collective ass a little more frequently than she almost destroys them all, which is more than can be said for a surprising number of her crewmates.
<ul><li> <em>Voyager</em> also gave us the Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">not that one</a>), who was programmed to be the ideal doctor, and knew it. His constant preening didn't stop him from becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">a much-loved character</a>, though. In fact, it may even have helped.
</li><li> Like Seven of Nine, the Doctor had a great deal of knowledge but little social experience. It's hardly surprising they formed an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a>.
</li><li> And then there's one-shot character Mortimer Harren, who boasts about his theoretical knowledge and talks down to everyone—including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> herself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> gives us Dr Julian Bashir. In the early seasons, he's considered unbearably smug by many of his colleagues boasting about beating Vulcans in tennis matches, curing planetary plagues, and almost being valedictorian.

<ul><li> DS9 also gave us, in a one-off example, Professor Gideon Seyetik, whose very first appearance involved talking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">very loudly</a> about how awesome he was. Later, he turned out to be rather self-aware about his ego complex, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually sacrificed himself to preserve his wife's health.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Seyetik</strong>: A great terraformer has the green thumb of a gardener, the eye of a painter, and the soul of a poet.

</div></li></ul></li><li> There's also Q, who in addition to being godlike has an IQ in the quadruple digit range. At the start of the series, he's also beyond insufferable, planning on wiping out "less advanced" species and examining humans like they're simple toys. He gets less insufferable in later appearances, partly from time with Captain Picard and partly from his species (who are apparently not appreciative of his behavior) briefly stripping him of his powers. Still, he always retains this.
<div class="indent"><strong>Vash</strong>: It's over, Q, I want you out of my life. You're arrogant, you're overbearing and you think you know everything. <br/><strong>Q</strong>: [nonplussed] But I <em>do</em> know everything. <br/><strong>Vash</strong>: That makes it it even worse.

Even Gordon Freeman, who has up until that point, been practically showered with praise from every NPC that isn't trying to kill them.

Later on, he goes to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts">Julia Roberts</a> movie and gets thrown out because he's the only person in the theater who recognizes that the plot is an absolute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a> (everyone else thought Roberts was going to marry the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableFiance">rich jerk</a>). Eventually, he becomes so unhappy that he has Moe re-insert the crayon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">returning to his normal dumb self</a>.
<ul><li> Lisa herself often qualifies to this as well, in her worse moments. She longs to be challenged, but at times it's clear she enjoys feeling smarter than her peers.
</li><li> All the characters who make up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mensa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mensa">Mensa</a> group of Springfield were this. Oddly, with the exception of perhaps Comic Book Guy and Lindsey Naegle, this was a break away from their usual characterizations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sunstreaker. He's got mad skills, is very intelligent, routinely beats up Decepticons twice as strong as he is, and at the end of the fight will be more worried about his paint job than his comrades' status—some treatments of the character even hint that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a>.
</li><li> And then there's Sky Lynx, a skilled and powerful troop carrier/dino-bird/lynx/griffin who holds the rank of Lieutenant Commander. His massive size is dwarfed by his even more massive ego.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Sky Lynx:</strong> Before you do anything, think, 'Is this what Sky Lynx would do in my position?', and you will not go far wrong.
</div></li><li> And finally there's Highbrow, who's so egotistical he makes Sky Lynx look modest by comparison. Think of him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">Sheldon</a> as a robot helicopter and you're about right.

Dear, sweet Newton's apple, <em>Kowalski</em>. He is ridiculously intelligent, constantly builds things, working inventions that no human has thought of yet (A shrink ray, an invisibility ray), but the level of arrogance he displays borders on narcissism.
</li><li> Owl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAnimalsOfFarthingWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAnimalsOfFarthingWood">The Animals of Farthing Wood</a></em>, she constantly uses phrases or quotes famous philosophers but her 'wisdom' is nearly always unwanted or inappropriate for the situation, often resulting in the other animals telling her to simply shut up. Also, within the first season, she constantly believes that she would make the better leader rather than Fox or Badger despite both showing more competency in the position than she ever exhibited.
</li><li> Rick from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> is the smartest man on the planet and views everyone else as inferior because of it.

When he asks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stanley</span> to take one of his Journals and bury it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, he tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution">simply burn it instead</a>, but the author gets into a fight with him because the Journal contains his research and he can't bear to see it actually destroyed despite how dangerous it is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This trait nearly costs the good guys the final battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Bill Cipher</a>, as Ford condescendingly correcting a grammar error by Stan causes the latter to snap and attack him, interrupting the ritual they were attempting and distracting the group long enough for Bill to arrive</span>.

As a result of this, he considers himself to be above the rest of the cast.
</li><li> When Stumpy is given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenIntelligence">Sudden Intelligence</a> in one episode, he turns into a know-it-all and becomes so annoying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Mr. Cat</a> considers killing him.

Robot Jones?</a></em> will occasionally anger others by gloating about how his being a robot makes him smarter than them. The one most frequently cheesed off by this behavior is his maths teacher Mr. McMcMc.
</li><li> Gyro Gearloose has shades of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>.

He also seems to know quite a bit about how clocks work— although maybe not as much as he thinks since the first time he visits the clock tower it ends in disaster. He does fix the clock later, and also learns about the importance of both humility and having faith.
