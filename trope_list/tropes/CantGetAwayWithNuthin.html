</p><p>Okay folks, listen up: many of the dangerous behaviors in life are as insidious and widespread as they are because <em>most of the time, nothing bad comes of doing them</em>. If you don't wear your seat belt, most of the time, you'll be fine. It's just that on the rare occasion that fate calls you on it, the results are usually catastrophic.
</p><p>But if you do something wrong/dangerous/stupid on a TV show and divine justice <em>isn't</em> carried out, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> will decry the show for "promoting high-risk behavior".
</p><p>So on a lot of TV shows, <em>especially</em> those aimed at children, <em>every time</em> you do something bad, justifiable or not, you <em>will</em> get caught.
</p><p>There is a possibility that this trope is used simply because it's a good way to end a particular story, or an author's personal fantasy or something, and not as a deliberate way to get any message across. If fantasy was always like real life, then it would probably be completely boring. It's also a matter of basic story-telling economy: having a scene where a character does something with no consequences at all is just wasting a good scene.

In the Teen Drama, it's a recipe for tragedy. Drive drunk <em>even once</em> and somebody is going to die.

</p><p>This is sometimes called an "Institutional Lie" — the deliberate exaggeration of the dangers of a certain behavior because the audience wouldn't be persuaded by the <em>actual</em> dangers in the time allowed.
</p><p>The problem with this kind of lie is that it doesn't convince anyone. Rather than having the desired effect, the audience is liable to dismiss the morality play as obvious fiction, and their trust is lost.

<ul><li> Essentially the whole reason behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s existence. The one time he decided not to act and did something immoral instead, it came back to bite him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">in the worst way possible</a>.
<ul><li> The movie messes around with this; in the original comic, Peter ignores the criminal because he's letting his newfound fame go to his head and thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">it's not his problem</a>, so it does generally feel like he's being taught a karmic lesson in humility. In the movie, the crook robs the wrestling promoter who screwed Peter out of his prize money and Pete lets him go in order to spite the man, which lessens the impact somewhat because it's easy to sympathize with Peter's attitude in that scene. You could argue that it actually increases the impact, but changed the moral. Instead of being about humility, it was about responsibility (which the comic was also about. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">After all...</a>), which the movies are big on. Yes, the actions were understandable, but Spider-Man has to rise above that.

Since the clerk won't spot him two pennies from the (overflowing!) take-a-penny tray, Peter leaves, only to watch a street thug grab a handful of money from the register while the clerk's back was turned. Peter's reward for doing nothing, the milk the clerk refused him. Naturally, Peter doesn't help track down that thug for the clerk. Of course, that same thug then kills Uncle Ben, who had been chasing after Peter trying to find him. He dies because of two cents.

In those 10 minutes, a sonic virus was released that turned hundreds of children into walking skeletal corpses. This, as much as anything, contributed to his going insane.
<ul><li> For the double whammy, the virus was accidentally released by a scientist who had convinced the Plutonian to let him study a piece of alien tech instead of destroying it. The Plutonian took a chance that the guy could be trusted to do some good for the world with the potentially hazardous technology and it all just happened to go wrong at the very moment he took that break out of ear-shot.

However, Kimberly (said bow user) got grounded and they need her to help. One of the Rangers suggests just teleporting her there and get it over with.

Susie gets moved to the front of the class, and when she gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RosesAreRedVioletsAreBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RosesAreRedVioletsAreBlue">insulting note</a> from Calvin, she writes one in retaliation, only to get caught in the act and sent to the principal. Considering the reputation Calvin has, Wormwood's actions require some explanation. It's her job to treat all of her students fairly, even Calvin. She probably didn't hear Calvin talking. And besides, everything worked out when Susie actually gets a chance to explain everything to the principal. She got off the hook, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> hit Calvin like a ton of bricks.

The message to the readership is clear: don't gamble, drink, smoke, lie, cheat, sneak, steal, go out of bounds, consort with ruffians, refuse to do your lines, mercilessly provoke the mentally feeble, gang up on people in fights, or steal other people's cakes. Just don't. Go outside and play cricket instead.

<ul><li> As far as sex is concerned, yes. On the other hand, Marcus can't get out of that one time he stole a woman's phone (because it contained hard evidence that Homeland Security had imprisoned his friend illegally for most of a year) and ends up going to prison for it. The judge even mentions that it's a bit of an absurd edge case, but that <em>is</em> the law...
</li></ul></li><li> Paula Danziger employs this trope in a few of her books, particularly with heroines who decide to put themselves first for once after spending most of the book placating or looking after other people.
<ul><li> In <em>There's a Bat in Bunk Five</em>, Marcy spends most of her time as camp counselor trying to reach out to Ginger, a troubled and seriously obnoxious girl who makes life hell for both Marcy and the other youngsters in her cabin. Eventually, Marcy pretty much gives up on Ginger and starts enjoying her time at camp on her own terms, even starting up a romance... <em>then</em> Ginger decides she wants to talk when Marcy is occupied. Ginger throws a hissy fit and runs away — Marcy gets lectured on how she was focusing on her own fun and not looking after the girls.
</li><li> In <em>It's an Aardvark Eat Turtle World</em>, Rosie seems to spend most of her time being the diplomat and has had to make sacrifices to ensure her mother's relationship with her best friend's father is a success, such as giving up her pets because her kinda-stepfather is allergic. When she goes on holiday with her best friend/sister, Phoebe, she ends up feeling like a third wheel as Phoebe practically ignores her. Eventually, Rosie falls for Phoebe's cousin, Jason, and starts dating him, one of the few things she does for herself... whereupon Phoebe accuses her of being selfish and putting Jason first, resulting in Phoebe's ill-thought out decision to move back with her mother. Rosie spends much of the time afterwards feeling guilty about this turn of events.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAngelExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAngelExperiment">The Angel Experiment</a></em>, the Flock spend a night in New York sleeping in trees. They wake up the next morning with the police calling for them that what they're doing is illegal and to get down right now so they can have their parents called. Gazzy wonders who even looks up trees and Max comments "like there aren't worse problems going on than a bunch of kids sleeping in a tree".

One time, he was punished even though he was the victim of the crime rather than the one who committed it. The punishments ranged from being sent to jail, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">having to act as a guard dog for the night.</a>

Only the intervention of Melanie, Ashley's wife, saves her from total public humiliation — a punishment Scarlett herself says she would have gladly borne had they been caught any of the times that they <em>were</em> doing something wrong.

On her eighteenth birthday, she puts off reading the accounts from her Namorn estate, and her uncle upbraids her for neglecting them. Not unreasonable, except that she hasn't been to Namorn since age ten, that she's been completely occupied acting as her uncle's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> since his heart attack, <em>and</em> her Namornese cousin, who's sending these reports, is far too prideful to do anything like ask for help in plain terms. Her friends also criticize her anytime her status comes up — even getting on her case for "acting the countess" by using her position to <em>save a woman from a lifetime of marital abuse</em> by hiring her as a maid. (Of course, all four of them are pretty horrible to each other throughout.)
</li><li> A mild, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> instance in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> novel <em>The Commodore</em>. Hornblower, irritated by an odd thumping noise on deck, comes up to find out what it is and tries to think of some excuse for being there. Then he decides that dammit, he's a commodore now, he can ask any silly question he likes without having to feel self-conscious, so he calls Bush over to do just that—and realizes that the noise was from Bush's wooden leg. So he has to come up with an excuse <em>anyway</em>.
</li><li> The end of <em>A Dollar To Die For</em> has the Man with No Name arresting Tuco Ramirez for trying to get away with the gold they worked together to steal, and bringing him and Pinky Roebuck into the sheriff's office. However, he decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">throw Tuco a bone</a> by giving him a chance to escape from jail, because he considers the bandit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>.

This resulted in hanging lights being dislodged by said shot and landing on top of a bystander who stayed behind to film the altercation. Said bystander tries to sue the police, and Tim was kicked off the force.

<ul><li> Josh from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh">Drake &amp; Josh</a></em> fits this trope.

Come next season, he is back to being a grunt thanks to Jaime annulling his marriage, forcing him to work even messier and more dangerous jobs than when he was under Tyrion. It almost seems to make him regret not trying his chance against the Mountain. In the books, Jaime doesn't break his marriage and Bronn is more or less retired of the mercenary game, raising Lollys' bastard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>: In the 1962 episode "Lumpy's Car Trouble," Wally and Beaver might have gotten away with them causing damage to the family car (the exhaust was damaged when Lumpy took a "shortcut") and having it repaired behind their parents' backs ... except Ward learned from a co-worker that he had seen the boys push the car and (unwittingly) ratted them out. In addition to telling them, in essence, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">Big Brother Is Watching</a>, Ward asks the boys about what happened and the boys, knowing he's on to them, are forced to confess. This page's trope and the Big Brother Is Watching tropes combine to remind the boys they will always have to be on their best behavior because someone might be watching.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>, Elaine skips the boss's dinner party or whatever event and tells him she has to visit her father in the hospital. She is, in fact, going to the Yankees game with George and Kramer. When Kramer is hit by a foul ball, their picture is snapped and appears in the sports section the next day, which, of course, Elaine's boss never fails to read.
</li><li> Likewise, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>, when Jill doesn't feel like visiting with her Dad, she out-of-character makes up a white lie as an excuse for why she has to skip town and miss him. He dies. Naturally, her last words to him were another lie to get him off the phone.
<ul><li> When Jill buys a new sports car without Tim's help she forbids him to even touch it after he gives her a hard time for it. That doesn't stop him from hot-wiring it and taking it for a cruise. Of course, he gets stuck in traffic and a news crew covering the traffic jam gets a shot of The Toolman that prints on the front page of the Metro section the next day.
</li><li> Similarly, when Tim gets a little too friendly (doesn't go beyond 'flirtation', but he later admits that the subconscious desire was probably there) with a female mechanic he hires to work on Brad's Mustang, a Red Light Camera catches him with her in the passenger seat and his hand suspiciously across her chest. Bonus points for the ticket arriving on their anniversary.

Most of the people he encounters are just as shallow and self-centered as he is, but he always gets caught and called out on it.

<ul><li> Almost, once, in one episode, following a guest dying, and Basil constantly trying to stop the guests seeing the body, he's confronted by dozens of angry guests who all demand an explanation for everything, in one of his few Crowning Moments of Awesome, he quickly declares that his wife, who has barely bothered to help him throughout the episode will answer all their complaints, then quickly escapes by hiding in a laundry basket which was being carried off, thus escaping his usual comeuppance and leaving Sybil to deal with it.
</li></ul></li><li> The show <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OurHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OurHouse">Our House</a></em> loves this trope. It the kids do anything wrong, they <em>will</em> get caught, one way or another. There is one double subversion. On a dare, David takes Gus's car for a joy ride around the block. After returning to the driveway, he finds a small but noticeable dent. After going to extraordinary lengths to (successfully) get the car fixed, he seemingly pulls it off. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the very end, however, Gus comments on how the dent that had been there for a couple of years was now mysteriously gone.</span>
<ul><li> A near aversion takes place in another episode, where David leaves some dirty rags lying about in the basement. A few days later, the house catches fire, but quick thinking and the timely action of the fire department ensures that there is no serious damage and no injuries. Afterward, Gus tells the family that he doesn't want to know whose fault it was, as it might be simply too big for him to forgive.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> has a particularly spectacular track record for not letting anyone get away with anything. A recurring character had a son who resulted from the <em>one time</em> he had premarital sex. Possibly someone once got cancer from touching a cigarette.

Every "high-risk behavior" has immediate consequences. A girl gets pregnant from the one time she has unprotected sex (this one actually is true—you <em>can</em> get pregnant or infected from even one instance of unprotected sex, but the moral ought to be "use a condom", not "don't have sex ever"). The most popular girl in the school swallows one pill of ecstasy, and in the resulting high she manages to lose all her friends (plus, she has to go into rehab, you know, to cure her rampant addiction). But the kids almost always get away with petty crime, like stealing school property or cheating a restaurant.
</li><li> "Jagged Little Pill" (the Ecstasy episode) was relatively realistic. Did she royally screw up her life? Yes. Did she go to jail and/or suffer a permanently debilitating injury? No. Did the parents see the mess left over from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a>?

</li><li> Before that, "Trust Me" (Season 1) had an A plot where Joey and the guys take Snake's parents' car.

When nothing bad happens, Corey panics, thinking that God has forsaken him, since this is the first time he's ever gotten away with <em>anything</em>. When Mr. Feeny finally <em>does</em> reveal their plan, he's delighted by the karmic balance.

</li><li> Zack and Cody miss the bus and decide to skip school and go to the mall. Their mother just happens to decide to go shopping that day and Cody happens to win a contest to be in a music video filming that day. Their mother sticks around at the mall long enough to wander by the shoot and catch the twins.

Sonia caught the flu off Lorena so Lorena prayed to God and said she would give up watching her novellas for a whole month if it meant Sonia would get better. Sonia inexplicably recovered the next day though Lorena cracked after about a week and Sonia fell ill as soon as she switched the TV on. Then Larry and Lorena go to see a priest who says that they shouldn't make deals with God

The plot was done to incorporate the real-life pregnancy of the actress, and the writers explained that they thought it would be too much to have her pregnant by the guy who deflowered her.

In a later episode, his gun jams again, and we find out that he has been negligent in maintaining his weapons for a long time and has in fact been getting away with it for all that time.

Also an aversion, though, since the computer responsible for determining sentencing, which can read minds and see every crime you've ever committed, lets Lister go free "despite a number of petty criminal acts."

On the encouragement of her younger sister, she flips the poop onto his shoe.

She and her friends lie to their parents about going to a concert of their favorite band, the Wretched, in town and that they were going to stop at their friend Susan's house before heading over to the concert, when actually, they were going to the concert all the way in Baltimore. Cliff and Clair soon find out about this as they just so happened to be watching the news and they are talking about a fire at a paint factory that was spreading toxic fumes to a bunch of houses, and one of them happened to be Susan's house. The news-crew start interviewing people and one person they talk to happened to be Susan's grandmother, who says that nobody was in the house. Then when Clair mentions that Vanessa went to see the Wretched, Denise says that they can't be performing in New York because the last time they were there, they caused so much trouble that they were banned from performing in the state. Back on the news, Cliff and Clair see an interview with the lead singer of the Wretched, who was thanking the people of Baltimore for letting his band perform there. As soon as Vanessa gets home, after a few misadventures, Clair gives her one hell of a tongue lashing.

(The brother-in-law had gotten into a fight with the bouncer after he was caught dancing with his (the bouncer's) wife.) The judge sets bail and, with no money between them to come close to covering the cost, concede they have no choice but to tell their wives and admit they were out on a boys' night out. The tone of "What in the world are we gonna tell our wives" implies neither one of them were allowed to go out that evening, or else.

On the other hand, if you attack someone, it will immediately mean that the police will show up and try to kill you. Apparently, their apathy got patched.
<ul><li> To be fair, it's when you get CAUGHT attacking someone. If you stealth kill someone while invisible or snipe them from a dark alley or use untraceable disciplines to make them commit suicide, there won't be any trouble. Many other games can take this to a "Dude WTF?" level, with small crimes NO ONE EVEN NOTICES getting you in serious trouble. In Fable, you can be attacked by guards by accidentally taking one step inside the house of SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU a few seconds after shops close. Although since they just stop if you apologize, it's kinda subverted.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeRedemption">Vampire: The Masquerade  Redemption</a></em>, your party of vampires — including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque">The Grotesque</a> Nosferatu NPC — could walk around in full body armor with assault weapons and rocket launchers through New York and London(!) without any interference from the ever-present police. But the second you "kiss" someone's neck (i.e. drink blood), a battalion of SWAT officers descends on you like a rain of hammers.
</li></ul></li><li> Done to a huge extent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em>. The guards quickly find out if you've committed even the smallest crime (in this case, let's say you stole a turnip from a shop); soon, other city guards are alerted about this armed and dangerous turnip thief. Even if your fine is only five gold, the guards will stop at nothing to apprehend you.
<ul><li> More to the point, the guards have x-ray vision, as you can be in the middle of someone's house, in their basement, with no one around. Breaking in and walking around is no problem, but the second you pick something up, the guards will run into the house, run down the stairs, and tell you to "Stop thief!" unless you are crouching, which somehow makes you invisible. Oh, and a guard can see into your pack and identify stolen goods when you chat with them, and somehow stolen goods are distinguishable from regular goods. Yes, it appears that every time someone buys a carrot, they etch their name into it.

If that's not enough? The <em>Dark Brotherhood</em> gets a contract on you too! People can also put a bounty on your head even if they're <em>dead.</em>
</li><li> Early versions of the game had what may be the most extreme version of this trope yet encountered, thanks to a bug. You could slaughter an entire village and steal everything not nailed down. But bounty hunters still come after you for your crimes, because they received a bounty from an avenging <em>chicken.</em>
</li><li> Speaking of which, the same early versions also played this trope to an unbelievable extent, even more than in <em>Oblivion</em>. Eight out of ten crimes would get an instant bounty on your head, even when there is seemingly nobody around. And, in another example of a bug, it was later discovered that chickens, dogs, and even <em><a class="urllink" href="http://awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&amp;comic=012312">your own horse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> were being flagged by the game's engine as eligible witnesses!
</li></ul></li><li> Done to a rather comedic extent in Wario's story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a> Touched</em>, where after being warned to not eat any sweets, after some dental surgery, he does just that, immediately gets all teeth damaged, apparently has a seizure, flies about fifty feet into the air, smashes through the dentist's roof, and lands in the chair again.

In something of a subversion, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff and not be punished, so long as you do it in moderation. The police start taking action at one star, but a quick ride around the block fixes that. Hit two stars, and only heading to a Pay'N'Spray (or other options) will get rid of them. Otherwise, they'll just keep chasing you, and every time you respond with force they'll up the ante. By the time you cap out the wanted meter, you will be hounded by the military in their instant death collision tanks.
<ul><li> Played totally straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a> IV, where the police will go <em>batshit fucking insane</em> trying to catch you for a fender bender.

In that game, killing one person will result in the cops speeding to your position immediately. Even if you killed that person <em>with a silenced pistol in the middle of the desert</em>. In fact, the same happens if you're in the middle of a forest, no one around you, and you simply fire a single silenced pistol shot <em>into the ground</em>.
</li><li> Also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>: all of Trevor Phillips's carefully planned heists end up amounting to a big old load of nothing, even when they succeed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He manages to steal cargo from a heavily guarded freighter belonging to a private militia, only to relinquish the score because it was a bloody <em>nuke</em> and selling it would make him and his friends enemies of the state. He manages to hijack a plane carrying military hardware, only to have to ditch it when it gets shot down. He manages to wreck a train carrying valuable loot, only for his partner to steal one thing that he plans to give away to a man Trevor had wronged by attacking him and stealing his wife. Even in <em>GTA Online</em>, he pulls off a massive theft of drugs, only for the person he planned to sell them to reveal he's with the DEA.</span>

Forget to turn the iron off after using it, and you'll <em>immediately</em> burn down the hotel. Forget to click on your helmet every time you ride a bike, and you'll <em>immediately</em> wipe out and get a concussion. Better wear your life jacket when you get into that boat, or else you're <em>immediately</em> a spinning headline about a tragic drowning. And so on.

For example, if you kill everyone in Arefu, Lucy West in Megaton will still say something to the effect of "I heard about your little killing spree in Arefu. Get away from me!", even if there was no one around to witness it. Speaking of Megaton, decide to nuke it and <em>everyone</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including James</span>, will somehow know it was you.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, just having a "Shunned" reputation with either of the major factions is enough for them to send hit squads after you. In the case of the Legion, the squad will run up to you at a certain location and announce "The Caesar has marked you for death!", and sometimes they immediately spawn hostile without warning.

Later on, things turn the complete opposite direction when you unlock the 'Notoriety Wipe' options.

<ul><li> China refuses to air, broadcast, or show movies or TV shows at a cinema or on television if anyone who broke the law is not all captured or killed at the end of the movie. Some filmmakers have been forced to provide an "alternate ending" instead, where a character who was supposed to have gotten away or had a vague, suggesting ending was instead killed or captured at the very last minute, often with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> reasoning.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode">The Hays Code</a> fulfilled this function as Hollywood's moral watchdog, with such stringent moral standards, namely: that crime could never be portrayed in a positive light, and if someone did an immoral deed, they had to be punished onscreen; the law had to be respected and upheld; detailed crimes that could set a bad example were taboo. This force was dominant in Hollywood until Supreme Court rulings in 1948, which ruled that block booking was an anti-competitive and monopolistic practice, and in Freedman v. Maryland (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that ratings boards could only approve a film and had no power to ban a film, with the MPAA Ratings Code superseding the outdated rigid moral system.

Jim points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>'s terribly flawed copyright system, which allows people to make copyright claims on videos they don't have the right to claim (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> taking down a video of his for a small bit of footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>), actually removes any incentive not to break copyright laws.
