At that point, Takahata informs her that Negi's parents disappeared when he was a baby, and he was raised by his older sister. Reflecting how Negi had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedmateReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedmateReveal">crawled into her bed while she asleep</a> and explained to her that he's used to sharing a bed with his sister, Asuna is taken aback.
<div class="indent"><strong>Asuna</strong>: I guess I shouldn't have been so hard on him. The little brat's been through enough as it is.

<ul><li> When Kakashi has Sasuke tied to a tree pre-time skip and is talking about how nothing good ever comes of revenge, Sasuke accuses Kakashi of not understanding, and proposes killing everyone Kakashi holds dear, but then Kakashi says all his loved ones are already dead. Sasuke then stops talking long enough for Kakashi to tell him that they have lost much in the past, but gained new comrades, and that he should be using his Chidori to protect those comrades, rather than on his quest for revenge. Admittedly Sasuke's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">later character</a></em> outshines this little moment, still was a accidental Jerkass moment.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasuke</span> finally realizes what a dick he's been and decides to figure out the real reason he fights.
</li><li> Early on, Sakura confides in Sasuke that she believes that Naruto became such an undisciplined prankster because he had no parents to teach him how to behave, at which point Sasuke, who knows from personal experience that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">not having parents</a> sucks, promptly berates her and tells her that she has no idea what she's talking about, coldly telling her she's annoying and walking away. Having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">treated Naruto much the same earlier</a>, Sakura is taken aback and resolves to try and treat him better.
</li><li> At first, Neji used to lecture everyone about "destiny" and how they're idiots for thinking that they can change it. Later on, Naruto confronts him (even pointing out that he's being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a> because he's too trying to escape his own destiny). Afterwards, Neji admits he was wrong, and no longer bashes people. Later on, he also confronts the main branch for being responsible for making him believe this way.

It's this realization that marks Saya's change from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">takes a level in kindness</a>.

When Sucy suggests that she's been bottling up her feelings due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">being pushed around by Akko all the time</a>, Akko remarks why Lotte can't be forward with her feelings instead of acting gloomy and depressing all the time. Unfortunately, Lotte is standing right behind her when she says this, so she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">bluntly</a> states that she thinks Akko's ideas for the parade will fail and that she wants no part in it, leaving Akko to desperately try to take back her words. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Lotte changes her mind and returns for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment to deliver a hand-made replica of the hat worn by Shiny Chariot, Akko's inspiration for the parade and becoming a witch in general, Akko gives her a big, tearful hug and apology for being such an insensitive jerk</span>.

<ul><li> Ash:
<ul><li> In <em>Friends to the End</em>, after losing the Indigo League in an unflattering way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Ash was very upset</a> as he accused Misty of calling him lazy, which was technically true at the time. However, Ash realized that he was acting like a big baby when he sees and listens to how Ritchie dealt with his loses.
</li><li> In <em>Turning Over A New Bayleef</em>, Ash lashed out at his Bayleef to get away and stay from him, after she tried to approach him slowly, as he kept getting tackled by her. However, after a while, Ash realized his Pokémon absence and went looking for her. With the help of his friends, Ash realized that he didn't consider Bayleef feelings and felt bad for yelling at her. Despite his attempts to apologizes to Bayleef, Ash kept getting the silent treatment from her but he earned her forgiveness when she saw his attempts to save her from Team Rocket.
</li><li> In <em>Brave the Wave!</em>, after losing his Gym Battle against Brawly, Ash gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">frustrated</a> that he lost to a carefree Gym Leader as he thought he wasn't serious. Also, Ash even snapped at his friends when they tried to help him then he ran off with Pikachu not far behind him. However, while walking with Pikachu, Ash realized that he really lost it towards his friends and was wrong about Brawly as he can be a serious Gym Leader.
</li></ul></li><li> After evolving, Ash's Charizard becomes openly disrespectful to him, repeatedly refusing to obey him and either sleeping instead of battling or just becoming a raging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Berserker</a>. During the Orange Islands arc, this attitude leads to Charizard nearly getting the flame on its tail doused by a Poliwrath's Water Gun, and then nearly killed by an Ice Beam, leading Ash to spend the entire night unfreezing him and nursing him back to health; this causes Charizard to remember everything Ash did for it, beginning when Ash saved its life when its original trainer abused and abandoned it. With that, Charizard realizes how badly it has treated Ash, and by morning, it regains its loyalty and respect for him.
</li><li> In <em>The Path That Leads to Goodbye!</em>, Ash completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudEpisode">overacted</a> on Iris when he attempted to catch a Pokémon but felt bad later and even tried to make amends with her. However, after another argument and Iris left, Ash realized that he made a mistake and went looking for her to make things right with a little help from his friends. Also, in the same episode, Iris overacted on Ash as she accused him of giving her a bad fruit on purpose when he gave one to her as a peace offering. After leaving the boys, Iris thought about her fallout with Ash as she realized that he would never give anyone a bad fruit on purpose but it wasn't enough to go make things right with him. However, after seeing two of his Pokémon in trouble and truly realizing her mistake, Iris help Ash get their friends back then they both apologized for overreacting.
</li><li> In <em>Seeing the Forest for the Trees!</em>, after losing his Gym battle against Wulfric, Ash went to a state of depression for letting fear get the better off him as he went to the Winding Woods alone with his confidences shatter and questioning himself. However, Ash was visited by a very worried Serena as she attempted to cheer him up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">but didn't truly see as to why he was depressed when she concluded that the loss was the caused</a>. Hearing Serena's conclusion, Ash lost it as he told her that she had no idea what his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">situation</a> was. However, after a frustrated and heartbroken Serena pointed out that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">wasn't himself and wanted the real him back</a>, Ash realized that he really hurt her. Also, in the same episode, Serena felt bad for losing her temper towards Ash as she believed to be responsible for making him leave further into the Winding Woods. After reuniting with one another, Serena attempted to apologizes first for losing it but Ash stopped her from saying anything as he assured her that he was the one who really lost it then apologized and thanked her for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">helping him get out of his depression</a>.

When Asuna confides to Kyouko that her own parents are proud of her achievements and that Asuna's time in SAO and ALO taught her the value of having people who can appreciate her deeds, Kyouko realizes she has been an ungrateful mother and breaks down in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse">Tears of Remorse</a>.

</li><li> From the same saga, Goku has so much confidence in his son's ability to beat Cell, he actually gives Cell a senzu bean, which restores him to full health after he'd been weakened by his fight with Goku.

At the start of the story, the two are brought together for the first time in months by Master Fu, learning that they're Ladybug and Chat Noir, and are forced to confront what happened.
<ul><li> Marinette starts by saying that she doesn't blame him for his reaction, admitting that the way she'd acted didn't really set her apart from any of his other obsessed fangirls. "I wanted to believe I was different, because my feelings hadnt stemmed from your looks or your position in life or anything like that. They were feelings that were entirely anchored in the right reasons, so I let myself believe that because I liked you for your kindness and your talents and your selflessness that I wasnt just putting you on a pedestal of unreachable proportions just like everyone else had. But I was lying to myself. I had put you on a pedestal. I idolised everything that made Adrien Agreste who he was, but felt as though I could never be good enough for you, or even be myself around you, so I got to know you through ways that didnt involve actually forming a friendship with you, under the illusion that it was okay because I did know you, and we were sort of friends and everything. I found so many reasons to admire you, but without even realising it I used all those reasons to further push you to an unreachable point. It was bad for myself, and it was bad for you. So, I guess what Im trying to say is, Im sorry. Not for having the feelings I did, but the fact that I let them stop me from treating you like a normal person."
</li><li> In turn, Adrien tells her that nothing she did justified him being (as he now sees it) a jerk and a hypocrite about it, bringing up his own feelings for Ladybug. "Were partners and best friends, but the fact that I didnt know Ladybugs civilian side and totally idolised her on this unreachable level kind of meant I was no better than everyone who does the same with me, even if I liked her for the right reasons, just like you. When you told me how you felt, I already knew, but to hear it directly from you and to immediately feel kind of annoyed - once again, sorry - well, I looked back on it not much later and realised how hypocritical it was in retrospect. But all the times I wanted to apologise and try and patch things up Alya would pull you away because she was angry on your behalf, and no longer being in the same class meant we didnt see much of each other anyway. And I never really knew what Id have said, anyway. 'Hey Marinette, sorry I was a jerk when you said you liked me but the thing is, I have a massive crush on Ladybug who doesnt like superhero me and doesnt know civilian me and I put her on a pedestal the same way you did so really Im in no position to judge you but Im just sick of people idolising me is that okay?' never really had the best ring to it."

After hearing all this from Holt, Jake apologizes to him for being an insensitive jerk and makes an effort to behave (somewhat) better in future episodes.

She gets hit with this when her refusal to cooperate with the other Scoobies leads to Giles and Willow being kidnapped and nearly ritually sacrificed.
</li><li> In the season 3 episode "Revelations", Xander, furious that Angel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> and Buffy withheld it from the rest of the Scoobies, gives Faith the bare minimum of details regarding it, knowing she won't hesitate to stake Angel.

Xander believes he's trying to take advantage of Buffy's mother's death to score points with Buffy, but Spike adamantly insists that he was actually trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">pay his respects to Joyce</a>, as she was the only one of Buffy's "lot" that was ever nice to him. Xander refuses to believe Spike, who eventually gives in, throws the flowers down, and storms off, telling Xander to think whatever he wants. As soon as he's gone, Willow picks up the bouquet and informs Xander that Spike didn't include a card with the flowers, surprising them both with the knowledge that Spike really <em>was</em> trying to pay his respects.
</li><li> In the above episode, Dawn openly accuses Buffy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst">not caring or even grieving over their mother's death</a>, because she's been running around and treating it like "just another chore." At that, Buffy breaks down and confesses that, far from being emotionless about Joyce's death, Buffy has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode">bottling up her emotions because it's the only way she can deal with the grief</a>.

Then Ted joins in the taunting of JD, Ted asks why are they clapping and Dr. Cox says, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His dad died</span>..." Ted then immediately stops clapping. "Damnit..."
</li><li> Also is Season 8 when Elliot is shown how depressed Keith is over her treatment of him.
</li><li> A rather odd one in where JD has just revealed to the entire waiting room that he received a DUI last night. Cue flashback to a few minutes ago with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman">Nurse Roberts</a> saying that a girl involved in an drunk driving accident had made it, but her mother had died. However, the jerkassery lies in the way that he brought it up so flippantly, not in the DUI itself since, as we see earlier in the episode, he actually got it for walking (not driving) his moped home while drunk, with the moped on only to play the radio, making it seem like he was about to get on while intoxicated.
</li><li> Dr. Cox spends most of an episode doing community service, and is being driven up the wall by Denise Lemmon, an annoyingly optimistic paramedic, who simply will not shut up about her son, her son's favorite baseball card, or how he'll always be ten years old to her. Eventually, after Denise crashes the ambulance, Cox loses it and goes off on a rant towards her. Minutes later another paramedic hands Cox the baseball card, that was recovered from the ambulance, and Cox finally puts the pieces together, realizing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Denise's son had been killed in an accident</span>.
</li><li> In another episode, Dr. Cox, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist">Hollywood Atheist</a>, becomes determined to convince Nurse Roberts, a devout Christian, that everything is a coincidence.

Cox softly offers an apology and stops pushing the issue.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>, the eponymous hero never holds back from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">telling the truth as he sees it</a>, generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">not caring</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">even realizing</a>) if he offends or upsets people in the process. But every now and then he has a moment of clarity where he belatedly realizes just how insensitive hes being.
<ul><li> One notable example is when he draws attention to one of Mollys hand-wrapped Christmas presents, stating that shes obviously arranged it specifically for someone she has romantic feelings for, and spends a good few minutes rather brutally lampooning her for it, before picking up the parcel and realizing that its <em>his</em> name written on the card (by which time Molly is close to tears and everyone else in the room is massively uncomfortable). For once, he not only realizes what a jerk he has been, he actually <em>apologizes</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">to the shock of everyone watching</a>.
</li><li> Another example takes place when Mycroft visits the flat and at one point ends up very rudely telling Mrs. Hudson to stay out of the conversation, leading Sherlock to bring him to heel. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Sherlock</a> has to tell you to stop acting like a jerk, you know you've screwed up royally. Mycroft immediately apologizes. Though Sherlock <em>also</em> immediately tells Mrs. Hudson to butt out of things, thus puncturing the moment a bit, he is at very least slightly more polite about it.
</li><li> In the first episode, upon being told that the "Rachel" message the victim carved on the floor is the name of her miscarried daughter, Sherlock launches into a rant about how this makes no sense because she shouldn't still care about something that happened so long ago. The look of sheer dismay on John's face at this blatant lack of compassion stops him cold, and after a moment he hesitantly admits that what he said was "not good".

Then they find out they've just asked the man to kill his 10-year old son. Yep, Sam and Teal'c are Jerkassess.
<ul><li> Though Teal'c justifiably points out that Daniel wasn't given the chance to volunteer to keep said child alive.

Despite his attempts to be friends with Bailey, Cody could't let go of his anger and hurt as this led him to write a play about their breakup. However, after the play and a talk with Zack, Cody not only realized how bad of a jerk he was too Bailey but also that he made a mistake of breaking up with her.

When he later realizes he forgot to send it and breaks down in tears, Brain finally snaps and snatches away his "stupid letter", ordering him to see to his device. Just seconds from his plan succeeding, Brain reads the letter out of curiosity, discovering it is actually a heartwrenching speech from Pinky about his "best friend in the whole world, the Brain" and how he never gets the respect he deserves, pleading for Santa to give every present intended for Pinky to him (and the world should he have it in that big old bag of his). The letter (and the sight of a heartbroken Pinky still loyally tending to his work) leaves Brain a teary eyed wreck, only able to muster out a Merry Christmas through his control booth before smashing it to pieces.

<ul><li> In the April Fools Day episode, SpongeBob keeps pulling silly and (to Squidward) annoying pranks on everyone (such as one of which only putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">one ice cube in a drink where the patron asked for a couple of them</a>). Eventually, Squidward gets so fed up that he decides to get revenge on SpongeBob by showing him what a "real" prank is. He then sets up an elaborate, physically painful, and rather cruel prank on SpongeBob that causes the latter to leave the Krusty Krab in tears. After all the customers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">call Squidward out on this and storm out in disgust</a>, Squidward looks around and sees the damage his "harmless" prank did to the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob and realizes he went too far.
<div class="indent"><strong>Squidward:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> Why is it whenever <em>I'm</em> having fun, it's <em>wrong</em>?
</div></li><li> In the Christmas special, Squidward cruelly mocks Spongebob after Santa fails to come like Spongebob thought he would. Not long afterwards, he realizes how much of an asshole he was, complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualGag">Visual Gag</a> of a photo of a donkey (To show how he was being a jackass). He spends the rest of the episode trying to make it up to him by acting as Santa.
</li><li> In the episode "What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?", <em>all</em> of SpongeBob's friends get exasperated with SpongeBob's clumsy behavior, call him "idiot boy," and bluntly tell him to get lost. They're left in tearful remorse when they discover that SpongeBob has run away as a result and do everything they can to find him and bring him home... except for Squidward, who's ecstatic that SpongeBob is gone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "On The Run", Amethyst takes Steven to the Prime Kindergarten, the place where Amethyst was born. When Pearl finds out, she's <em>furious</em> that Amethyst told Steven about the Kindergartens, because as it turns out, the Kindergartens were part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">resource extraction project</a> that, had it continued, would've destroyed Earth and killed all life on it; an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a> that the Crystal Gems didn't want Steven to know about. The resulting argument results in Amethyst lashing out violently and attacking Pearl. The fight gets interrupted and Amethyst runs off, and Pearl is surprised and confused that criticizing the aforementioned project upset Amethyst so badly. It turns out Amethyst hates herself for having been created by such a horrible and evil project, and Pearl's condemnations of the Kindergartens felt like a condemnation of Amethyst herself. Pearl tries to explain that she wasn't saying that Amethyst's birth wasn't a bad thing just because the Kindergartens were bad, but when she puts her explanation into words Pearl realizes that that was <em>exactly</em> what she was saying. This realization prompts Pearl to give a heartfelt apology and ask for Amethyst's forgiveness.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pearl:</strong> No, no, Amethyst <em>you're</em> not the mistake, you're just the byproduct of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap">...big mistake.</a>
</div></li><li> In "Keystone Motel", Garnet ends up accompanying Steven and Greg to they nearby state of Keystone on an errand as an excuse to leave the house after her huge fight with Pearl in the prior episode. However, not long before they arrive at the motel, she ends up splitting into Ruby and Sapphire, who are arguing over whether or not they should forgive Pearl. Throughout the trip, the two's arguing and hostility stresses Steven more and more until they descend into shouting in the diner the next day, causing Steven to crack and leave the restaurant after dropping his plate. Ruby and Sapphire immediately stop fighting and follow him outside, where Steve just vents out how horrible everything has been because of all the tension before even musing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex">if it's his own fault</a>. The two are immediately stricken with remorse and the shock is enough to force them to talk things through and confess their own feelings on the matter before fusing. It hits Sapphire especially hard because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">future vision</a> lets her know their feud will eventually end, and thus she thinks she's being the bigger Gem by accepting this outcome while Ruby continues to throw a tantrum. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse">driven to tears</a> when she realizes how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">insensitive</a> she's being to Ruby because of this. Similarly, the shock is enough to get Ruby that in her frustrations, she's been making the problem worse and hurting everyone else, while also forgetting that while Sapphire may be acting calm about the thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouThinkICantFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouThinkICantFeel">she's also upset about what Pearl did.</a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Sapphire:</strong> I keep looking into the future, when all of this has already been solved... As if it doesn't matter how you feel in the present... <em>[starts to cry]</em> No wonder you think I don't care! <br/><strong>Ruby:</strong> Sapphire... Nonononono, this is all <em>my</em> fault! I didn't want to look for a solution, I just wanted to be mad — you're <em>right</em>, you're <em>always</em> right, I was being stupid! <br/><strong>Sapphire:</strong> <em>I don't think you're stupid!</em>
</div></li><li> In "Dewey Wins", Steven, having unexpectedly returned from Homeworld after previously giving himself up to save Connie, Onion, Jamie, Lars, and Sadie from being taken to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleZoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleZoo">People Zoo</a>, doesn't understand why Connie is unhappy with him for doing so. While he had a good reason (Mainly the fact that one of the Gems who came for them could stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Alexandrite</a>), she feels that he forgot about their training together for these kind of situations. The following day, he tries to help Mayor Dewey keep his position as Mayor when Nanefua decided she would like to be elected. After she brings up better points than his own, he resigns, and Steven catches himself responding in a similar way to Connie, now realizing how he made her feel.
</li><li> In "The New Lars", when Steven spends the whole day in his body. Lars was depressed and shocked to find out what Steven and everybody (including his own parents) liked the "new" him and didn't noticed or missed him at all. That when he decided to still act like himself but more nicer and open about his feelings.

<ul><li> In "New Girl in Town," Raph repeatedly criticizes Leo's leadership skills and methods, eventually leading to an exasperated Leo giving him the leader position to see if he can do it any better. It doesn't take long for Raph to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">crack under the pressure</a>, leading to Mikey getting injured by Snakeweed; when they get back to the lair, Raph gets hit with this, acknowledging that he's not fit to be the leader and now realizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">how tough Leo has it</a>.
</li><li> In the season two premiere, April's father accidentally got mutated into a mutant bat. When she learns the turtle were responsible for the accident, April loses it and declares that she doesn't want to see them again. Several episodes later, April was approached by Donnie as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology">tried to apologize to her for what happened to her father, but her blind hatred has lead her to not listen to him, who feels horrible about the whole thing</a>, although she took a moment to listen to his advice about some things can't be controlled. However, after Casey tells her his backstory of how he accidentally destroyed a friendship, and remarked that some things can't be controlled, the same thing Donnie said to her, April realizes how wrong she was to be so hard on the Turtles, especially Donnie. While being attacked by Karai, April takes Donnie and Casey advice as it convinced her to call the Turtles for help. After being saved, April forgives the Turtles and in return apologizes to them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardOnHim">her poor treatment towards them</a>.
</li><li> In "A Foot Too Big," Donnie finds himself the recipient of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti">Bigfoot's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">unwanted advances</a>, and complains about how she keeps bugging him and following him everywhere, to which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Raph</a> remarks that that's exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">what Donnie himself does to April</a>. Donnie gets hit with this, and by the end of the episode vows to dial it back.
</li><li> In "The Croaking", after scolding Mikey for a mess he made and sees that he ran away, the boys complain about cleaning up after him but April told them about how completely inconsiderate they were too him. Also, April tells the boys that they don't truly appreciate Mikey for who he is or what he does for them, especially Raph. Realizing that April was right, the boys felt remorses as they agreed to be more respectful towards Mikey.

However, Jimmy was unintentionally shown footage from Goddard that showed him how overboard he went as hall monitor. Seeing the footage, Jimmy realized how badly he got carried away and purposely broke the rules to get fired from being hall monitor.
