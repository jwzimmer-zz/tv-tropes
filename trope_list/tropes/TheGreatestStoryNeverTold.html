<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> After Luffy defeats Buggy and the rest of the Buggy Pirates in Orange Town, the rest of the townspeople (who were hiding in the outskirts) show up. When they see their Mayor Boodle has been knocked out, they quickly accuse Luffy and co. of hurting their leader and being pirates- which Luffy happily admits. (He knocked out Boodle to keep him from getting in the way of he and Zoro's pawning of Buggy's crew.) And so the future Straw Hat crew is chased out by the very people they saved, who had no idea about what happened. A mini-arc after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> implies that Boodle cleared up the confusion.
</li><li> In the aftermath of the Captain Kuro arc, Usopp swears the "Usopp Pirates" and Kaya to secrecy about them defeating the Black Cat Pirates, despite the fact that it would clear his reputation as a liar. He does this so that the villagers would not worry about pirate attacks.
</li><li> The Alabasta Arc, as well, features the world at large never knowing the full events about the Civil War and Crocodile's defeat.
</li><li> This continues to happen as the story progresses - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">the World Government</a> usually goes to great lengths to cover up their failures and mistakes to make sure its enemies do not gain support.
</li><li> Subverted near the end of Thriller Bark. The Government decides that they can't let the people know that Luffy toppled <em>another</em> member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and order Bartholomew Kuma to kill everyone on Thriller Bark. Luckily, Kuma decides, for his own reasons, to simply make a show of force and leave the heroes alive.
</li><li> Averted at the end of the Dressrosa Arc; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Admiral Fujitora</a>, aware that the Government would spin the official report on what happened to show themselves in a favorable light, publicly discloses the full truth on Luffy's victory over Doflamingo to the people before telling his superiors anything. Once found out Vice-Admiral Smoker (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor">who was falsely rewarded for the events of the above Alabasta Arc</a>) thanks him and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki (Akainu) is livid.
</li></ul></li><li> The Zero Requiem plan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> involves creating world peace with no one ever knowing the real details behind how it came to be. Well, a chosen few know, but the truth certainly isn't going to make it into the history books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> - Ash Ketchum is occasionally recognized by random people who saw him lose in regional tournaments. Nobody seems to know he saves the world a few times every year on the side. Ash <em>himself</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">can't remember the first time he did so</a>. Even more bizarre, no one even mentioned him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bringing down <em>two</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">legendaries</a> on live television</span>. And being the ONLY person in the whole of Sinnoh to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have managed to take down even one of said legendaries</span>, you'd think that'd earn him some street cred.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hundreds of years ago, Master Mutaito sacrificed his life to stop King Piccolo's original rampage. In the present, only his still-alive students Master Roshi and the Crane Hermit remember this.
</li><li> Almost all of Goku's adventures and world-saving isn't known by the general public. Only a few people know that he's the one who killed King Piccolo and beat his son three years later at the 23rd Martial Arts Tournament. No one knows who destroyed the Red Ribbon Army, who stopped the Saiyan Invasion, and the entire mess with Frieza happened on another planet and he was killed before he could terrorize the Earth. This gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> when Goku begs the people of Earth for energy to fuel the Spirit Bomb, and gets almost nothing since the public have no clue who he is.
</li><li> After Gohan destroys Cell, Mr. Satan steps in and takes all the credit instead. Not that the heroes mind — they like their privacy, although they're still annoyed by Mr. Satan being a shameless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a>. This would become a plot point in the next arc, as Mr. Satan, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a>, is responsible for most of the energy granted from the Earth's population into Goku's Spirit Bomb, destroying Buu. Even then, the Dragon grants a wish for everyone to forget what Buu looks like, but not devastation he caused, which is how the people still remember Mr. Satan as the savior.
</li></ul></li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> shows everyone slowly forgetting about Utena and everything she did. Well, almost everyone. While Akio muses on how, despite what she managed to do, she failed to achieve revolution because of this trope, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anthy proves him wrong by voluntarily walking out of the fairytale-like world of Ohtori Academy to find Utena, signifying the end of Akio's machinations</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The entire series ends up being a GSNT due to Madoka's wish</span>—only Homura remembers what happened, and even Kyubey only acknowledges that she <em>might</em> be telling the truth.
</li><li> Homura's back story goes unknown for most of the series. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has been trying to protect Madoka in over 100 timelines and keeps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">repeating the same month</a> trying to find a way to save her.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> has this as the entire premise: everyone thinks Celestial Being is just a terrorist group that just happens to be capable of curbstomping everyone into the ground all by themselves. It does change a little at the end of the second season when they get some recognition for exposing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">A-LAWS</a> but they're still regarded as terrorists. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> may have seen them eventually recognized as heroes if humanity's first two interstellar spaceships (the <em>Sumeragi</em> and the <em>Tieria</em>) being named after members of Celestial Being is any indication. Not to mention the <em>start</em> of the movie, where there's Celestial Being: The Movie, where they're heroes fighting to defeat A-Laws in an inaccurate retelling of the second season.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> prequel manga <em>Fight 7th</em>, Shuji Kurosu and his friends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AKA the future Master Asia and Shuffle Alliance</span> go to the South Pole to keep a crazed terrorist from destroying the space colonies. They succeed, but fail to make it to Gundam Fight's Finals in time and are eliminated. Not only is their story is untold, but their home nations also consider them cowards and traitors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em> is all about this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> builds a Gundam specifically designed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">deliver a nuclear warhead</a>, which gets stolen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">Zeon remnants</a>, all as part of a plan to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> to weaken the Federation's authority. All evidence of the incident is hushed up afterwards and the data of the GP-series Gundams is completely erased, though some elements of them show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta</a></em>-era machines<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06669');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06669" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06669');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>, since <em>0083</em> was made six years after <em>Zeta</em></span>.
</li><li> The manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GundamExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GundamExpandedUniverse">Gundam Legacy</a></em> has a similar tack, especially in the final volume (ironically set one year after <em>0083</em>). Another group of Zeon holdovers has plans to nuke their home colony as punishment for "knuckling under" to the Federation, and an alliance of Federation, Zeon, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Titans</a> characters forms to prevent the crisis.

There are urban legends about the things he's done (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">defeating Accelerator</a>), but (being urban legends) few people take these seriously. Touma doesn't mind much, as fame doesn't interest him. Touma's adventures <em>are</em> well known in the world of magic, where he is regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>.
</li><li> Touma almost single-handedly defeats some terrorists who hijacked the plane he was on, then leaves to his destination when the plane lands. Despite several people, including the pilot and a flight attendant witnessing this, they don't mention him at all when they get interviewed by reporters.
</li><li> Later, Touma helps save the world and end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>, but goes missing for a while, with the people who know him thinking he is dead. When he returns, his friends are relieved, but everybody else yells at him for skipping so much school for "no reason".
</li><li> The conflict with Othinus is probably the greatest example of this in the series. Touma <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fights a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> singlehandedly for an unspecified but extremely long time, eventually talking her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. This is completely unknown to everyone except the Will of the Misaka Network, Othinus, the other Magic Gods and Aleister Crowley. Touma then fights against the rest of the world to stop Othinus being killed. He never fully explains the reasons for this, since it's simply too unbelievable. In the end, he's congratulated by various world leaders on international television for managing to save Othinus. However, since his personal details weren't mentioned, most people still have no idea that it was Touma who did this.</span>
</li><li> In episode 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>, Touma saves everyone from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Graviton Bomber's</a> bomb, but since everybody else ducked and closed their eyes, only Mikoto saw it. Everybody assumed Mikoto was the one who blocked the explosion. Later, Mikoto asks Touma why he didn't step up and explain that he was the one who saved the day. Touma says that as long as no one got hurt, it doesn't matter who did it.
</li><li> Why stop with Touma? In Indexverse, the world won't reward you with fame for being a heroic person. Just ask that Shiage guy.
</li><li> Or that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Accelerator</span> guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">and his little friend.</a>
</li><li> Or that Misaka girl. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce">And Kuroko girl. And Uiharu, and Saten</a>. They solve the Level Upper case and defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Therestina</span>, and yet no one acknowledges their exploits. Heck, Academy City continues to treat Misaka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and her Sisters</span> like dirt.
</li></ul></li><li> The short film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kigeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kigeki">Kigeki</a></em> is about a young girl who seeks out the Black Swordsman to save her village from an approaching army, in return for a special book. The Swordsman agrees and decimates all 200 soldiers in one night, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then, being a vampire, he devours the corpses.</span> The girl sees it all, and before he goes the Swordsman tells her that if she ever breathes a word of it he'll return and kill her too. Many years later, she has continued to keep the secret.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, as in Ancient Egypt Atem could only defeat Zorc and Bakura by sealing his soul in the Puzzle, killing all three in the process and using his own name as a seal on the ancient power. This gives him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryGuidedAmnesia">Victory-Guided Amnesia</a>, and the villains aid his quest to regain his memories as they want to get his name and take his power to resummon the evil god. However, part of the seal was that Atem erased himself from history, so in the original Japanese no-one knows that he saved the world. The tournaments he wins while in Yugi's body also get credited wholly to Yugi since no-one but Yugi's friends know of his existence.

But at the same time, the viewer/reader somehow knows that most people would never get to hear his side of the story.

</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> was originally intended to only run for one season, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Usagi's final wish for a normal life reviving her, Mamoru and the other girls but with no memories of meeting each other or of anything else that happened. Had the show ended there, this means that they fought and died to save the world, but nobody will ever know including themselves (though Artemis has hope that they will all meet again).</span>
</li><li> In a sense, it could be said about the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fifteen kids fight and die to save the world, but nobody except for Machi's brother (who's going to die at the end of his battle), their closest relatives and a few selected government people know about it.

That said, Saitama still moves up in rank after each victory, because the Hero Association at least recognizes that he is responsible (and if he's not, they figure promoting him will prove it). He's also slowly gaining the respect of various heroes, who do realize that Saitama really is as powerful as advertised.

<ul><li> Miles "Tails" Prower's early appearances. He had several comics where he would return to the Nameless Zone or join the Zonerunners in Chemical Plant Zone where he would perform great feats (usually by fluke), save the day, but on return not be able to say anything to Sonic either because it's hard for him to explain what happened or because Sonic is just too damn eager to move onto the next thing. A Summer Special issue continued this tradition by having a comic where Tails took out a whole swarm of badniks, only to have the last one catch him off guard and have Sonic to save him from it. Sonic admonishes Tails for not being able to defeat "one measly badnik" and doesn't believe Tails' protests that there were many more of them.

Most of the time no-one seems to notice his involuntary self-sacrifices, though the trope might feel a bit ignored, as Scrooge often observes the hapless heroics while commenting calmly on the situation. The answer might be that Donald has saved them so many times the bravado has lost all effect. Finally, <em>finally</em> subverted in Rosa's final Donald story, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://disneycomics.free.fr/Ducks/Rosa/show.php?s=date&amp;loc=D2004-032">The Magnificent Seven (Minus Four) Caballeros<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, in which Pancho Pistolas and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Jose Carioca</a> are flabbergasted by Donald's off-hand comments about his adventures with his rich uncle, particularly when he backs it up by saving their bacon repeatedly.

</li><li> A six-issue limited series from Marvel Comics told the story of a normal human who was down on his luck and borderline suicidal who gets killed right as an extra-dimensional big bad is opening a rift with a magic artifact intending to unleash the embodiment of Death upon the multiverse. His resulting passage through the gate closes it and bonds him to the weapon making him immortal and causing him to be reborn into another universe anytime he dies as only the weapon can end his life. He eventually foolishly returns the weapon to the Big Bad after getting a promise to leave Earth alone and return him there but upon seeing all the deaths occurring sacrifices his life and dies a noble hero to end the Big Bad's scheme once and for all.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Tolkien's Legendarium</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> it is implied that the majority of the peoples populating Middle-earth have forgotten almost everything about the First and Second Ages, including the existence of The One Ring of Power. Even Gandalf is unsure about the details until he spends almost a year in research. This, of course, changes.
</li><li> Upon reading <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HistoryOfMiddleEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HistoryOfMiddleEarth">History of Middle-earth</a></em>, it eventually becomes clear that the victory over Sauron was partially contingent on the activities of two people who are never mentioned by name nor barely alluded to in the trilogy. (They kept most of Sauron's forces tied up deeper within his domain and well away from the events of the books, preventing him from simply crushing the allied armies and flooding Mordor with so many troops the hobbits likely wouldn't have successfully slipped by.)
</li><li> Also, despite the fact that Frodo essentially saved the world, among his fellow hobbits, he is much less famous than Sam, Merry, or Pippin. This is mostly due to the hobbits' remarkable focus on their own culture over all others, so that Merry and Pippin, as the defeaters of Saruman, and Sam, the Mayor, are respected and immortalized while Frodo is generally ignored.

The sergeant's last words? "For the glory of Rynn's World, shining gem of the Imperium, second only to Terra itself."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a> wrote a pair of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> novels called "Survivor's Quest" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight">Outbound Flight</a>"; "Survivor's Quest" has Luke and Mara looking at the ruin of Outbound Flight and finding survivors, "Outbound Flight" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">deals with Outbound Flight</a> and the circumstances that led to its crash. They're set several decades apart and were written in that order.
<ul><li> From <em>Survivor's Quest</em> we know that the survivor civilization <em>hates</em> the Jedi for having a hand in their situation, and Luke and Mara find a lightsaber and a distinct Chiss weapon. Chiss forces shot down Outbound Flight; thus, the two Jedi assume that this was the site where a Jedi fought invading Chiss and both died. Reading <em>Outbound Flight</em>, we find that this Jedi and that Chiss were working together to save those survivors, knowing that in doing so they were going to die. And no one ever knew. It's a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">heartbreaking</a>. Even Luke and Mara, Jedi themselves, never knew.

One of the best men in the world acted like a fiend for no reason." According to Fr. Brown, "First there is what everybody knows; and then there is what I know. Now, what everybody knows is short and plain enough. It is also entirely wrong." Fr. Brown, respecting the will of the participants of the events, chooses to keep his (public) silence about what really happened because in none of the memorials of the event does he see anyone wrongly condemned, only wrongly praised.

A need to be liked isn't really a part of his character, but he is still too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">proud</a> to make excuses for his actions. It's also implied that the guilt he feels over all the <em>other</em> things he stood by and watched Aerys do plays a part (ironically nobody besmirches his honor for standing by and watching innocent men be burned alive, strangled to death, etc). In the TV show, Jamie makes it clear that he just doesn't think anyone would believe him.

He is basically a highly decorated covert ops agent, while in his public persona he projects a spoiled noble who got a cushy job because of his father's influence. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Memory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Memory">Memory</a></em>, to make a point, he puts on his dress uniform and all the medals he's accrued over the course his career, the first time they've been displayed together in one place, and even he is surprised by how many there are.

Even Dumbledore is pilloried in both the press and by the Minister for Magic for supporting Harry's version of events.

</li><li> The series offers more poignant examples in the form of Frank Bryce. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He took a stand against Voldemort, but no one was there to see it and he died alone.

In fact, if any of said battles became known to an outsider, it would automatically become a sound defeat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: This is how it is for all of the clone troopers. Non-clones can't tell them apart, many have no idea that they even <em>are</em> individuals (unless they work with them on a regular basis)—for all intents and purposes, they are the same. Which means that any heroism that an individual clone performs will be forgotten in the grand scheme of the entire army. In one novel, <em>The Cestus Deception</em>, a clone named Nate berates a woman who rants at him for his apparent lack of empathy.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nate:</strong> Men like me protect you. <br/><strong>Sheeka:</strong> From other men like you. <br/><strong>Nate:</strong> No. Men like me don't start the wars. We just die in them. We've always died in them, and we always will. We don't expect any praise for it, no parades. No one knows our names. In fact, by your standards, we have no names at all... We don't have names, and no one will ever know who we are. But <em>we</em> do. We always do.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em>, this is the fate of King Eahlstan Fiskerne and his battle with the great red dragon, Shurakai. Beloved as he was, it is only known publicly that the dragon killed him, and that decades later, Prester John came and finally slew the dragon, ascending to the kingship as a result. The League of the Scroll (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the Sithi</a>), however, preserve the true secret of the Fiskerne line: <em>he</em> killed the dragon, taking his death-wound in the process. John took his sword Minneyar, renamed it Bright-Nail, and claimed to be the dragon's killer. This lie festers beneath the plot like an untreated wound and is largely responsible for the Sithi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">failure to come to the aid</a> of humanity in its struggle against the Storm King until it's almost too late.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVanguard">Star Trek: Vanguard</a> series concerns itself with this (focusing on a highly classified Starfleet operation in the Taurus Reach), particularly given that one of its characters, Tim Pennington, is a journalist trying to get the facts made public. One of the books in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheLostEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheLostEra">Star Trek: The Lost Era</a> demonstrates that a century after Project Vanguard the existence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a> at the heart of it all is common knowledge in the Federation, at least on the level of "they were here", but much of what the characters did in the Taurus Reach remains unacknowledged. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTyphonPact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTyphonPact">Star Trek: Typhon Pact</a></em> novel <em>Paths of Disharmony</em> features classified records of Project Vanguard as an essential part of its plot, confirming that although some of the events are widely known (the Tholians won't let the memories die, for one thing), much of the true picture is deeply buried beyond the reach of anyone but the highest members of the Federation government and Starfleet Command. The final page of the Vanguard series finale, <em>Storming Heaven</em>, pretty much confirms that this trope is the major theme of the series.
</li><li> A secondary character in <em>Area 7</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewReilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewReilly">Matthew Reilly</a> is a brilliant computer analyst and mathematician, at one point cracking a supposedly uncrackable encryption for the CIA. However, since you can't let your opponent know you've broken his encryption, his highest honor was a medal and a pat on the back.
</li><li> This is the life story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a>. He saves the world, or at least the country, over and over and over again, and all he gets is everyone thinking that he's a "druggie" because he misses school all the time <em>in order to save their lives.</em>
</li><li> In <em>The Barrow</em> this trope is initially averted as Stjepan makes sure that the family and friends of the people who died in their expedition to the first barrow, all know what happened and how everyone died. However, it is played straight in the end of the book as the expedition to the second barrow ends up costing most of the characters their lives and what happened there will be only known to a few key people who will keep it secret. In fact, a number of brave and honorable knights who died on the expedition will instead be remembered back home as traitors and renegades because they never got the chance to return and clear their names.
</li><li> Jean Valjean's exploits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em> is epic yet he dies in obscurity. The epilogue is clear that his grave hasn't been visited in a while.
</li><li> The plot of the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PermutationCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PermutationCity">Permutation City</a></em> is to create a fully functional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsideAComputerSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsideAComputerSystem">simulated reality</a>. They succeed, but nobody will ever know. Once the computer is turned off, the resulting universe is forever separated from the real world, so its inhabitants can never communicate with the original universe. Even worse, because the leader of the operation has questionable sanity and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills himself once the task is complete</span>, everybody else involved thinks he's just delusional and accomplished nothing. For these reasons, nobody knows about the events of the novel's second half, set entirely within the simulated universe, either.
</li><li> It's noted at the end of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousBenedictSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousBenedictSociety">The Mysterious Benedict Society</a></em> book that the government covered up the children's achievements saving the world.

As saving Alia in the first place and bringing her to Themiscyra could mean banishment, Diana keeps her adventure to herself. The oracle, who is the only other person on Themiscyra that knows about everything, swears to keep quiet.

Namely, while the rest of the cast is in a battle to save the universe with each character getting a high drama moment, Xander escapes from a gang of reanimated corpses, <strike> roots</strike> gets rooted by Faith, then works out the gang had built a bomb and plan to blow up the school. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. As the rest of the cast was fighting in the school to stop the Hellmouth from opening, the bomb would have killed them and allowed the Hellmouth to stay open. Near the end of the same episode, the other characters (unwittingly) lampshade the fact that they never got to see Xander kill most of the gang and make the leader stop the bomb with the line "The world will never know how close it came to ending last night".
<ul><li> "I'm oddly full for some reason." Oz was going out of control as a werewolf and was placed in the school basement, where he eats the gang leader after Xander makes him switch off the bomb.
</li><li> Perfect capper to this episode; all throughout the episode, Cordelia has been making snide comments to Xander about how useless and redundant he is, which has affected his confidence. In the end, she sneers another one at him... only this time, he just smirks back and walks away. Cordelia, flustered, is reduced to yelling "What? <em>What</em>?!" at his back. He doesn't answer, realizing that he is, in fact, Made of Win and doesn't need anyone's validation to be sure of it.
</li><li> Also virtually every slayer that ever lived. Very few people know they exist, they routinely put their lives on the line to save people and are almost certainly going to die very young and very messily. At one point, Buffy is trying to research how previous slayers died (in order to avert it herself) and discovers that even the secret records kept by their Watchers are pretty sparse on the details of how most of them met their end. She brings it up with Giles, who reasons that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeADaughterToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeADaughterToMe">if they were anything like him, the Watchers simply found it ''too painful'' to record the details of the how the slayer died</a>, so the stories go mostly untold.

With the exception of Jon Pertwee's tenure as the Doctor (most of which was spent with him stranded on Earth) the Doctor rarely, if ever, sticks around after saving the world/galaxy/universe, with only a handful of survivors to know that he even exists, let alone about his involvement. On the other hand, he has justified this as far as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks">"The Power of the Daleks"</a>  he just doesn't want to get stuck with the bill.

Thus, even though they managed to carry over, they technically shouldn't exist in the new world, meaning that none of their friends remember who they are, and there are already people living the lives they could have in the new world.

<ul><li> "The Voyage Home" revolved around a trio of astronauts traveling back to Earth from Mars. Earlier, two of the astronauts had been replaced by aliens, leaving just the one human who eventually learns about the impostor. Forced to choose between making it back to Earth and the fame and glory he would receive and preventing the alien species from spreading to Earth, the final astronaut finally decides to be a hero and sabotages the re-entry procedure causing the ship to burn up, with Ground Control believing it to be a disastrous malfunction. The ending narration: "The true measure of a hero is when a man lays down his life with the knowledge that those he saves... will never know." However, the episode "The Voice of Reason" reveals the ship's black box was recovered and recordings of the incident are played for a government committee.
</li><li> Although not referenced as blatantly by the narrator, "Feasibility Study" ends similarly, with an entire suburban community of alien abductees choosing to expose themselves to a deadly virus, so they'll all die and their abductors will conclude that humans can't survive on their planet, hence are unsuitable as slaves. The closing scenes show the abductees all holding hands in death, while baffled people back on Earth stare anxiously at the barren gap where the stolen neighborhood used to be, mercifully ignorant of how they've been spared <em>en masse</em> enslavement.
</li><li> In "Better Luck Next Time", two detectives are used as pawns by two men possessed by evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surfing</a> aliens. After tricking one detective into shooting the other, the aliens confess that they have been murdering and playing games to trick people into killing each other for centuries. To stop them, the detectives shoot the aliens' host bodies, then the surviving one shoots herself. Since they are in a big empty warehouse, the aliens are unable to find new host bodies before they disintegrate in Earth's atmosphere. Without any evidence, when their bodies are found, no one will know that they stopped two mass murderers and everyone will likely think the detectives went mad, killed two people, then themselves.

In one episode, though ("Stirred"), he stops sponsoring an Internet education bill that's been his pet project for years, because the Republican-controlled Congress doesn't want to pass such a popular bill with the Democratic VP's name attached to it while he and the president are running for reelection.
<ul><li> Also notable because most of the White House senior staff spend the episode considering whether or not they want to replace Hoynes on the ticket, and it's revealed near the end of the episode that Hoynes was able to guess what they were doing.

He does all the legwork to get a Democrat who's willing to also co-sponsor, and (after having to write up a letter of resignation because one of his earlier attempts embarrassed the White House) the staff discover that both senators won't do it unless they can say they approached each other.

<ul><li> The entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> features this. It's made fairly clear from the get-go that neither the Council or the Alliance know or care what you're doing against the Collectors. All you've got is yourself, the Illusive Man and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">your crew of unstable maniacs</a> and if you all die in the ensuing suicide mission, no-one will probably know until it's too late.

</li><li> Invoked by Jacob when he tells Shepard about his background and what he did to get noticed and recruited by Cerberus - stopping an assassination plot on the Citadel that was covered up for political reasons. As he puts it:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Jacob</strong>: "Good deeds are like pissing yourself in dark pants - warm feeling but nobody notices"

One mission had them find a group of pirates who had taken hostages. The team managed to assassinate their leader, leaving the pirates to turn on one another, while they got the hostages out unharmed, with the pirates none the wiser. Hearing this story, Liam asks what's the point of doing good deeds if no-one knows. Cora replies "<em>I</em> know."
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> game <em>Imperishable Night</em>, the real incident is not the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds">unending night</a>; that's actually a spell that the <em>protagonists</em> are casting to buy time so that they can resolve the problem of the corrupted full moon. However, it appears that only the protagonists you choose, the villains causing the corrupted moon, and possibly Keine, know about this. Everyone else assumes that the imperishable night is the true incident; indeed, the stage four boss is either Reimu or Marisa, who confront your characters to end the imperishable night in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Danmaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Danmaku">usual way</a>, thinking you to be the "final boss".
<ul><li> This happens often in Gensokyou, actually. Many of the incidents are found and solved outside the public's knowledge, which makes it a bit hard for Reimu when no one comes to donate to her...
</li></ul></li><li> This happens every time you do one of the story missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infamous">Infamous</a></em>, both the voice of survival and the USTV network providing different stories as to what happened. A particular example is the first train mission to save a bunch of civilians from the abandoned trains: the voice claims it was a "group of concerned citizens" and also trashes Cole and USTV says something about a bunch of paratroopers that didn't exist
<ul><li> It is a justified trope, as in Truth's last message <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's made clear that it was Kessler who was keeping him quiet.</span>
</li><li> It's heavily implied that while the rest of the country doesn't know about Cole's existence, the citizens of Empire City know who their hero is. This is enforced by the times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2">the sequel</a> where side missions will involve people who know he helped specific people in the first game and thank him for it, and of course by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">end of the game</a>, everyone in the city knows about what Cole did for them.

After the end of the second game only a few people know the truth about what happened: what's left of SRPA, Capelli, and Malikov.
</li><li> Despite what Rance has done to the whole world, no one really knows about him.

In the other endings in which he makes it out safely with whatever survivors he's rounded up, the epilogue states that he was able to write several articles on the events at Willamette themselves, but then again, never learned the truth behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>.
<ul><li> The official ending states that, as with any society overflowing with information, America quickly forgot about the Willamette Incident.
</li><li> The sequel, however, ignores the endings in which this happens, though Frank isn't famous regardless.

Throughout the game, the player follows Nichols' footsteps through these time periods, who boasts that what he found would make him and the player famous. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out at the end that Atlantis does exist, being built on top of a giant sunken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip">Drop Ship</a>, three genetic pods were manufactured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">benevolent aliens</a> to elevate the 3 civilizations, and that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">hostile robot</a> had trapped Nichols inside the time gates. This trope plays straight when you set him free, leaving Nichols empty-handed with no more than fantastic stories to tell.

They also save many people along the way such as the victims of an incredibly corrupt nobleman. The only people who know of all their deeds and are not actually members of Brave Vesperia can be counted on one hand. Granted some of them are very important people but it is implied that the protagonist at least never gets the recognition he is due because of the circumstances. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Namely Yuri allows Flynn to take the credit for most of his accomplishments, and by extension Brave Vesperia's, because this allows Flynn to affect change from within the system in a position of strength. Due to taking all their credit, Flynn gets promoted to Commandant in the end, head of the Empire's armed forces and now has the authority to affect lasting change.

At the end of the ritual, Lexi is sucked through the portal as an unwilling sacrifice.

<ul><li> In recounting the history of the Battle of the Bulge (during World War 2), one historian says with regret that it proved to be impossible to track down all the stories of heroism during the early phases of the battle, as most of the records were lost in the confusion. He describes one such action, in particular, with the following words:
<div class="indent"> A platoon of engineers appears in one terse sentence of a German commander's report. They have fought bravely, says the foe, and forced him to waste a couple of hours in deployment and maneuver. In this brief emergence from the fog of war, the engineer platoon makes its bid for recognition in history. That is all.
</div></li><li> The 1925 serum run to Nome, Alaska was run by some 150 dogs and 20 mushers, and the run saved the city of Nome from an epidemic. Now, the only one at all known was the lead dog of the last leg, Balto; this is regardless of the fact that Togo led the run on the longest leg, almost twice as long as the next longest, and also the most dangerous.
</li><li> Averted now, but for years and years after World War II, Alan Turing and the rest of Bletchley Park weren't allowed to tell anyone about what they had done - namely working on deciphering intercepted messages which had been encrypted using Enigma. This meant they were despised as cowards for not fighting rather than recognized as just as vital to the war effort as the soldiers. Nowadays, fortunately, the site in Buckinghamshire has been turned into a museum so that visitors can learn about what went on there.
<ul><li> This was reasonable, as the techniques developed at Bletchley remained useful for a long time after the war. In fact, the Allies allowed Enigma-based encryption technology to be sold in the developing world just because they knew how to crack the codes.
</li><li> What makes this worse is Alan Turing's conviction for buggery, sentencing to chemical castration and eventual suicide. One wonders if had his work been known, he might have been given some amnesty and survived. Thankfully, Turing has <em>finally</em> gotten his due and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/alan-turing-gets-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html">received a royal pardon for his "crime".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> At least now he's receiving the recognition he rightfully deserves.
</li><li> Ironically, few people outside Poland realize that the task undertaken in Bletchley Park would've been much harder without the contribution of Polish cryptographers stationed in Kabaty (currently the southernmost part of Warsaw) before the war. Their role in decoding the Enigma is known mostly to historians specializing in WWII history, although they've been gaining recognition in recent years.
</li></ul></li><li> For about 10 years, the story of Russian Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov was this. In 1983 (during an extremely tense period in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>), Petrov's new system for detecting a nuclear weapons launch at Russia incorrectly showed a missile being fired by the US and heading toward Russia. Petrov correctly believed that it was a system glitch, but the story remained buried and untold to the Russian public until the '90s and didn't become widely known in the US until 2006.<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov">Link to that other wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11gm0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11gm0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11gm0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The reason he figured it was a system glitch was because <em>there weren't enough missiles to be a US attack</em>.</span>

</li><li> Terence S. Kirk was a Japanese POW in WWII. Now, this is a very undesirable position on its own, but what he did, with the help of a handful of collaborators, was secretly make an improvised camera and document what happened, so that it could be used in court about war crimes. Once he got out, he showed it to the authorities, who then gave him a gag order not to discuss what happened, which he reluctantly signed. He then complied with the gag order for many years, but later defied it and published the pictures and his memoir. You can read about it in the book <em>The Secret Camera</em>.

The truth is that nothing happened because computer scientists and engineers fixed everything before they <em>could</em> go wrong, and while admittedly the world was not going to end either way there was likely going to be major inconvenience for a few weeks if no action was taken. Unfortunately, people outside the computer industry tend not to know of the effort put in.
