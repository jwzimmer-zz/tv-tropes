He completely fails to notice a lack of evolving, the whole "gradual growth" thing he has going, the lack of special abilities, the fact that his name doesn't end in "-mon", and the fact that he bleeds. Also, somehow, he talks like Tarzan despite most Digimon being quite well-spoken. The fact that he was raised by a living female snowman from quite an early age and really should have frozen to death upon being rocked to sleep one too many times is never even addressed.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HungryHeartWildStriker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HungryHeartWildStriker">Hungry Heart: Wild Striker</a></em>, protagonist Kyosuke Kanou was this during his early childhood, as his biological parents died in a car crash when he was a baby.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played rather straight in the French comic book <em>Les 5 Mondes de Sylfeline</em>. The human heroine, Sylfeline, is reared by Douniais (basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">pudgy gnomes</a>) and believes herself to be one of them until told the truth on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousSixteenthBirthday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousSixteenthBirthday">sixteenth birthday</a>...despite being twice as tall as her adoptive parents (and five-fingered unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands">four-fingered</a> Douniais).
</li><li> Subverted in the French manga-style comic book <em>Appa</em>. The eponymous heroine is called by her father on his deathbed, who starts saying that he has an important reveal to make to her. When she realizes he's about to tell her that she is a foundling, she points out that she noticed they were different a <em>long</em> time ago. (She's a little human girl, her adoptive parents are <em>anthropomorphic walruses</em>.) The father is quite upset by this fact, ranting that he wouldn't have agonized for so long over not telling her sooner if he'd known, while the mother rolls her eyes.
</li><li> Similarly spoofed in a strip by French comic book artist <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Bret%C3%A9cher">Claire Bretécher.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> A couple tries to explain to their (young adult) children that they were adopted, being apologetic that they've waited so long to tell them. The parents are white, the son is Asian and the daughter is black, yet both were oblivious. When finally clued in that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>, however, they immediately and happily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetARoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetARoom">Get a Room!</a>.
</li><li> The French comics <em>Les Psys</em> ("<em>The Shrinks</em>") has a couple bring in their kid for help because though they never told him he's adopted, he got that yelled at him by other kids on the playground and he's been asking himself if he is. Since the parents would rather wait until he's older to tell him, the shrink goes into the consulting room and asks the kid why he thinks he's adopted (kid's black, parents are white).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>'s retelling of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s origin, Martha Kent, who had suffered two miscarriages and a stillbirth, was horrified that anyone would shoot off a rocket with a little baby in it. She claimed to have given birth to Clark, and she and Jonathan preserved the secret throughout his childhood — which, naturally, meant keeping it from Clark. Only when Clark's powers started to emerge did Jonathan confess. In this version of the retelling, they were able to get away with it due to Smallville suffering a blizzard soon after they found Clark that kept them inside for weeks, and due to her previous miscarriages, the neighbors bought that she wouldn't have shared news of her latest pregnancy until the kid was actually born.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, where, during the New Power story arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taranee</span> finds out she's adopted, as her parents had to give her up when she was a baby when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">magic summoned a meteor from the sky to burn evil vines trying to kill her, burning up the home in the process.</a></span> Her adoptive parents had planned to tell her later and kept track of where her birth parents are so she could meet them, but she made clear she considers them her real parents.

He later himself adopt a tiger-striped <em>fish</em> as his son. Unlike other examples of this trope, Maurice never <em>ever</em> clues in that he's not a fierce tiger, even after meeting some other penguins (whom he considers "silly-looking birds"). He goes as far as regularly painting yellow stripes on his black plumage to keep the tiger look.

It just never seemed to occur to him that there was a reason he looked nothing like his adoptive father or the rest of the family for that matter. He just figured he was "long-boned," and had some sort of skin condition and a "speech impediment".
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules">Hercules</a></em> has this trope in full force, with the accidentally-exiled baby god being taken in by childless mortals, only to grow up feeling weird and ostracized because of his excessive strength.

She spends most of the movie trying to sort out her species identity crisis with fellow mammoth Manny's help.

</li><li> Ike on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> is an interesting example: while Ike himself is just a baby, his older brother Kyle was apparently unaware that Ike was really adopted from Canada, though Canadians on <em>South Park</em> are animated differently than Americans. Subverted somewhat in that <em>the viewer</em> couldn't be sure of this, either; this episode is basically what established that rule, though Canadians had been shown animated differently before (on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>, which could have been another explanation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">the style difference</a>).

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> had a duckling imprint on Tom and remain oblivious to Tom's attempts to eat him (despite Jerry repeatedly saving him and trying to illustrate the difference between cats and ducks). When the duckling finally figures things out, he decides to let Tom eat him anyway, though of course Tom can't bring himself to do it and, at the end of the episode, <em>actually</em> takes the duckling in.
</li><li> The trope is pushed to an extreme level of silliness in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TrollsDeTroy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TrollsDeTroy">Trolls de Troy</a></em>. The heroine, Waha, is a human girl who was adopted by a family of trolls (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">in this world, big, hairy, smelly, man-eating humanoids</a>). She <em>stays</em> utterly oblivious to this fact (unlike in the original comic, where her adoptive father reveals the truth to her in the first issue, when they desperately need her to use magic). In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">she responds with violence</a> to the mere suggestion that she could be human. Instead, she thinks of herself as a troll with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">"thwarted pilosity"</a> — and the other trolls believe it too! Of course, trolls are notoriously stupid and scatterbrained, but even <em>her adoptive parents</em> seem to have forgotten about the little matter of her adoption. The worst part, however, is that even every human she encounters (admittedly, barely smarter than the trolls in general) also swallows the "hairless troll" story. This includes an experienced troll hunter (who wants to add her head to his trophy wall) and a "trollologist" (but he is crazy anyway). Chances of Waha ever realizing her true heritage? Zero.

He speaks English with a British accent, despite being raised by Chinese immigrants. He's also 50 years old despite being a child, physically.

It turns out to be an ostrich egg, but Foghorn still thinks he gave birth to the ostrich, without question.
</li><li> Bloom of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> was sent to Earth and adopted by Mike and Vanessa when her home planet was under attack; in the process of such, she lost her memory and thought they were her parents.

To this end, he was taught sign language, lived at the university campus, and frequently ate human food. After an incident where the now-adolescent (and quite sizable) Chantek escaped his enclosure and startled a female student, he was removed from the university and placed in a research centre, before eventually being moved on to the Zoo Atlanta. When he encountered other orangutans for the first time in his life and a caretaker asked him what they were, he signed, "orange dogs", and did not seem to associate them with himself.
