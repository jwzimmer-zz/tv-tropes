</div></div><p>When an election is the main plot of the story, it is inevitably decided by one vote. This can manifest itself in several different ways:
</p><p>1. The antagonist candidate is declared to have won by one vote. The main characters of the show realize that, in the excitement of the plot, they themselves forgot to vote. Usually, the episode began with the characters trying to convince someone that voting is important. Thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> is delivered.

The vote is discovered to be tied, or very close, but there's still a small amount of time left to vote. A race against the clock ensues.
</p><p>3. The vote is discovered to be a tie, one person has yet to vote, and they vote unexpectedly.
</p><p>4. One person's vote is counted multiple times. This version is most common in business settings in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorityShareDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorityShareDictator">one person holds the "controlling share" (over 50%) of the company's stock</a>.
</p><p>Note that any one of these can also have an additional scenario attached to the final vote - one character, either out of ignorance or some moral principle, refuses to vote for themselves and votes for their opponent instead. This one vote will ironically be their undoing as they discover that their opponent did not share this mentality. This may also happen due to a character believing a vote for themselves is unfair or even not realizing they can actually vote for themselves. It may also include an epiphany where one of the candidates realizes at the last moment that they don't deserve to win and votes for their opponent instead, thus ensuring their own defeat for the greater good.

The poll remained neck and neck the entire time, neither side achieving a lead of more than four votes at any point. As time ticked closer to the deadline, supporters of both girls took to social media to convince others to vote for their waifu, resulting in almost 40 votes being cast in the last three hours. The poll literally came down to the wire, and Nora won with a last-second vote putting her ahead 134-133.

Mayor Tilton then voted for himself, bringing the election to a tie. Stanley then showed up and pointed out that he was so busy being the Mask... 's campaign manager he still hasn't voted. When Mayor Tilton asks Stanley to vote for him, Stanley asked in return that Mayor Tilton remove the extra parking meters, reduce the fee to renew dog licenses and end the garbagemen's strike.

</li><li> A rather (in-universe) infuriating version happens in <em>Lupo Alberto</em> when they hold elections for the farms' leader.

It looks looks like they'll have to vote again between the tied candidates, with Moses as the tiebreaker... Then the neutral ballot judge notices that Glicerina, the farm's fool, <em>has voted for all of them and signed his ballot</em>, and when they have him decide for only one he votes for Enrico because he accepts to change his planned river of milk and honey in one of milk and chocolate.

The electoral college vote results in a tie between the two major party candidates (with Beth, the outsider candidate, winning a single state), so the election goes to a vote in Congress. As the result of the vote isn't final until one candidate gets a majority, one of the state delegations hits on the idea of casting its vote for Beth and seeing which of the major parties will offer a better deal to get them to change it. This tactic is rapidly adopted by other delegations, pushing up Beth's vote and briefly horrifying the political fixers with the prospect of a complete political unknown being elected <em>accidentally</em>, before the rise halts with Beth one vote short of the necessary majority. And then Delaware, having decided that neither of the major party candidates is particularly desirable, chooses to take a chance on the unknown and <em>deliberately</em> casts one more vote for Beth, ending the election with her as winner.

(His phone has been cut off, so the candidates even make TV commercials directed at him.) Eventually, he moderates a debate between the two, asking questions sent in by voters nationwide, and ultimately makes a decision, however the decision is not revealed.

He instead informs the Senate Majority Leader he will nominate his own Secretary of State, so the vote fails.

This being the mountainous region of Frostbite Falls, he was of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">referring to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">an actual landslide</a>, which trapped Bullwinkle in the building where the vote was taking place and prevented anyone else from getting to it. Bullwinkle responded by saying that Rocky was the winner, since that was who he actually voted for.

</li><li> Plot point in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> episode, "It's Good to be the Queen". Stan came with Francine to her reunion only caring that he's married to the homecoming queen. Francine had won by one vote against Betty Sue who became devastated is currently obese. It is revealed that two ballots were uncounted both for Betty Sue. Francine had never won causes Stan to freak out and decides to go out with Betty Sue.

Still unable to decide, she holds the Gecko Games to decide which one will get this last deciding vote.

</p><ul><li> In running campaigns to try to get people to go out to vote, politicians will sometimes trot out as a statistic the number of elections that have been decided by one vote within a particular city, state, province, etc. as a means of convincing people their vote matters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI">Louis XVI</a> was the subject of several votes after being imprisoned during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, but the vote which decided upon his immediate execution was (essentially) 360-to-361.
</li><li> The Vice President of the United States also serves as the President of the Senate, but only gets a vote when the votes from the senators are tied, making any vote in which the VP is involved fall under this.
</li><li> During the impeachment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJohnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, he was ultimately acquitted by the senate by a vote of 19 vs 35, coming up just short of the 36 vote supermajority (2/3 of votes) required by US law to convict the President.
</li><li> The 1876 United States presidential election between Republican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RutherfordBHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RutherfordBHayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. While Tilden received a majority of the popular vote, Hayes beat him in the Electoral College 185 to 184, including 20 disputed votes. The disputed votes were the result of double returns for votes in three states and an illegal elector in a fourth. These votes were given to Hayes two days before his inauguration, on the condition that federal troops be withdrawn from the South, ending the Reconstruction Era. The decision to reward the votes to Hayes was <em>also</em> decided by one vote, as the Electoral Commission voted 8-7 in favor of Hayes.
</li><li> A non-political example in pro baseball: After a pitcher-dominated 1960's that saw scoring down and fan interest begin to wane, the American League voted to adopt the designated hitter rule that would allow fielders to bat in place of the pitcher (who usually sucks at the plate), leading to an increase in offense in the AL and fan attendance perking up again in the 1970's. This led to the National League considering whether to adopt the rule as well. A vote took place in 1980, where among the twelve NL teams there needed to be more "Yes" than "No" votes for it to pass. Originally, Philadelphia Phillies vice president Bill Giles intended to vote "yes", but he wasn't sure if his boss owner Ruly Carpenter wanted to still support it once the teams were informed that the rule wouldn't go into effect until 1982, and he couldn't get in contact with Carpenter because he was on a fishing trip. Without confirmation from his boss, Giles abstained from the vote instead; this in turn caused Pittsburgh Pirates general manager Harding Peterson to also abstain as he had been instructed to follow the Phillies' lead. The measure failed, with four votes in favor, five against, and three abstentions. Years later it was revealed that Carpenter <em>did</em> want to have the DH, but for want of a telephone line rather than a fishing line the NL still has pitchers batting to this day.
</li><li> The United Kingdom local elections in 2017 saw Northumberland County Council remain in no overall control<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1tfk7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1tfk7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1tfk7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">meaning no party has overall control of the council</span>. However, this was due to the Conservatives literally drawing a short straw - South Blyth saw a tie between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, and if this happens, a tie-break is held with that counting as an extra vote. Had the Liberal Democrat candidate drawn the short straw, the Conservatives would have won that seat and, with it, overall control of Northumberland County Council.
</li><li> A double example occurred in the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrat-wins-one-vote-virginia-legislative-election-recount-234625991.html">2017 Virginia House of Delegates elections<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. After a recount, Democratic candidate Shelly Simonds won her seat by a single vote, and her election in turn resulted in a 50-50 split in the House of Delegates, replacing Republican control of the chamber with a power-sharing arrangement...until a panel of judges ruled a previously discarded ballot was declared a valid vote for Republican incumbent David Yancey<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mpxu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mpxu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mpxu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the ballot in question had bubbles filled in for both candidates, but because they chose the Republican in every other election, the judges ruled that they intended to vote for Yancey in the House race as well</span>. votes were counted <em>again</em> and it was discovered that the result was a tie. The winner was decided by a name being pulled out of a bowl, which ultimately was Yanceys, allowing them to maintain a very narrow majority. However, in 2019, courts would order several districts redrawn including the tied district. The new district was replaced by one much more Democratic than the old one, and Simonds ran again that year and won her race.
</li><li> Before deciding to file the landmark <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> case on behalf of a black school whose students suffered from terrible conditions detrimental to learning, the NAACP decided to put it to a vote among the students they were going to be representing: did they want to pursue integration, or to fight for the actual equal treatment to which they were entitled under Separate But Equal? <a class="urllink" href="https://www.virginiahistory.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/civil-rights-movement-virginia/brown-i-and-brown">Integration won, by a single vote.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
