Lina is fairly stunned. Leads to a quick conversation in another novel. Lina discovers Zuuma is back... and has all his arms. Gourry's response? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shit.</span>

When Zommari tries to take advantage of the fact Byakuya's now stuck fighting him one-legged, he learns Byakuya's speed is still incredible but manages to take control of Byakuya's left hand and tries to strangle Byakuya with his own hand. Byakuya again doesn't hesitate and immediately severs the tendons and muscles in his left hand as well. Byakuya's then forced to finish the fight one-legged and one-armed.

</li><li> Zoro likes this trope: his go-to solution for problems is "cut a limb off". Luckily when he's handcuffed to Usopp and suggests they do rock paper scissors to decide who cuts off their hand, Usopp is able to squash this idea before he begins. Zoro apparently thinks this is a good idea because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">he's sure their doctor can reattach the thing just fine.</a>
</li><li> "Red Leg" Zeff on the other hand was forced to sever his own leg in order to avoid starving to death by eating it (manga) or in order to save a drowning Sanji (anime). Badass either way.

He blames Superman for it, which matches the event shown later in mainstream continuity, but it is unclear if it was this trope or not, since it is implied that Superman did it as punishment for his pursuing his vigilantism against government orders.

He tells the kidnapper not to bother trying to cut through the handcuffs since he wouldn't be able to make it in time, and then he stands outside, watching to see if the guy manages to escape. He doesn't. They changed this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">the movie</a> because they were worried that people would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">be reminded too much of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a>.</em> Instead Rorschach simply cleaves his head open, which is the same thing he just did to the man's dog ("Men get arrested.

</li><li> In an issue of Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersTheInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersTheInitiative">The Initiative</a></em>, trainee superhero Komodo's legs are injected with poison, which will kill her when it reaches her heart. Her teammate Hardball decides that the best way to deal with this under the current dire circumstances is to amputate the legs. Komodo can regenerate, of course, but this still triggers a phobic reaction, as her civilian form lost her legs as well.

He somehow gets free, leaving the empty, foot-shaped gaps drenched in his blood, but precisely how much of his feet he'd also left behind isn't clear.
</li><li> In the comic book backstory for Lieutenant Jean Rasczak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>, the young marine is the only soldier survivor of the first encounter with the bugs. As he hauls ass back into the dropship, one of the Warrior Bugs traps his arm with its mandibles and attempts to pull him back out. He orders the terrified civilian survivor to seal the door — doing so severs his arm but saves his life.

It's particularly cruel because if you watch the movie closely you'll notice that it doesn't matter which choice the cuffed bad guy makes, there isn't time for him to do either: From speech to explosion is about 3 minutes tops. That said, it could be just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicCountdown">movie time</a> — not like it even matters, he'd bleed to death before he could possibly find anyone to treat the wound. This is a particularly special bit of ironic punishment as well — the gang member in question, Johnny the Boy, crippled Max's best friend Goose by forcing him to lose control of his vehicle and then setting him on fire via the leaking fuel while Goose was trapped inside and struggling to free himself. Once Max chains Johnny to the wrecked car he was gutting, he rigs it to explode using the stream of leaking gasoline and Johnny's own lighter.

</li><li> Coyotes are supposed to chew their own leg off if they get caught in a trap. This leads to the expression "coyote moment". Probably irrelevant, it's about dating: "When you wake up with them sleeping on your arm, and would rather chew it off than wake them."
</li><li> Many lizards have tails that cleanly break away from their bodies when a predator grabs them by it. Often the tail continues to twitch after such self-amputation, as a further distraction for the predator. Interestingly enough, this can sometimes be a win-win for both the lizard and the predator; not only does the lizard escape with its life, but the predator will occasionally settle for eating the lizard's tail after it breaks off.
</li><li> Sloughing off the skin of one's tail when it's grabbed or caught on something is a common defense for many long-tailed rodents:
<ul><li> The skin around a gerbil's tail can fall off to let it escape from predators. The internal skeletal structure falls off a couple days later.
</li><li> If you see a squirrel with a less-fluffy tail than usual, that's probably what happened to it.
</li><li> This (along with terrible pain) is why pet rats should never be lifted by their tails.

While mountain climbing, one of his arms got trapped under a fallen boulder... so he cut it off. With a <em>penknife</em>. <em>A <strong>dull</strong> penknife</em>. It was sharp when he started out, but he first tried to use it as a lever to get the rock off, dulling the blade. He had to snap the bone completely in two before he could start cutting. Even worse, Aron decided to wait a few days, hopeful that someone would come and rescue him. No one ever came. So he had to cut off his own arm, with a dull penknife, <em>while dying of thirst</em>. And <em>then</em> he had to survive climbing back down the mountain! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is he waited the exact right amount of time. Any longer, and he would have been too weak to reach help before dying of blood loss. Any earlier, and the search would not have been developed enough to get him medivaced in time once he did find help to save him from bleeding out. This incident has been made into a 2010 movie: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredAndTwentySevenHours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredAndTwentySevenHours">127 Hours</a></em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco">James Franco</a>.
</li><li> In 2010, a similar thing happened to a man named Jonathan Metz, whose arm became trapped behind his boiler when he tried to clean behind it. He realized that not only was he going to die if he didn't cut his arm off, so was his pet beagle Portia, who was wandering around upstairs, hungry and confused as to why he he had disappeared and whose barking fits were becoming shorter and less frequent, coinciding with his own weakening state. Much like the Ralston example, his timing was perfect—the arm hand become gangrened enough that it was relatively painless, and police and EMS crews were converging on his house, alerted by friends who were alarmed by his disappearance.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1g2nz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1g2nz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1g2nz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His story was featured on the show <em>I Survived</em>, and, in case you're wondering, the dog survived as well.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>: During the Manhattan Project to create the first atomic bomb, it was stated that if you accidentally poked a limb with a plutonium-contaminated tool, the only recourse was swift amputation.
</li><li> There was one instance of a man who caught a ball of cobalt-60 and had his hand amputated. This would not have been necessary as Plutonium nuclides are actually pretty benign, as far as radiation goes. However, this was not known at the time, like most of the properties of plutonium (which was only just available in macroscopic quantities, and only because of the bomb effort itself). The two incidents with the Demon Core only served to further elevate fears about the lethality of the stuff.
</li><li> Any war before WWII, when antibiotic drugs were invented. Before antibiotics, gangrene was almost unpreventable when wounds got infected. In fact, the civil war hospital where a guy gets a shot of whiskey and a block of wood to bite on while they saw off his legs should be a trope of its own. Considering the effect that .75 caliber Civil War era bullets would have on an arm or a leg, you could get shot today in the most advanced hospital available and still lose the affected limb.
</li><li> Horrifically subverted in Sierra Leone's own civil war, when rebel war criminals would ask their victims, "Short sleeves or long?", then amputate their hands at either the elbow (short) or the wrist (long). Either way, victims' survival depended on whether the bleeding could be stopped, not on what they chose. Some rebels practiced a straight version of the trope, merely asking "Hand or head".
</li><li> Crossed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkComedy">Dark Comedy</a> in the warnings on some large woodchippers — something to the effect of "Do not stick arms or legs into machine — machine can pull you in faster than you can let go of limb."
</li><li> Occasionally invoked by rescue workers to retrieve victims of auto pileups or collapsed buildings.
</li><li> Emergency medical responders have the basic rule "Life over limb." While this doesn't usually involve amputation, it does mean that given the choice between risk of death by not moving them because they have an unsecured spinal injury as opposed to moving them out of the immediate life-threatening situation and risking spinal damage, well, they might end up in a wheelchair but they'll be alive to do so.

</li><li> Frostbite occurs when someone's physiology makes a Life Or Limb Decision of its own, withdrawing blood flow from the extremities in a desperate attempt to keep the body's core, and the vital organs inside, from freezing. Better to sacrifice digits, earlobes, nose or even whole hands and feet than to lose the brain or viscera.

</li><li> For years, it was believed that this would be the case if one had to apply a tourniquet for more than a few minutes. Tourniquets will stop bleeding by cutting off circulation to the limb, and it was long assumed that this would result in loss of said limb (or at least part of it) if left in place long enough. For this reason, tourniquets were only recommended in cases where a person's life was in danger from bleeding out of a wound (a literal life-or-limb situation). However, recent research conducted by the US military has proven that a tourniquet can be safely left in place for up to 45 minutes without requiring amputation. Tourniquets are now recommended in cases where direct pressure has not controlled the bleeding, and the patient will reach the hospital within 45 minutes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a>: At least some bugs are able to detach a limb to save themselves without too much fuss. They've got more of them to spare than we do, and some — spiders, for example — are able to regenerate lost limbs. This is demonstrated often by pest control glue-traps, in which it's not uncommon to find a lone cockroach leg with no sign of its original owner.
</li><li> This is often why glue pads are not considered to be a humane alternative for mouse traps if you want to catch the mouse without killing it. If not found and released in time, a desperate mouse might try to chew its limbs off to escape, and consequently bleed out, and that's if it doesn't die from the stress.
</li><li> During the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake">1989 Loma Prieta earthquake<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a portion of the upper deck of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed. Rescue workers had no choice but to cut through the body of a woman to extract her son from their crushed car, eventually amputating his right leg as well.
</li><li> When she was an infant, young British girl <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5hrVolbwN8XsWbNTRpoIMA">Tilly Lockey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had to be amputated of both hands, which were necrotizing due to meningococcal septicaemia, so it wouldn't spread to the rest of her body. She went on to demonstrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimb">prosthetics</a> made by Open Bionics.
