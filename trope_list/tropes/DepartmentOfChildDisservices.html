</p><p>On the occasions when Child Services <em>does</em> exist, they are almost inevitably shown to be one of two brands of stupid, if not both:
</p><p></p><ol><li>Genuinely caring parents and would-be parents will find it nearly impossible to adopt thanks to Child Services' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">strangling bureaucracy</a> and ridiculously judgemental policies. Social workers will never care if something is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a>; anything that could possibly be construed as contributing to a less than perfectly ideal home life is grounds for rejection, regardless of context. Or worse...
</li><li>Child Services is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessDeputy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessDeputy">completely incompetent</a> at actually keeping children out of neglectful or abusive foster homes. No matter how horrific the foster home or adoptive family, once children are placed there, they're on their own. Whether Social Services just stops caring or it's only <em>now</em> that there's any paperwork or red tape involved.
</li><li>Alternatively, Child Services may appear to have more power than the Repo guys, taking children away on a whim - a messy bedroom, missing homework, a scraped knee or just being tired in class is enough to snatch a child from a loving and usually safe parental household. In its strongest examples, a mother might go out for fifteen minutes to get some shopping and return to find their kids gone.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There are other complete fallacies too, like...
</p><ul><li> Taking away only one child.
</li><li> Putting them right into a volunteering friend's house, without first checking to see if the new house is safe.
</li><li> Putting them in a new house right next door, making it easy for the abusive parents to keep tabs on them and possibly kidnap them back.
</li><li> Granting instant visitation rights, regardless of the facts.
</li><li> Returning the kids as quickly as they were taken, without any apparent forethought or investigation.
</li><li> Failing to ask the kids for their personal opinions on things, or asking them "Have your parents abused you?" while the parents are right there in the same room, glaring at the kid and implicitly threatening them to keep quiet.
</li></ul><p>Occasionally, there are the cases in which whatever department is handling Child Services turns out to be actively sinister rather than simply destructively incompetent and/or bureaucratic. Often this is formulated as a political cautionary tale. Depending on the outlet Child Services may be portrayed as heavily biased against devoutly religious, non-traditional families, single parents, or non-custodial parents. Sometimes a perfectly good parent has their children taken away for extremely stupid reasons and has a horrific time trying to get the kids back.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This is a common in-universe trope in many works of fiction as well. Characters may stay in abusive situations and even avoid or refuse to cooperate with Child Services because they have heard horror stories about the results of such intervention, regardless of how positively or negatively Child Services is actually portrayed in-universe (a good way to make use of the trope without passing judgment on the department itself). Abusive parents may actively promote the idea that Child Services is a horrible system, in order to discourage their children from reporting the abuse.
</p><p>Given the derogatory implications it foists upon social organizations, you could say that this trope is firmly on the cynical end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>. On the other hand, the crusading parents or child advocates fighting the system might indeed be portrayed as idealistic.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the wisdom and effectiveness of Child Services varies wildly depending on time and place. Some agencies may be too quick to intervene, or too slow. Some agencies are burdened with endless red tape, and some are quite efficient. Some agencies do a thorough job of investigating claims of abuse and vetting potential new homes for abused children, and some agencies do a slapdash job. The amount of money, authority, willpower, and compassion displayed by each agency (and each individual worker) varies from place to place.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, it's quite rare for a Child Services agency to take children away from their parents permanently. Whether that's because the agency simply lacks the manpower/resources/authority/compassion to properly rescue all abused children, or whether it's because there are actually very few children who would truly benefit from a permanent separation, is a topic of heated debate.
</p><p>Incidentally, not everyone who works at a Child Services agency is technically a "Social Worker". But fictional works rarely bother with the details.

Social services never help because Satoko once made a call to them that she unfortunately ended up unable to support at the time. In the author's afterward for the arc in the VN, he even apologizes about his portrayal of social services, possibly to avoid breaking the aesop stated in the previous afterward for Tsumihoroboshi arc that you always need to ask for help rather than resorting to drastic measures.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade">Witchblade</a></em> anime ultimately springs from meddling of aggressive 'Child Welfare Agency', which starts as a bunch of obnoxious bureaucrats and turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">corrupted and infiltrated by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> biotechnological <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a></span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em>, the Social Welfare Agency is directly responsible for brainwashing little girls into cyborg assassins, a process that guarantees their early deaths. Then again, considering what most of the girls experienced before entering the program, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">it is arguably still an improvement</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> episode "Plight of the Children". While the social workers do get too heavy-handed in their attempts to bring in the orphans, at least some of them genuinely want to help them. The oldest orphan and leader of the group Pigero eventually realizes this and allows the younger orphans to be taken away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em> reveals that children orphaned by Ghoul attacks are taken in by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">CCG</a> and sent to their Junior Academy. While their physical and educational needs are met, the organization makes no effort to find these children new families or even give them normal lives — instead, the Junior Academy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> factory where orphans are given preliminary training as Ghoul Investigators. Juuzou's back story also shows there is little focus on the psychological welfare of the children since the organization <em>wants</em> them to be fueled by their trauma and hatred of Ghouls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em>: Any girl found 'guilty' of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> is kidnapped from their home by the police and sent to a penal colony, considered a mercy compared to being <em>publicly executed</em>. In truth, these girls are raised as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> to fight an army of alien dragons from an alternate universe. It's as ridiculously fatal as it sounds. Not helping matters is how magic and propaganda thoroughly corrupts their former parents and friends into believing they are monsters.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> In at least one version of the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> wound up spending three weeks in juvie after his parents' death because of an incompetent Social Worker.
</li><li> In another, a social worker tries to have a Robin (presumably Dick but possibly Jason Todd) taken away from Batman (not Bruce Wayne, <em>Batman</em>) for child endangerment and the fact that he couldn't prove he had custody of the kid (both having secret identities). Batman, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Batman</a>, actually has papers that state "Robin" is emancipated, which he calmly produces and the woman leaves. Which brings up a whole other host of questions as to how he got those for a masked vigilante kid...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">The Man Without Fear</a></em> has a CPS social worker who grows so disillusioned with her own department's apparent inability to protect young abuse victims that she takes to murdering abusive parents herself.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> story, social services are portrayed as utterly horrible for putting a young girl in "the system", rather than letting her stay with either the split-personality supervillain father who killed her mom or the grandmother who allowed said supervillain father to kidnap her.
</li><li> Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> went through this. After numerous supervillain attacks on the Baxter Building, Child Protective Services accused Reed and Sue of being bad parents towards Franklin and Valeria. After much protest, they agreed to relinquish custody of their children; however, less than four hours after the officials publically announced they were moving the two children to a safehouse, the safehouse was attacked by an unknown enemy and it - along with everything in a half-mile radius - was reduced to a smoldering crater. Fortunately, Reed had thought ahead of time - it had been a "dummy" safehouse, a condition he insisted on before he agreed to the terms, and miraculously, there were no casualties. Humiliated, the officials rescinded their decision. Still, no-one ever found out just who had attacked the decoy safehouse, and it was hinted that <em>maybe</em> the Fantastic Four did it themselves as a ploy to get their children back. But even if that's true, the point still stands: If you think you know better than Reed does, he's going to prove you wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>:
<ul><li> After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone's parents die</span> the kids are put in the system. Karolina's foster family was implied to be drug addicts and too out of it to notice her gone, Nico ended up a group home that as she put was for "unwanted goth children", Chase was able to claim he was living with a relative that didn't exist by using a PO box he had previously set up to pick his <em>Playboy</em> subscription, and they took away Gert's dinosaur (although to be fair, from an outsider's perspective that one would have been a good call). The only one that ended up in a good place was Molly, who was with other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">mutants</a>, but even then she was unhappy because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontSplitUsUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontSplitUsUp">they took her friends away</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">that she considered to be like family</a>.

</li><li> A lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfics explore why Harry was not removed from the abusive aunt and uncle, explaining it using this trope. In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5165369/1/My-Nephew-Harry">My Nephew Harry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the reason was because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">poor communication</a>, excessive paperwork, and confusion over tough love versus abuse. But when Dumbledore does find out, he is not pleased, and Harry is put into the custody of Aunt Marge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> explains the common question in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fic of why social services never got involved. Part of it is implied to be that Little Whinging is a realistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia">Stepford Suburbia</a> and no one talks about That Sort Of Thing, but the key part - which also explains why Mrs Figg never tipped off Dumbledore to the scale of what was going on - is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sinister</span> was involved and wanted Harry to remain in the custody of Dursleys so he could have unfettered access to him in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">the guise of the kindly family doctor</a>, Nathan Milbury, studying the development of his various powers and abilities. Since he was a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepath</a>, it was relatively child's play.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CellarSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CellarSecrets">Cellar Secrets</a></em>, this comes up in Chapter 14, when someone, upset that Ryuuko got into her plants (she's never seen flowers before), calls in a tip to CPS, to which they send someone to investigate. However, as Aikurou and Tsumugu (a lawyer) point out, regardless if there was no evidence of abuse and neglect, they could very well want to take Ryuuko away, based on the fact that she is considered a very impaired child and that Satsuki may not be considered a good enough guardian for her based on the fact (the inverse of the "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever" scenario). When a social worker does come in, she plays this to a degree, as she does things a social worker <em>really</em> isn't supposed to do, as she forces her way in and tries to interrogate Ryuuko without having a warrant or court order to so. Fortunately, due to the case being mishandled, it was dropped and Satsuki retains custody of Ryuuko.
<ul><li> Arguably, one could say they are in full swing of this trope as how they manage or consider to not investigate Ragyo after Ryuuko's existence and her condition was brought to light is a mystery, as having a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> severely abused child with little to no legal documentation kept in a cellar and underwent <em>severe</em> abuse and neglect</span> should have warranted their attention then.
</li><li> Averted, in Chapter 33, where the social worker, being reasonable and competent, just talks to Satsuki and suggests taking measures to make sure that what happened in Chapter 32 doesn't repeat. To especially emphasize this, Ryuuko doesn't treat the social worker with hostility like she did with the previous one.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/82162">Stars from Home<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Xavier and Ruth have a hard time becoming foster parents and later adopting, falling into Type 2. Ororo is in a Catholic orphanage and they use telepathic influence to avoid issues raised by their being unmarried and not Catholic. (Although she's unhappy, the care she receives is basically competent.) Scott spent most of his life facing Type 1; when Xavier tries to adopt him, as a disabled single man, he's considered an unfit parent. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's perhaps <em>even worse</em> that he's able to adopt Scott through bribery.</span>

While Lincoln, here an orphan unrelated to the Louds, was well-treated by his Child Services agent, who is decently competent and admits his mistakes and even took him into his home and got Charles to act as a therapy dog for the traumatized boy, he was also put into a house with 10 boys based on the "One of the Boys" versions of the gender-flipped Loud sisters who are not only as rough as the Loud boys from the episode but outright abusive; Lincoln specifically mentions getting his shoulder dislocated for Loki's cell phone being broken (which was Loni's fault in the first place), which was traumatizing enough that having Bobby, who's Loki's age, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateGestureToTheHead">ruffle his hair</a> is flinch-worthy, and the events of "No Such Luck" coming to pass only with the whole "he's bad luck so let's kick him out of the house" plot (which probably would have <em>improved</em> Lincoln's situation here) being replaced with Lyle, Lynn's counterpart, choosing to <em>beat Lincoln to a pulp with a hockey stick while one of the other boys holds the kid down</em> for his loss, which again was traumatizing enough that Lynn holding a hockey stick proves a trauma button. Lincoln ultimately runs away from that home when some of his foster brothers decide to abuse Charles.

Convict Shadow Robotnik was taken away from his eccentric father-creator Gerald, but Social Services itself accidentally knocked down his sister Maria while doing so, fueling a life-long resentment towards The Man. He was then passed around a series of foster homes which had trouble coping with him due to his emotional trauma and the fact that he's the Ultimate Lifeform. He was finally passed into the care of foster parents who physically and sexually abused him, and who he eventually murdered. Different from many other abuse fanfics in that Shadow clearly avoids bringing it up and will try to change the subject if it does.

Cobra Bubbles initially seems unreasonable and scary with his ultimatum that Nani get a new job within three days, but he makes it clear that he's been called in as a last-resort effort to salvage Lilo's problematic case. While he acknowledges that Nani loves Lilo and is certainly trying to be a good guardian, from his point of view it's clear that she has no control over her overactive little sister, and the danger their new "dog" represents to them and everyone else only makes matters worse. Overall, Mr. Bubbles is a good effort at portraying Social Services as an antagonist while still remaining sympathetic and understandable: as he points out to Nani, as much as she and Lilo love each other, Lilo needs a safer and more stable environment than Nani is able to provide, especially if Nani doesn't have a source of income. Nani also mentions other social workers being by, suggesting that her and Lilo's situation had been under observation for some time before Cobra Bubbles showed up, subverting the whole "one bad day is enough to lose the child" issue. And when aliens intervene to ensure that Lilo, Nani, and Stitch stay together, he's completely reasonable and promises to figure something out. Since the issues ultimately come down to time and money, it should be easy for a government official with a logically unlimited budget to fix everything.

Given all that, getting taken away by social services would have been a blessing, magic protection or not.

He notes that while there is a system in place to support children without families or suffering from abuse, it isn't perfect, and children can end up in poor homes as often as they end up in loving and caring homes. Unlike most portrayals, Harry doesn't seem to hate or disparage the child services system but notes that it has its flaws. It's also probably not their fault that young Harry was put in the care of someone like Justin DuMorne, who was raising/training Harry to be a cross between an acolyte and a hired goon. Justin was a wizard, and one who didn't care about breaking the Laws of Magic, so child services would have been putty in his hands.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a> series: Child Services in this series is <em>so</em> Type 1, as <em>Memory in Death</em> demonstrated. Eve Dallas and at least 10 other girls have been placed in the home of an abusive foster mother named Trudy Lombard over a number of years. Every single one of them ended up running away or being placed somewhere else. The story tries to explain that Lombard knew how to play the system and make it so that no one would believe the girls if they said that she was mistreating them. Unfortunately, that begs the question of how Child Services failed to notice the pattern that every child they put in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Manipulative Bitch</a>'s house resulted in them being worse off than they were before.

</li><li> Used in a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquelineWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquelineWilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a> books. In <em>Dustbin Baby</em>, social services place April in a series of increasingly awful care homes for children: one where the staff doesn't notice that she's being viciously bullied by another girl, one where kids are openly committing crimes (leading to April being caught up in a burglary), and finally a home where most of the girls are serious offenders. In <em>The Bed and Breakfast Star</em> Elsa's family lose their home and are placed in an overcrowded, filthy "bed and breakfast" (cheap motel-style accommodation) despite the fact they have three young children, two of whom are under five. Another family in the bed and breakfast has a son whose asthma is badly affected by the damp, yet the authorities refuse to re-house them. Tracy's care home in the <em>Tracy Beaker</em> series is known as "The Dumping Ground" because it's where children end up when no one wants them. The staff isn't really cruel or abusive, but severely lack funding and resources, and usually fail to notice when the children are having problems.

All of which were at best forgettable, and at worst downright horrible. In one of them, the foster parents even made the children under their care fight each other for a Mcdonalds milkshake. He also remarks how the majority of the children put in foster care end up in prison or worse later in life, and that he himself is one of the few exceptions to this rule. The trope is slightly subverted as well since Norcross admits there are good foster homes, even more now than back in his own childhood; he just never landed in any.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeroesSaveTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeroesSaveTheWorld">Heroes Save the World</a></em>: Hannah Johnson thinks that Child Protective Services is this because they separated her from her other siblings when they were moved into the foster care system. However, it's common practice to separate siblings from each other when one has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToParent">Promoted to Parent</a> for so long that they wouldn't accept an actual adult's authority and might undermine it for the other children.
</li><li> While social services may as well had been nonexistent for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amoridere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amoridere">Toki</a>, they were not for <a class="urllink" href="http://akaichounokoe.deviantart.com/art/Time-Heals-No-Wounds-I-300833450">Jaynine and Sunflower<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as they let her become their foster guardian, nevermind the fact that she has a mental illness, a criminal record, and a long history of violence (things that would normally keep one from being a foster guardian). However, in later stories, we have this with Beryl, whose prior foster parents ran a meth lab (one of the reasons as to why she ran away) and, the story after that, plays with this more, as Nine had gone through so many foster homes that placing her with Toki came a last resort (no other homes would take her).
<ul><li> We have this as well in <em>Toki, Jinx, and Spin in the Bronx</em>, as, ordinarily, social services would have become suspicious of the titular trio living with, in a sense, complete strangers and being enrolled school by said strangers.
</li><li> According to several stories with Toki in them, there tend to be orphaned children roaming the streets and Toki does take them in (and has, on a few occasions, enrolled them into school), social services not intervening then, in which case, this might be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">Social Services Does Not Exist</a> or some kids "fell through the cracks".
</li><li> Averted for the most part with Doki, as we learn in <em>Doki's Chronicles</em>, where social services did work with Cornelius and Euphemia to let them have custody of her, said arrangement going well (besides the 6 mean foster sisters).

</li><li> Invoked by Gail Platt when she was trying to force Sarah to move back in with her. Bethany got into an accident with unknown faulty wiring in their flat but was otherwise unharmed - so Gail phoned social services in an attempt to get Sarah checked out. The social worker however found nothing wrong and even when she returned (only after Gail lied to say that Sarah was regularly leaving Bethany alone in the flat), declared Sarah a capable mother.
</li></ul></li><li> A go-to trope when the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> franchise (<strong>especially</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>) needs a non-criminal / non-FBI whipping boy.
<ul><li> Justified in the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> episode "Indifference," when the detectives berate Child Services for not helping a young abused girl. The bureaucrat, annoyed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">turns on a computer which displays a list of children in need in New York City alone which seems literally a mile long and notes that the state registry is ''even longer'', punctuated with "We have our hands full."</a> The embarrassed detectives leave, having gotten the point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> has multiple variations. Some are just lazy or power-hungry, while others are more along the lines of what was shown in the original: well-intentioned but massively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of cases (however, they probably avert the trope at least as often as it's played straight, especially if child services isn't the focus of the plot; social workers whose role is peripheral are usually portrayed as competent and caring).
<ul><li> An episode ("Careless") has a Child Services worker who, after a distinguished career helping children reach good homes, is hounded to suicide after mistakenly trusting a child to a poor home, resulting in the child's death. The tragedy is, by all accounts, she was generally a good social worker, but she made one mistake that turned out to have horrific consequences (this in spite of her explanation that, at the time, she'd been removing <em>another</em> child from a home where the child's father had beaten his mother to death with a hammer, and thus was distracted to put it mildly).
</li><li> But subverted in the episode ("Home") with a mentally abusive mother who pushed this trope so hard, her older son <em>killed the younger</em> to "save" him from Child Services when they started to investigate and later revealed he was going to kill himself as well but the gun jammed. It turned out there was an even older son who <em>had</em> been taken away, had ended up with good, caring foster parents, and was reasonably well-adjusted (what few problems he has are from his aforementioned abusive mother), but the mother had lied and told the kids he was raped and killed in foster care to further their fear of the system. When the surviving boy learns that his brother is not only alive but was never raped or abused at all, he finally realizes how messed up his mother's view of the world is.
</li><li> In another episode, a man impersonated a child services worker to kidnap two little girls. Compounding the tragedy is that one of the girls in question was <em>in Child Services' custody</em>, but the foster mother bought the lie, and the caseworker's laziness in not making home visits meant that no one realized there was an inconsistency between the records (that said the girl was in one place) and what the foster mom believed had happened (that a Child Services worker had moved the girl to another placement) until several weeks had passed.
</li><li> In another episode ("Institutional Fail"), a severely neglected little girl dies. It turns out that the family's social worker hadn't been to the home in weeks, but this itself is because of how incredibly overworked he was. It turns out that the real problems in the department go way above this one social worker, who was doing the best he could given the impossible amounts of work he was expected to complete. Learning of this, his superiors falsified records to cover themselves, and they end up being the ones charged.

<ul><li> Invoked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> in one episode, a pure harpy of a woman that wanted her daughter-in-law gone and convinced the family's adopted sons (who came from an Eastern Europe orphanage in a country that had suffered a Ceausescu-style regime of horror) that the family was getting fed up with them and Child Services system would come take them away and send them back to <em>that</em> orphanage unless they did something about it. One of the children killed the daughter-in-law for the sake of protecting his brother, who had been treated horribly back there.
</li><li> In "To The Bone", Chesley Watkins (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>), a longtime foster parent, clearly has some issues and probably should never have been allowed to take in children, but flew under the radar for years because her past history as a case worker exempted her from having to take a psychological evaluation until recently. What's more, the caseworker that Logan and Barek talk to has clearly missed all the red flags (including the fact that she keeps "forgetting" to schedule the evaluation she now needs) and practically thinks Watkins walks on water.

In one arc, when Henry is in hospital, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> takes the letter of the law to ridiculous measures; Betty Johnson is denied custody of Punky because Punky would have to share a room with her best friend Cherry. Betty complains that instead Punky will have to share a room with several strangers. Though in the end said social worker coincides that he's unfit for the job and backs off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLWord">The L Word</a></em> (season 3) features a hellish social worker dead set against allowing Bette to adopt Tina's baby so they can be co-parents.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder">Six Feet Under</a></em> where Keith and David expect that the social workers will be examples of Type 2 of the trope and prevent them from having foster kids on account of their being gay, so they methodically hide all of their gay art and literature before the first home interview. In fact, the first social worker who comes to interview them turns out to be gay himself. Later on, Keith and David are having so much trouble managing their sons that they want to ask the social worker during a home visit about placing the kids with a different family. Instead, the social worker is so harried and overworked that she spends about five seconds determining that the kids aren't obviously covered with bruises, tells David and Keith they're doing a fantastic job, and then runs off to her next case.

Clearly someone in the chain of command thinks she's the best; despite her age and un-retired status she's offered the head of the department again once it's realized that in addition to incompetence, her current boss is likely an embezzler.

Rita panics about the visit of a social worker, so she asks Dexter to wait at the house while she isn't there. When the social worker arrives and Dexter tries to make excuses, she cuts him off by saying that Rita is a great parent and that it's a pleasure to go by a house where someone cares. She mentions the only reason she comes over is that its a routine follow up to domestic violence cases, to make sure there's a stable home environment. Continued in that scene where Dexter talks about how great child services was to him, even though at that moment he doesn't know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that child services had nothing to do with him, and that they did screw up with his brother.

Cuddy panics since she did not have the time to fully tidy up the house. The social worker tells her not to worry since she obviously cares a lot about the child and with her job as a doctor and the administrator of a hospital she is more than able to provide for the child.

Because of this, they resort to hiring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">rather immature</a> man to pretend to be their father; not because they think he can take care of them better than they can take care of themselves, but primarily just so that they can keep on living in their current home rather than whatever Child Services would decide for them.

</li><li> In the episode "Children of the Dark" where two foster brothers who were abused in their foster home are now serial killers, the team goes to investigate the family only to find that not only do they still have foster kids, but they still abuse them. This is incredibly obvious the first time they arrive, and one of the killers recalls his foster mother holding him underwater until he passed out, but Social Services says they'll have to run a full investigation first and the kids are returned home <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (one of them with a gun)</span>. This is especially jarring because forensic psychologists (i.e. most of the main cast) often check homes for abuse. So Morgan having shown up and looked around was pretty much what their investigation would <em>be</em>.

Despite there being absolutely <em>zero</em> signs of abuse or neglect, the social worker (who is clearly compensating for having failed to remove a child from a genuinely abusive situation) takes their children away from them, thanks to the woman also managing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">gaslight</a> the townspeople into believing her and testifying against them.

When she finally shows up, Hunter opens the door dressed only in his underwear (which is something they have told him to stop doing because of that very reason) and Michael and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">mom</a> are having the screaming match of the century. They are horrified, convinced that she's going to take Hunter away from them, but she comes back later and tells them they have nothing to worry about since she realizes that a family that love each other enough to feel comfortable yelling like that is not necessarily an unhealthy environment for a child, and she compares them to her relationship with her own mother.

Homer and Marge take the day to go to a spa, leaving Grampa to take care of the kids.

So they snatch the kids away without asking another question when in real life they only have the authority to do this in the most severe of cases and need at the least a warrant to take the children. To Bart and Lisa's utter horror, their foster parents end up being Ned and Maude Flanders. The Flanders are naturally very loving, caring and competent if rather repressing parents so that choice at least makes good sense — except their house is <em>right next door</em> to the couple they claimed were criminally abusive and used nothing more than police tape to separate the two houses.

<ul><li> There was an episode devoted almost entirely to this where Meg took a part-time job and milked her customers' sympathy to get bigger tips by claiming to be the unwed mother of a crack baby (with Stewie playing the part of her "son"). One of said customers was a Social Services agent, and interestingly enough, said social worker actually conducted an investigation (interviewing neighbors, who gave horrible testimony because of an unrelated feud), though she removed Stewie and had Peter and Lois' parental rights terminated without any actual evidence, or for that matter <em>knowing who his actual mother was</em>. Additionally, they take only Stewie away, while if they believed Lois was abusive they should have taken all three children. Worth pointing out, though, the foster family Stewie is put with isn't bad <em>per se</em>, just annoying as all get-out by virtue of being such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Liberals</a> that they've adopted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveTokenBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveTokenBand">one child of each major ethnicity</a>. Stewie then manipulates the other children into fighting each other using ethnic stereotypes. This episode is also the source of the image and page quote, as seen when Peter and Lois go to the Child Services office to try and get Stewie back.

The social worker who shows up in response does nothing to investigate the actual conditions at Starlight House or the details of why the girls ran away (one, Dierdre, ran away in a fit of adolescent pique after both Jerrica and Jem were too busy to talk to her; younger, more impressionable Ba Nee decided to tag along, and the more sensible Chrissie went with them to try to keep them out of trouble) he merely confirms that the girls are missing and declares that if they're not back by the end of the week, he'll recommend that all the Starlight girls be placed in new foster care and Starlight House be shut down.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> episode "Date with Destiny", Goofy's parenting is initially monitored because Max falls asleep in class for one day, turns in a report that was "not up to [his] usual level", and, due to exhaustion, has packed a bad lunch. He is then immediately taken away when his house is shown to be in disarray, even though that isn't even Goofy's fault. Then they move him in with Peg and Pete instantly just because Peg volunteers. While removing Max while Goofy fixes the house might be applicable, they are just as quick to move Max back in when Goofy's house is in an even worse state. And then Miss Pennypacker displays complete and utter unprofessionalism by asking Goofy out to dinner. All this despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">the sorts of things Pete routinely gets away with doing to PJ</a>, though not specifically in this episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> zig-zags this trope in one episode. The foster home Dan visits do a thorough background check on him and seem to actually put some effort into placing children. But when Dan complains about the wait, the social worker takes him to a back room where all the "problem cases" are in cage-like cribs. And they actually let him consider adopting one of them even though his background check hadn't finished yet. There's also the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Hippies</a> for Dan to compete against.
