</p><p>Sometimes the objective of a game (or the player) is to do well — but not perfectly. This annoys people who absolutely <em>must</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">get a perfect score</a> every time. Oftentimes, the buffer zone of "good enough" is unforgivably tiny, and in some cases may be explicitly defined as <em>exactly</em> enough to qualify and nothing higher. Crazy as it seems, getting an imperfect score <em>deliberately</em> might require some very carefully balanced playing, resulting in the rewards for completing the so-called "easier" objectives being more difficult to obtain than those for perfect completion.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Can also apply to computer players, where the A.I. is purposely programmed to not play perfect so that the player actually has a fair chance to win, but while still providing a challenge. A good example is button mashing, where even the most skilled human button masher can be easily outsped by a computer, or beating the world champion at chess, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">Humans Aren't Perfect</a>. Otherwise, natural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> will take care of that. For more general NPCs, compare to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotInducedStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotInducedStupidity">Plot-Induced Stupidity</a>.

Disguising one's potential and situational advantage is crucial to avoid being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">ganged up on</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">the rest</a> in the early stages, which becomes as crucial as being actually skilled enough to come up on top at the end.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>:
<ul><li> Two Heart Pieces are obtained by wearing a mask that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepDeprivationPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepDeprivationPunishment">forces you to stay awake</a> in order to listen to an old lady's boring stories. There are two stories, and she asks you a question after each one to make sure you were paying attention. In order to get both Heart Pieces, you have to get the first question right and the second one wrong.
</li><li> On a related note, there is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">archery game in Clock Town.</a> For beating the record score, you get a Quiver upgrade, and for getting a perfect score, you get a Piece of Heart. The result of this is, if you get a perfect score your first time, which is quite difficult, you will only get the quiver upgrade. Which means you need to get a perfect score a second time to get the Piece of Heart, without any chance of a consolation prize of 50 Rupees for just beating your best score. It's much easier to just beat the record score by one the first time before actually trying for a perfect score. However, the better example of the trope is what happens on subsequent sets of three days. The record score is reset, so you can beat it again for 50 Rupees, or get a perfect for 200. However, getting one perfect score makes it impossible to get ANY prize from anything less than a perfect score. So to get the easiest profit out of this, the best tactic for making money out of this is to beat your best score by one repeatedly until that becomes genuinely difficult, or you get a perfect score, then reset the clock, rather than trying for the big prize every time.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>, your sword trainer rewards you for hitting him a certain number of times before he hits you thrice. Your most rewarding strategy is to start by hitting him 100 times before throwing in the towel, then 300 times before doing so, and finally 500 times. If you go straight to 300, you'll miss out on 50 rupees; if you go straight to 500, you'll miss another 100 rupees. Although, in the time it takes to safely hit him 300 times, you could easily have earned more than that amount by just cutting grass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>: You have to score less than 4000 points to win the quiver from the Pirate's Hideout minigame. You have to deliberately miss a couple of times, as if you hit everything flawlessly to keep the counter up you will exceed 4000.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>:
<ul><li> Getting over 28 points in the "Clean Cut" minigame will earn you rare treasures like Goddess Plumes and Golden Skulls. However, getting between 20 and 23 points will get you an Evil Crystal, another rare item. Another prize you want occasionally in the same minigame is the 30 Rupees for 15-19 points. Since the game costs 10 Rupees, getting this relatively low score every few times will ensure that you'll never run out of Rupees while playing it.
</li><li> If you survive all 12 rounds of the "Boss Rush" minigame, you get a ludicrous 9,900 Rupees. This seems like a lot, but by the time you have the necessary upgrades to hold that many Rupees, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">there's not much left to buy with them</a>. You can, however, forfeit the game early for different prizes. Quitting after round 8 gives you the Hylian Shield, the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">unbreakable</a> shield in the game. It's very handy for the final battle, which involves a lot of shield-blocking and shield-bashing, and for not needing to worry about your stupid shatter-prone shield in general. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">And it looks cool.</a> Even if you really want that pile of Rupees, it's a good idea to get the shield first: it makes the minigame a lot easier, since you can't use potions to repair your shield if it breaks. There's also the fact that you can only win <em>one</em> prize from the Boss Rush; even if you make it all the way to the final battle in the chain and win, you only get the "beat all the bosses" prize. This means that, in order to win the Hylian Shield and Piece of Heart from the minigame, you have to play and quit the challenge after beating 4 battles (for the Piece of Heart) and 8 battles (for the Hylian Shield).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>: Getting A ranks on most Adventure Mode stages requires a certain number of KOs. Reaching that number may require the player to hold back on capturing keeps until enough enemies have spawned.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em> punishes the player for being a bit too clever or a very good fighter in some branches. If Indy surrenders the fake diary or is able to escape the Castle with Henry undetected (doable when all the guards are knocked out), they will miss Berlin completely and with it not only puzzles, game content and cutscenes, but also the chance of getting an easy bypass of the roadblocks from none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SawIIFleshAndBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SawIIFleshAndBlood">Saw II: Flesh &amp; Blood</a></em>, getting the best ending requires you to complete all of Campbell's trials but then deliberately <em>lose</em> the last one. If you win it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you (unknowingly) defeat Michael; and when you get to the end of the game, playing as Michael, you experience the defeat from the other end.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWhiteChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWhiteChamber">the white chamber</a></em>, the key to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a> is to identify good moral decisions that Sarah can make. If you make enough of them, Sarah will be deemed to have redeemed herself and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arthur will set her free</span>. But, if you make <em>all</em> the correct decisions, you instead get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> "Comedy" ending which provides no closure to the story. Fortunately, the developers included a way for Sarah to <em>subtract</em> a good deed, meaning it's not necessary to replay the entire game if you found all of them.

<ul><li> One strategy for getting through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand">God Hand</a></em> is to deliberately manipulate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">Dynamic Difficulty</a> by letting yourself take hits now and then.

To get it, you have to take the lead within the last ten seconds of a multiplayer match and keep it by the end of the match. Naturally, the best way to get it would be to stay close enough to the leader that you can easily overtake, but not actually take the lead until the time is right.
<ul><li> This achievement can easily be "boosted" by cooperating with someone in a private match, but getting it legit, in a dramatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">come-from-behind</a> victory can lead to whoops and cackles of joy.
</li><li> In Revelations, there is an achievement related to the "Base Defence" minigame triggered by being notorious for too long. For some players, getting this achievement requires going on a rampage, or other similar high-profile activities. And even then, you better hope it's early in the game, before you permanently lock the Assassin Dens by installing a master assassin in them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em> has you correctly guess in which order you have to play through the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> to get the good ending. In reality, you're supposed to mess it up on purpose to see every possible outcome and collect every cutscene in the game, which is the only way to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>. So there's no real need for correctly chaining the boss fights, since you'll have to go through every possible combination to get every cutscene, one way or another.

Ways of Life are unlocked by doing certain things to obtain Titles in Empire Mode, then beating the game. The problem is, you're automatically assigned the highest tier Way of Life you qualify for and you can't go backward, which makes it difficult to get some of the low-to-middle tier titles. Do you want your character to be known as an Undefeated Veteran? Fight defensive battles and do escort quests, but you better make sure those quests are all for the same person, because if you manage to get too many people to like you the game will automatically upgrade you to Trustworthy Hero!

In many Fighting Games, there is a Training mode in which you must complete the combos that the computer prompts you with. In many cases an incorrect move in the combo can actually result in it doing more damage, which would make it a superior combo for actual use, but the game will not give you credit for it unless you do exactly the combo you are told to do.

You need to beat Career Mode on/5-Star every song on each difficulty separately to unlock all the guitars. <em>Guitar Hero III</em> made the achievements for beating Career Mode stackable (hard gets you easy and medium) but not the ones for 5-Starring everything. <em>World Tour</em> and later games abandoned this approach.
<ul><li> In the early <em>Guitar Hero</em> games, you couldn't tell what your star rank would be until the end of the song. Fansite <em>ScoreHero</em> compiled a list of cutoffs for the different grades by repeatedly playing through and recording what scores earned how many stars. This got rather difficult when suddenly single-point precision is required.
</li><li> No-fail cheats in later games made it significantly easier. Trying to miss enough to land exactly one point short of the four-star cutoff while still passing the song is hideously counterintuitive; far easier is to set a target score from the start, whammy point the last digits early on, play normally (well, skipping holds) until you hit the score and then ignore everything else.

This is actually harder than playing the game for real, since you have to be just a little off the beat, consistently. It's usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove">In the Groove</a></em> acknowledges Great Attacks.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopNMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopNMusic">pop'n music</a></em> has the "ALL GOOD" norma, which requires you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">get all Goods</a>. It's <em>very</em> difficult to do, so it's no surprise that it's a 15-point norma.
<ul><li> There is also a slightly easier norma which requires you clear a song with a full meter and a maximum of 25,000 (out of 100,000) points. Getting all Goods would get you exactly 20,000 points and a full meter, so even with a full combo you can occasionally get a Great.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the top-tier challenges in the PSX version of <em>DDR 4th Mix</em>'s Challenge Mode was to clear a specific section of a song without a single Perfect or Great. This required Good Attacking the song, as a Boo or Miss would lower your gauge, and you fail if it empties, while the only way to raise it is to get Perfects or Greats. Another challenge required getting all Goods on a (much shorter) section.
<ul><li> <em>DDR Extreme US PS2</em> had you do a section with zero points, basically the same thing (you can't get any Greats or Perfects at all, and any Boos or Misses would drain your health).

<ul><li> Since getting a Good judgment in <em>beatmania IIDX</em> doesn't provide any points, getting all Goods in a song (also known as "Good Attacking") will result in you clearing it with a full combo, but finishing with a score of 0, the same as if you didn't hit any notes at all.
</li><li> <em>beatmania IIDX</em> and at least one version of <em>Beatmania III</em> offer the Border Bonus: Finish the song with your meter filled just barely enough to pass, and you'll get a bonus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoroawaseNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoroawaseNumber">573</a>0 points. There are also higher bonuses if you combine this with getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">all Greats or higher</a>, or all Just Greats.
</li><li> In <em>beatmania IIDX 20 tricoro</em>'s Legend Cross event (until it ended), one of the requirements to unlock boss songs was to finish a song with an EX score of exactly 573.
</li><li> Done again in <em>beatmania IIDX 21 SPADA</em>'s Super Star Mitsusu revival event, where one of the unlock requirements was to play a song on Mirror and finish with an EX Score of exactly 623.
</li></ul></li><li> This is basically the (unimaginative) point of half of the World Max mission mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em>. Quite a few other missions have some incredibly clever gameplay mechanics though, or some alternative stepcharts that are so fun they should probably be illegal.

There's the discs that require you to get at least a certain percentage on a song, but there's also ones that require you to get very low percentages, as well as ones that require you to have exactly a multiple of 10 as your percentage. There's also the Lucky and Evil discs, obtained by getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckySeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckySeven">77.7%</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast">66.6%</a>, respectively.

</li><li> <em>DJMAX Trilogy</em> has the "Self Injury" mission, in which the goal is to complete a set of songs with an accuracy rating between 60% and 70%. Delves a little into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> because hold notes, when held down, yield MAX 100% for every eighth note that it's held down for.
</li><li> <em>DJMAX Technika</em>'s Technical Mode. Each set has two boss songs (or in the case of two sets, three), and which one you get depends on your MAX-to-notecount ratio for the first 3 stages. So you should always try to nail lots of MAXes, right? WRONG. Some of the boss songs you get for getting high MAX percentages actually have a lower max combo than their low-accuracy counterparts, meaning you get more points on the 4th stage if you get the boss song that requires lower accuracy. So what does this lead to? Having to play "Cool Attack" and get some Cools to avoid raising the MAX percentage too high and getting the lower-scoring 4th stage. Perhaps because of this, <em>DJMAX Technika 2</em> and <em>3</em> instead determine boss songs based on which available songs you pick for your set.
<ul><li> The Specialist Set, however, has an intentional example of this. Get less than 70% MAX judgments and you get the set's third possible boss song, Fermion.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteBeatAgents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteBeatAgents">Elite Beat Agents</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OsuTatakaeOuendan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OsuTatakaeOuendan">Ouendan</a></em> games have different cutscenes for failing level segments and the entire level, and most of them are worth seeing. It's not quite as easy as you'd think, though, since you can't clearly see the point where you fail or pass the level segment (making it easy to hit a note at the end of a segment by accident and push the rating bar over to "pass" when you thought not hitting it would cause it to empty completely) and doing poorly will easily cause you to get a game over instead, not to mention that you need to fail every level segment to get the bad ending for the level.
<ul><li> Another version of this trope starts appearing in <em>Elite Beat Agents</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle">Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Tamashii: Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2</a></em>. EBA introduced a vs. Ghost mode, in which you challenge the best saved score you have on a particular song — this manifests as a vs. battle. If you do too well in setting a high score, you will have a lot of trouble beating yourself.
<ul><li> Furthermore, within the battle itself, you can get points by a perfect 300 run on a particular section of the beatmap, and half a point for getting even a single 100. Gain three or four points and you go into a sort of super mode, increasing your performance while decreasing the opponent's. If you do better than your original score in some points, you'll hit this mode one section before your opponent. They then hit the next one, making you lose the cutscene checkpoint.
</li><li> Also, whenever the opponent does that to you, the numbers and trails become smaller and harder to hit. If you want to mitigate this, you'll have to do exactly as well as your opponent until just before the end.

Each Dark Note has three bosses, determined by your performance in two tracks. Pass a certain point in the Field Music Stage, and you will fight Boss No. 2 or 3, but not No. 1; so if Boss No. 1 has an item you want, then you need to use someone with shoddy Agility. If you have above half of your maximum HP after defeating two enemies in the Battle Music Stage, you will fight Boss No. 3, so if Boss No. 2 has something you want, put the White Magic away and take a few hits.
<ul><li> The first game also has critical charts for Field and Battle Music Stages: they branch out generally near the middle into a Feature Zone, the completion of which either summons a Chocobo that the character rides on in the FMS or a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a> attack in the BMS that often defeats the current enemy on its own. However, in order to fill the said critical charts completely (ie. hit every note perfectly at least once during cumulative playthroughs of the song), you need to fill the segment following the Feature Zone during the said feature as well as outside of it, the latter of which meaning that you either need to play the song in Stoic Mode which disables the Feature Zone and which is accomplished by unequiping all skills from your party as well as your current consumable item, or just miss enough notes during the Feature Zone so that it won't activate. This is thankfully removed in the sequel, where the critical charts have no branching paths and Stoic Mode only exists as a minor Rhytmia bonus instead of being needed for maximum scores.

This is easy enough in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels">amateur mode</a>, where x4 is the highest multiplier, but pro mode adds the x5 and x10 multipliers. Do too well in pro mode and you'll run right past the boss, but don't do well enough and you'll never reach him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuseDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuseDash">Muse Dash</a></em>, some chart-specific missions require you to get hurt a set number of times (dodging an enemy doesn't count, you have to run into it) and still clear the chart.

After your first successful completion of the track with a better time than the current record another racer will then perform slightly better than your time, requiring you to run the track again and beat your own best time by a fair margin. Granted, you are warned there will be other players, but not that one of them will <em>always</em> be better than your first run. Unless, of course, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">know in advance</a>.

Score at least 20 points and you'll win a flower tab. However, the next time you play, you MUST score at least two extra points higher than your previous attempt in order to win again. If you scored more then twenty, this is still the case, and you'll have to score two more points the next time you play, so the best strategy is to stop and stand still once you've reached 20 points, beating your score little by little each time to continue earning victories.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em>, the Grunty races award prizes for beating the 1st, 2nd or 3rd place times, and you can race them over and over again to win more; however, your race times become the new record times to beat. If you want to maximize the payout, then you want to just barely beat the current times (starting with 3rd place and working up) so that the new times are not too hard to beat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameRemake">or at least the PSP version</a>), this trope is in full effect when leveling characters. Due to the...unique nature of the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatGrinding">Stat Grinding</a> system, the odds of getting a stat boost after any one battle is directly proportional to the <em>length</em> of the battle. The idea, one suspects, is to prevent players from grinding low-level monsters indefinitely, but the end result is being punished for fighting battles as efficiently as possible, whereas if you artificially prolong the fight (a common strategy is to put enemies to sleep to prevent them from running away, then abusing fellow party members), the odds of getting a stat boost increase almost to the point of guarantee. This can be maddening to a certain kind of gamer... which is to say a <em>sapient</em> one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is a mini-game where you have to prevent soldiers from reaching a fort. Failing to do this causes a fight against the boss with the regular characters. Normally, you get the proper reward only if you complete the mini-game, and you lose it if you have to fight the boss, win or lose. However, the one time this mini-game is plot-mandated, the normal reward is given if you complete the mini-game <em>or</em> beat the boss. And as it turns out, you can get a rare and powerful piece of armor by defeating the boss at this point (and never before this point), and the boss is pretty easy. A savvy character will lose the mini-game on purpose the final time, since there's no benefit in winning.
</li><li> Junon has two instances.
<ul><li> First, the parade. The gist of this is that you want to try to march out and fall in line while troops march past. The better you do, the higher the ratings. The higher the ratings, the better the reward. However, the "best" reward is simply 5,000 gil. The next best is 6 ethers. Ethers can be sold for 750 gil each, meaning if one sold all 6 of them, they would get 4500 gil, 500 gil shy of best reward. The catch is that ethers cost 1500 gil to buy and most players are going to end up needing to buy that many at some point anyway.
</li><li> The "posing" minigame during Rufus' sendoff is also noteworthy. The second-best prize (60-90 points) is an HP Plus Materia (boosts max HP by 10% per level), while the "top" prize is a weapon for Cloud that you'll be able to buy in the very next town. HP Plus Materia, meanwhile, is not only generally more useful, but also doesn't appear in shops for a fair while after this, and is much more expensive.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the entire endgame, where the first boss battle determines how the next two play out: Depending on how quickly the player beats the first boss, what levels the player's characters have and how many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalPartyMember">Optional Party Members</a> the player has found, the second battle will have the player split into one to three teams, with the main team continuing into the final boss battle solo. Both the final and penultimate bosses also gain HP boosts for every character in the game with maximum levels, and if the player uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic">Knights of the Round</a> on the first boss.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>'s first task is to defeat Ifrit within a selected-by-you time limit. The catch is that the test is described as a "test of judgment", so completing it too soon means you could not accurately estimate your abilities and subsequently gave yourself too much time. In other words, scoring well on this test requires finishing with <em>less</em> time remaining — a perfect score is reached if you finish with ten seconds or less remaining on the clock. <br/><br/>In the Japanese version, you have to kill Ifrit and <em>escape the dungeon</em> before you run out of time, making the whole experience more of a test of time management rather than rationality (plus it serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> for something you'll be doing later in the story). <br/><br/>Even if you give yourself the lowest amount of time possible, your score will still drop if you kill Ifrit too soon. The best score requires you to finish with <em>seven seconds</em> or less on the clock, which means most people will end up letting Ifrit beat on them for a while (you can <em>still</em> get a game over if he's talking when the timer runs out, though). <br/><br/>However, you can cheat the system in the English version and avoid this trouble by taking note of how much time you have remaining when you defeat Ifrit. Then, when the naming screen comes up, stay on that screen and keep an eye on your watch until time's up, then continue gameplay as normal. There, now you have the best possible score, a giant hellbeast at your beck and call, and a smug sense of superiority.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>: In "The Festival of the Hunt" minigame, the goal is to earn the most points of all the competitors by killing monsters in the streets. If you (playing as Zidane) win, you get 5000 gil. If Vivi wins, you get a useless Tetra Master card. Letting Freya win, however, nets you a decent elemental-absorbing accessory that teaches your characters a few useful skills. To let her win, just put the controller down for 12 minutes or kill yourself in the first battle you come across. <br/><br/>That said, the toughest monster in the Festival of the Hunt, the Zaghnol, has two items worth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing">stealing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">gives about enough points to single-handedly win the competition</a>. By avoiding lesser battles, entering a certain area with 4:30 left on the timer, and making Zidane take a fall against the Zaghnol (or teaming up with Freya, which splits the points between them), the player can get all of the items.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>'s entire experience system revolved around this. If you use the right character and end a battle in one turn, you'd get 1/7 the maximum amount of AP, as only characters who act in battle get any AP at all, and it's not split or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">leaked</a> in any way. Conversely, if you waste six turns (using a different character each time) and use the seventh to end the battle, then every character gets full experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The best culprit to pin during the Mi'ihen Mystery is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rikku</span> if you're aiming for 100% completion. One of the criteria for catching this person requires a certain cutscene that can only be seen if you <em>almost</em> catch the Chocobo during Chapter 2. If you catch it or let it get away without resistance, it becomes far more difficult (if not impossible) to accuse that person.
</li><li> Later, during the massage minigame, you obtain a prize of a Gold Hairpin if you succeed on the first attempt. If you fail at least once, though, you obtain Heady Perfume, which is arguably a more useful accessory.
</li><li> The first time you play the "Gunner's Gauntlet" minigame/mission, completion of the timed course and a score of 500 are necessary to pass the mission. It can be replayed to achieve a higher score and additional prizes. On a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, however, when you get to this mission again, the required score is now your high score from your previous playthrough[s].
</li><li> Your characters earn 1 AP per battle, and an extra AP for every successful non-Attack action during the battle. You can quickly end battles for EXP and Gil by selecting the Attack command, or you can draw them out to master dresssphere abilities faster by using supplementary skills or items.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, this is part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Warrior of Light</a> is a servant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Hydaelyn</a> and fights to prevent terrible calamities. A storyline in the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion, however, reveals that being <em>too</em> good at this results in Light aether growing out of control into a flood of light which annihilates all life in its path. The Warriors of Darkness are heroes from a world where this is in the process of happening, and the theme comes up again in <em>Shadowbringers</em> when the Warrior must become a Warrior of Darkness themselves. By the same token, the Ascians, servants of the dark god <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Zodiark</a>, are trying to bring about the calamities which the Warrior is trying to prevent in order to free Zodiark. There is already an example of a world which fell completely into darkness as a result of them being too successful, creating a realm called "The Void" which their god has no use for.
</li><li> In some bosses on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, if you take down their health too quickly, you can run into problems.
<ul><li> For example, in the Madness of Deathwing encounter, it's possible for the Blistering Tentacles (which come up after you reduce a limb tentacle's health enough), to come up at the same time as the Elementium Bolt or the Regenerative Blood (which come up on a timer) even if the raid has killed the Mutated Corruption already. So if the raid damages the limb too quickly, it'll have to fight the Regenerative Blood at the same time as the Blistering Tentacles and/or the Elementium Bolt, making things very difficult.
</li><li> Additionally, on the Maloriak encounter, while most spells that can be interrupted should be, and in some cases, must be, interrupting all the casts in which he releases aberrations will result in all 18 aberrations coming out at once during Phase 2 along with the Prime Specimens, and since they get a damage buff when close to each other, it's almost impossible to survive.
</li><li> Similarly, while many boss achievements have DPS requirements that are difficult to meet around the time of the related content's release, others can easily be failed by defeating the boss too quickly, typically resulting in raid groups telling players to stop DPS so that the boss won't die before the group meets the achievement requirements.
</li><li> Some quests require using items on mobs near death — usually 20% health or less. This gets annoying when doing old content with a character of much higher level, when the lower-level mobs die from as much as the character sneezing on them, forcing the player to equip a less powerful weapon or even unequip it entirely.
</li><li> It's also possible to run into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">mix of the two:</a> killing an old raid or dungeon boss too quickly could mess with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags">Event Flags</a> of the instance, preventing you from advancing any further. If you're lucky, the boss will respawn some time later, and you'll hopefully be able to DPS it down more slowly this time. If not... well, time to reset the instance (unless, of course, you're in a raid, in which case you'll just have to wait for it to reset on its own the next week) and give it another shot.

Each noise provides a (potentially) different drop for each of four difficulty levels. As drop rates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">aren't always 100%</a>, however, you may miss out on the one for your difficulty level, but should you do so, you'll then get a chance at the next lowest drop, and (should you miss out on that one too) the <em>next</em> lowest drop, until either you get a drop, or miss out on the lowest drop. Despite this, it's still possible to lock out lower drops at higher difficulty levels by raising your drop rate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">too high</a>, especially since it's possible to miss unlocking Easy.

<ul><li> <em>Battle Network</em> also applies for chips from viruses, as some codes can only be obtained with a low rank, and specific codes are an important part of folder-building. You can also calculatedly take a couple of hits and obliterate the boss/virus otherwise.

<ul><li> In the bug catching contest in the second generation, first prize was a Sun Stone, which only evolved two Pokemon. Second prize was an Everstone, a hold item that kept Pokemon from evolving (which is completely useless since you can just cancel the evolutions manually anyway). Third prize was a Gold Berry, a hold item that restored 30 HP and was incredibly rare. Once you got two Sun Stones, Gold Berries were what you wanted to win.
</li><li> The Platinum version contains a special challenge that requires you to defeat a series of trainers in a certain amount of turns. However, as you are required to match the number of turns exactly, doing too well against them will result in a failure.

</li><li> Inverse Battles handled by Inver also work this way, with the reward quality increasing with the number of super effective attacks you land.

Damage from maxed out player averages around 500 damage and if you're not at least occasionally dealing over 100 damage a hit, you have no business fighting phases. Thankfully, this was mitigated during the Hero's Quest updates, which added a "Hold Back" option that cancelled all damage bonuses you had for that attack (because you had to perform an action similar to "Shoot the Core" in order to retrieve plot-critical character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mimi</span>).

If you beat him to any degree, you're told that you tried too hard and need to chill. If you lose too badly, you're told that you suck and need to try again. If you intentionally let him win by the slightest possible amount, you're told it was "an epic battle" or some similar expression and move on to the next challenge you're supposed to barely lose. The robot is also <em>incredibly</em> slow to complete each contest, just to rub in how ludicrous it is.

Do it correctly, and you receive a useful item and some icons. Miss it by mere <em>milliseconds,</em> however, and you can net other useful items. The most notable is probably what happens if you end up pressing the button at <em>exactly</em> 9.9 seconds, in which case, you can obtain the super-rare Mysterious Egg fossils.
</li><li> The mobile phone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> game <em>One Piece Treasure Cruise</em> has a Timed Hit system where tapping on the next character to attack at the right time will chain for more damage. Normally, you <em>do</em> want perfect, but the exception comes when you need to heal. A character will randomly have meat appear during an attack and, if you chain attacks perfectly, you'll hit so hard the meat flies away and you can't use it. You don't get anything if you miss altogether, either. Instead, you must successfully chain lower than Perfect to heal up.

Fortunately, it's less of a problem in <em>4 Ultimate</em> when you fight the G Rank version, as it starts out the second phase much closer to the Dragonship; while the Dragonship is in greater danger of damage, you're less likely to stagger the monster to the point of carving deprivation, and the Dragonship is surprisingly durable anyway.

Playing perfectly will result in scoring the winning throw yourself, and advancing a party member's Baton Pass level by only one. However, scoring <em>just</em> well enough to allow your teammate to toss the winning throw themselves will instantly increase them up to the third, and max, ranking.

Should you mash too hard, the snail freaks out under the pressure and catches fire. Should you mash at a decent pace and <em>win,</em> you get 9 gold (the game costs 10 gold to enter). However, should you lose by a <em>very</em> thin margin, the snail believes it actually <em>won</em>, and you're given 30 gold to avoid disappointing the snail.
</li><li> There's an achievement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WestOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WestOfLoathing">West of Loathing</a></em> if you finish the prologue with the highest possible amount of money. Most of the money can be found sooner or later by carefully exploring the map. However, the last bit of money is hidden inside a box in a crack in the floor of a mine. You can locate this if you're thorough, but you can't actually reach it. The only way to get this money is by using a stick of dynamite the game unexpectedly gives you out of pity if you lose a fairly easy fight. As a result, someone who's good at the game is unlikely to stumble across the dynamite by chance, so this achievement can actually be harder for them to figure out.
</li><li> <em>Crowntakers</em> has a controversial timed campaign result; to get the good ending, you need to <em>intentionally fail to save the king</em> on time, because he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a> who <em>always</em> arrests you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">for not saving him on day one</a>, but killing the Duke after the king's execution allows you to claim the title of crown prince. You can't just wait it out on the farm, though, because all enemies level up every day. Ideally, you'll want to get through the challenging game at a balanced pace, then wait outside the castle until day 19, when the king is beheaded, and rush in to 'avenge' him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2gjz4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2gjz4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2gjz4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that you get an achievement for saving the king, but it's pyrrhic at best.</span>

<ul><li> A strategy for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> and many other kart racers, while playing with other humans, is to follow fairly closely behind the lead player but not be the lead. This way, you receive better items to attack with and get a last-second victory. This is especially true with <em>Mario Kart DS</em> and <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>, as the infamous Blue Shell is designed to target the racer in 1st place and nobody else, as long as they aren't too close behind. This is less true with games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing">Diddy Kong Racing</a></em>, however, that have highly defensive item systems: Those 2nd or lower need to attack and defend, but the lead racer need only defend.
</li><li> A few instances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a></em> have this. In the first game, if a player is in the Bowser Suit in Bowser's version of the Bash 'n' Cash minigame, it's usually more beneficial to let the other 3 players take one or two coins bags of 5 from you rather than none. Why? Because if you don't lose any coins, then Bowser will take 15 coins from you, just to make you suffer.
<ul><li> In the GBA game <em>Advance</em>, there is Bowser Land that has you riding a Bowser themed roller coaster and trying to get to the end by playing random Bowser minigames. The catch is that if you finish too fast, or don't fail enough minigames, then Bowser won't reward you with as much coins. Fail too many minigames though, and Bowser will also cut your reward for going too slow, or even end your game before you can finish.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Franchise Mode, if your team wins three Super Bowls in a row (unprecedented in reality), your head coach will retire and you'll be forced to promote an assistant coach or hire a free agent, both options likely resulting in a lesser coach in terms of ratings. The only other reason a coach will retire is due to age (with the odds increasing the older he gets and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">RNG roll</a> at the start of the offseason determining it), but a Super Bowl three-peat will ensure this.
</li><li> The in-game officials are programmed to make mistakes on occasion to allow for coach's challenges.
</li><li> In <em>Madden 2004</em>, a single player cannot accumulate more than 1023 rushing yards (more than three times the actual NFL record) in a single game; any more would wrap around to -1024 due to an overflow error. With a good team, a good playbook, and a good working knowledge of AI behavior, the player might need to cut a run short and make a substitution to avoid wrecking his star running back's statistics.
</li></ul></li><li> In sister series <em>NCAA Football</em>, there are often achievements for winning all of the various bowl game trophies. However, many of the bowl games are consolations for the schools who finished #2, #3, or lower in their conferences.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NHL2K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NHL2K">NHL 2 K</a></em> had a persistent issue across all versions that the +/- would wrap at 128. Worse, the chemistry stat for lines would go to pot when this happened as clearly these two defensemen don't play well together when they're sitting at -120.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf">Mario Golf</a></em> N64 had bronze, silver, and gold trophies for finishing tournaments in the appropriate place. Silver and Bronze need to be earned separately from Gold, but they don't do anything anyway.
</li><li> As <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XkKufyIiAY">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows, speedruns of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSportsResort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSportsResort">Wii Sports Resort Golf</a></em> need to complete each hole in as few strokes as possible, but landing a particularly impressive shot like a hole-in-one or a long putt will trigger a replay that wastes time. So speedrunners need to play each hole with shots just good enough for optimal times, but not quite good enough for replays.
</li><li> <em>Sports Jam</em> gives trophies in Original Mode for getting the #1 high score, the #2 high score, and anywhere from the #3 to #10 high score. The tricky part was that it has to be in that place on the high score chart <em>at the time</em>. So the best way to get #2 is to play one really good game, then get a score higher than the default #1, 40,000 (pretty easy) but not quite as great as your best score. Not too hard if you plan for it, but it can get frustrating if you don't.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>, you have the Challenge with Glass Joe that requires to knock him down three times, and let him win by decision, and the Challenge with TD Mr. Sandman that requires you to almost get knocked out, and then return to win. Also, there's the protective headgear unlocked for losing 100 times in Career Mode. It becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a> if you clear all of Career Mode without getting it, since Career Mode goes away upon completion. That's the only mode you can use it in anyway, though, so it's not a big loss.
</li><li> In the (originally) MMO golf game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pangya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pangya">Pangya</a>,</em> Approach Mode is a competition to put your ball as close to the hole as possible - <em>without</em> going in. If your cup winds up in the hole, you come in last.

In order to prolong the game and acquire certain unlockables it is necessary to lose any WWE title matches, and often to throw other matches as well in order to avoid the title shot storylines in favour of the ones with the desired rewards.
<ul><li> The next iteration, WWE 2k16, has a mechanic in career mode that rewards move variation and prolonging matches by means of near-misses, failed pins, reversals, and so on. So ending the match quickly with an efficient-but-repetitive technique will only gain modest rewards, while putting on a good show and building drama will award the player with more virtual currency and prestige. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Well, it IS</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>.

One area is near a team's spawn point, one is near the other team's spawn point, and the third is somewhere between the other two. Because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">a quirk in the game's respawn rules</a>, it's usually more effective to control only two of the areas instead of all three. Besides spreading forces thinner, controlling all three areas makes the losing team respawn anywhere on the map, whereas controlling only two keeps them respawning around the one area they control, making their movements and strategies more predictable.

Normally, this isn't enough on its own, so letting enemies escape and missing powerups are often employed to lower the rank further.
</li><li> A challenge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters">TimeSplitters</a></em> requires you as the Veiled SWAT to keep bank robbers from taking more than four bags of loot to their base in order to play as Veiled SWAT in Arcade Mode. Finish the challenge without the robbers getting away with a single bag though, and a glitch will keep him forever locked, even if you retry and letting the other team score a bag or two.

However, if you want to be able to apply the Flecktarn camo pattern to your weapons, you <em>have</em> to let them get away and rescue the HVI in the Strike Force level. Even though the game gives you the option to play it anyway even if you already rescued the HVI, beating it in that instance doesn't unlock the camo pattern. There are also other incentives to letting DeFalco get away; in particular, he will continue making appearances throughout the campaign (if you kill him, a generic mook with a much less interesting personality will take his place), and there's also an achievement that requires you to let him get away and skip the second chance at a rescue.

Once a city surrenders it will give a monthly income, but you can't smash it up for resources any more.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> Dark Crusade</em>, during the campaign, it's generally not actually a good idea to attempt to rush a single-base enemy and kill them quickly when invading a new area - your bases are persistent, meaning that it's usually smartest to just pin the enemy in place while you claim as much of the map as possible, <em>then</em> go in and crush them. The end result: access to top-tier units from the start of the next battle there, which is a wise course of action since by about midgame your enemies get to start with mid-tier construction buildings like their faction's vehicle facility.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Reigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Reigns">Reigns</a></em>, you have to carefully balance the power of the Church, your People, the Army and your Treasury.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> is a weird example. There are only two endings, and while the "Possessed" ending is bleaker than the normal ending, it isn't considered a "bad" ending, as it's impossible to get on the first playthrough, and many players actually strive to achieve it on their second playthrough, as it's rather difficult. The game has a hidden point system, which goes up every time you kill an enemy or take damage, and in order to get the Possessed ending, you must exceed 4000 points. This means in order to get the (objectively) "good" ending, you need to avoid as many enemies as possible.
</li><li> You could unlock different weapons in Replay Mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2">Parasite Eve 2</a></em> depending on your ending score. Some good items required low scores.
<ul><li> Only the lowest possible rank nets you an arguably better item than the rank above it. However, getting the lowest possible rank is a challenge in and of itself, as you have to flee every battle so as to not rack up points by killing things. Using this method, you not only have to be able to dodge virtually every enemy in the game without getting hit, you're also forced to take on every boss in the game with the weakest weapon.
<ul><li> There is actually a way around that — Beat the game twice in a row with the best possible rating. The game will only ever give you a specific reward one time; if you ever got a repeated "Rank", you would get the reward for the next HIGHER Rank; this carries over. In other words: Getting the best possible Rank twice in a row (assuming you are not playing in a mode that alters the Rankings) will give you the "best Rank" rewards and the "worst Rank" rewards. The latter set borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> territory in some ways.

In order to get the neutral ending, one has to save some innocents, do some good. But not in all situations. It's okay to shoot the guy who keeps firebombing you by accident.
</li><li> This is the AI director's take on the team's progress in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>. Doing too well will make less health and bomb items appear and the director is more likely to spawn a Tank - except when the game just feels like giving you all the special Infected, including the Witch and Tank, with no medkits until the end of the level when your team all has less than 20 health left from the Tank that smashed them earlier, or when the Director decides to spawn three tanks <em>in a row</em> because you've been killing them with impunity the past few games. The Director is a fickle bastard and is wholly impossible to predict.

<ul><li> In several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> games you can earn plenty of money by repeatedly doing a timed race and improving your result a tiny bit every time. When you first do one of these races, the game gives you a set time limit to beat the race, which is usually lenient. You can then repeat the race, this time going against your previous best time, and every time you improve on it, you win money. Thus, if you deliberately dawdle on your first attempt and finish just under the time limit, you can keep winning money from the race over and over by finishing just a second or two faster every time. If you try your best on the first attempt, you lose out on all that cash.

So if you want to get the award for collecting all the achievements, you need to take a break during two scenes and let the game timer run. Some games make it even more frustrating by having one achievement for completing a hidden object scene in under a minute, one for completing X hidden object scenes <em>in a row</em> in under three minutes, and one for completing a hidden object scene in over 10 minutes, making 100% completion easily unreachable by accident.

There's achievements/trophies for losing a million dollars on the Jack Attack and for losing to a player ranked lower than you online, and in-game, there's "Wrong Answers of the Game", which pay out double winnings for being selected.
</li><li> The Flash game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infectonator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infectonator">Infectonator World Edition</a></em> has an achievement for all upgrades, but completing a level perfectly locks it from grinding. Also, you can upgrade <em>far</em> in excess of what you need to beat the game.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, the player will receive an item as a reward for finishing the game. If the player gets the good ending, they receive the infinite ammo bandana, which is handy but not indispensable. The bad ending gives them the stealth camouflage, rendering them invisible to enemies. In a stealth game, that's much more useful.
</li><li> Players can use this to their advantage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rez">Rez</a></em>. Depending on your performance in a level, you face a different version of the end boss. Shoot down less than 90% of the enemies, and get the Mega version. More than 90% but less than 98%, get the Giga version, which is somewhat tougher. More than 98% and you face the Tera version, which is even harder. Now, before playing the final stage, you can replay the previous stages. To get the most out of this, you want to kill enough enemies to get as many Progress Nodes and Overdrives as you can find, but not so much that the end boss will be tough enough to take them all away from you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit">Indigo Prophecy</a></em> has this come up a few times. Since you play as both the killer Lucas and the detectives hunting for him, sometimes it's better to do enough so Lucas doesn't panic but not so much as to make the work hard on the detectives.
<ul><li> At the very start of the game, right after Lucas kills, you're expected to do all the things you'd expect a killer to do  hide the body and the weapon, wash off the blood, act casual to avoid suspicion, and escape before the police catch on. When playing as the detectives, you have to investigate the scene of the crime, but you can't move on with the game until you find the weapon. If you made Lucas hide the weapon, the camera cuts away while Lucas hides it, so even the player doesn't know where Lucas hid it, meaning the player (as the detectives) has to hunt for it. If you "forgot" to hide the weapon, the detectives would find it on the ground at the crime scene, meaning you can move on that much easier.
</li><li> There's also one instance where you get better results from failing QTEs the game throws at you. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While Lucas is being questioned in his office, don't follow the prompts which appear when the green mites attack him, as succeeding in them causes Lucas to freak out over their appearance, which makes him appear hysterical to his interrogator who cannot see the insects.</span>

E.g. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first time (out of two possible) that Ethan is taken into custody, Norman breaks him out, establishing himself as the only cop in the game who will protect an innocent at all costs</span>.

Thus, you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">let the GUILT/Stigma pathogen create lacerations and tumors</a> for you to fix up and get points from.

</li><li> Your story progression in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenV">Raiden V</a></em> changes depending on what percentage of enemies you've destroyed at the end of the stage. In the event that you qualify for a B, A, or S route (the latter for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>), you cannot pick a lower route. This means if you want to see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, you will need to let a significant number of enemies live.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonPinball">Pokémon Pinball</a></em>, if you are aiming for a high score, you will intentionally want to come just short of clearing the Mewtwo bonus stage if you reach it (it is reached on either table by clearing the table's two unique bonus stages). It is by far the most profitable bonus stage, and the fastest way to earn points in the game. The way the stage works is that you score 50 million points per hit on Mewtwo, and it takes 24 hits to win. Ideally, you will want to get about 20 hits and then just stop playing. The reason behind this is that if you win, you'll loop back to your table's first bonus stage, but if you fail, you'll play the Mewtwo bonus stage again the next time you go to a bonus stage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PinballArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PinballArcade">Pinball Arcade</a></em>, when the Standard goals for a table are completed, the Wizard goals do not unlock until the current game ends. This means that if you're focusing on going for them, it can be beneficial to deliberately lose the ball and end your game after completing the Standard goals in order to play for the Wizard goals right away.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em>, once a Sim reaches the level 10 of their career, there is a random chance after every workday that they will be demoted to a mid-level job in another field: for example, a military general will become a SWAT team leader, or a movie star will become a Congressman. While this can add variety to the gameplay and keep things fresh, it's extremely annoying if you just want to rake in the dough, not to mention that the new career path will probably require your Sim to build more skills and make new friends to get promotions. To avoid this, many players simply have their Sims stay at the level 9 job<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4kb80');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4kb80" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4kb80');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or the one with the most positive/least negative chance cards</span>, never meeting the requirements for that last promotion.

</li><li> MSN Games' badge system sometimes forces you to do this. Each of the games has a score called High Score Level 10 (previously known as Mastery Level 10). This score must be earned during a single game to earn the badge. However, some games end too early to earn the target score if you were playing just to beat the game, so you must find creative ways to stall the game and milk as many points out of it as possible.
<ul><li> In most Match-3 games, this is done by not finishing the level goal, but just making more and more matches, only finishing levels when the time is about to run out.
</li><li> In Zuma, the only way to rack in points is to keep adding balls to the back of the chain and clear them before they reach the end of the path - this needs at least as much skill as beating all the levels in the online version.
</li><li> In Bridge, you must <em>avoid winning hands</em>, and instead let the enemy bid a high contract then play well to make them fail it, giving you points for their undertricks.

While you get the best overall reward for marrying a Beautiful daughter, some of the best early-game rewards (namely the Special Items) can be gotten through romancing the Plain and Attractive ones, but not the Beautiful ones. In addition, the rewards you get are partially dependent on how well you dance with said daughter. If you dance well with an Attractive Daughter, she will give you a quest to infiltrate an enemy colony and arrest some criminal, a reward worth less than the price of an item and generally takes considerable time and effort. However, if you only dance partially-well with her, she will give you an item instead.

Raising a ChibiBuddy involves interacting with it to raise or lower its stats (Fitness, Intelligence, Socialization, or Alignment). If any of your ChibiBuddy's stats hits zero, it dies (if it hits zero Fitness, it might have a heart attack; if it hits zero Socialization, it might literally die of loneliness), but the same goes if one of its stats hits the maximum of ten (if it reaches maximum Fitness, it might die from overtaxing itself during a work-out; if it reaches maximum Alignment, it might die from making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>).

Since the shield and the screen move on different timers, it takes a long time before they sync up if they start in a bad position. Since the initial position also depends on how fast you beat the first two stages, you're actually better off taking your time. If you beat the first two stages too fast, you'll be left waiting forever on the last stage before you can even attack.

New blue feather fragments will appear in the morning after a day of taking good care of the store. However, if you get married (for which a blue feather is necessary), your new spouse will come with a couple of event chains, for which at least the first cutscene will only play out on mornings on which you do <em>not</em> get a new fragment. Players that are doing well enough to get a fragment every day may hence have to intentionally neglect the store to see their spouse's event chains.

However, most abnormalities can cause problems from working with them incorrectly, ranging from breaching containment to instantly possessing whoever is working on them to go on a murderous rampage. And these can happen for pretty much any reason depending on the monster, including getting most of the energy you can from one work session or having a certain stat be too high.

In one story, Kindaichi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reveals the murderer by having all of the suspects take a multiple-choice test, with all of the questions secretly pertaining to the case (For example, asking where one would buy a certain type of rope, with that type of rope being what was used in the murders).

Part of the formula involves filtering oil through a rough cloth with relatively large pores, but the people producing it use expensive cloth instead and the formula fails: The original recipe relied on a certain amount of debris to pass through the poor-quality cloth, so using better stuff made it fail. This gives her the chance to sell the recipe a second time, only this time with an improved formula resulting in a better quality end product because it <em>does</em> rely on the properties of the good cloth, and then adds in another ingredient afterward to act as an abrasive.

<ul><li> In Spider Solitaire, it's possible to do so well that you clear almost all the cards off the table without ever pulling cards from the pile. Since you NEED to draw all the cards from the pile and clear them to win, though, and since you can't draw from the pile without having at least one card on every stack, it's possible to end up not having enough cards to populate every stack, and thus render the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> by doing too well, too quickly.
</li><li> A strategy used in free-for-all multiplayer <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>: Since you have multiple opponents to worry about, the last things you want to appear to be are the strongest player or the weakest player. If you're the strongest player, you get ganged up on and eliminated so that you no longer pose a threat to anyone else. If you're the weakest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">you get ganged up on and eliminated</a> because hey, one less opponent. The same principle applies to just about any multiplayer game where the players have some way of interfering with each other's progress — if your rivals see you pulling ahead, they'll target you.
</li><li> In the party game <em>Dixit</em>, the "leader" in each round chooses a card with a piece of surrealist art on it, and thinks up a word or phrase that fits that picture. The other players choose their own cards that they think fits the phrase, then vote on which card they think best fits. The leader scores no points if none of the other players vote for their card, but also scores no points if all the other players vote for their card, so the best strategy in the game is to avoid making your phrase too on-the-nose.

So far, it's a standard Prisoner's Dilemma, but here's the twist: If both chose "Trash", the money they had and lost would be split evenly between the players who were eliminated in 3rd through 5th place, so as to prevent the entire series from turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>. Since the equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma occurs when both players defect (in this case, choosing "Trash"), the runners-up splitting the money becomes arguably the most likely scenario, which meant the optimal strategy would be trying to get 3rd, 4th, or 5th place. In fact, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/mikemulqueen/status/156067731739901953">one of the finalists knew this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and it would certainly explain why several contestants who previously proved themselves skillful at the trivia portion suddenly started to perform significantly worse the instant they started the round of 5.

If you do too well during those rounds, the judges will expect much more of you during the viewer vote rounds and be harder on you, thus making it look like you're worse than you actually are, and losing you votes and possibly causing your elimination. Conversely, if you don't do that well in those rounds, the judges won't be as tough on you later on, making it look like you're better than you actually are. Furthermore, viewers tend to like the narrative of an underdog bursting through the pack and becoming a contender. Indeed, in such shows, the early favorite rarely wins. Therefore, in those rounds, a good strategy is to sing at about 80-90% of your maximum ability: well enough to get you to the viewer vote rounds, but not well enough to heap unnecessary pressure on yourself.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em>, the episode "A Bollywood Dream" sees the group's current mark realise that he's the target of a scam because the scenario was too perfect moments before he loses his short-term memory in an accident. Seizing the opportunity to con the same mark twice, the group decide to re-do the con making it a bit more imperfect as they acknowledge that a man who seeks perfection would know how hard it is to achieve. With this in mind, they adjust their scam to make the characters involved less prestigious, such as the director having a less notable reputation or their actress having studied at a minor college rather than a more prestigious one, while keeping a focus on their original agenda.

The painting was supposedly destroyed earlier in the season and if the FBI recovers the painting and authenticates it as real, they will have proof that Neal and Mozzie stole the treasure cache the painting was part of. Their only hope is to steal the real painting from its new owner and replace it with a forgery. Neal has to make the forgery look good enough that it would have reasonably fooled a knowledgeable buyer but have just enough flaws that the FBI experts can figure out it is a fake.

This resulted in a system where the longer the One drags out the game, the more money he/she would win if he/she successfully defeated the entire Mob. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gebi');"><sup>Example scenarios </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1gebi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gebi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you knocked out the entire Mob on the first question, you'd win 50,000, or 100,000 if you used the Double on the question. If you knocked out half the Mob on the first question, it'd be worth 25,000, then knocking out the other half on the second question would be worth an additional 50,000, again subject to the Double.</span> This means that the best-case scenario occurs by eliminating the Mob <em>one member at a time</em> over the course of at least 100 questions, answering every single question correctly and using the Double on the question which eliminates the last Mob member; doing so would net the One a bit over 309,000.
<ul><li> In the American version, this was at first partially fixed: it was still beneficial to knock out a greater number of Mob members at higher levels, but the prize for taking out the entire mob was $1,000,000 no matter what. In later seasons, a fixed cash prize was awarded for every 10 Mob members the One knocked out.

<ul><li> Pole vaulter Sergei Bubka, entirely dominating his sport, had a habit of only beating (often, his own) world records by just 1 cm. This was due to substantial prize money regularly offered for new world records. Every time such a prize was offered, Bubka beat his record slightly, but it was often apparent due to the amount he cleared his jumps that he was physically able to jump a lot higher than he did.
</li><li> When bowling in a handicap league, you will get more wins if you only bowl well enough to win by a few points than if you bowl a great game. This is because people get handicap points to even out the differences in their average. If someone is bowling under their average, you can lower your handicap by bowling under your average too and still win, while if they play above their average, a close win does less damage to your average than a spectacular game. Bowling a 300 will only hurt your average, with no benefit unless it was required to win that game, and even if it was, the damage it will do to your handicap next session will almost guarantee a loss. This is a form of sandbagging, and is against the rules, but very difficult to prove. People who are good enough to pull this off really should be playing "scratch" (non-handicapped), but in practice there's an area of skill where someone isn't good enough to win money in a scratch league, but can win a handicap one easily by sandbagging without getting caught. <br/><br/>Some bowling classes in schools have "improve your average by a particular amount" as part of your grade, in which case it's best to actually play poorly on purpose (but not poorly enough that your grade gets docked for failing to follow proper technique, etc.) at the beginning of the course so you have room to improve your average; playing your best on the first few days of class means you can only go downhill from there.
</li><li> As shown in 2012 Olympic badminton, poorly-designed tournaments can have this issue. Sometimes your best option is to just barely qualify with a low score, in order to face a weaker opponent in the next round. However, doing this on purpose is considered cheating. Four pairs were expelled from the Olympics for trying it.
</li><li> This thinking can save a whole season for smaller clubs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a>. If a small club manages to qualify for a continental or major cup, it should be an achievement for obvious reasons. But many times, the club doesn't have enough structure and ends up not only doing bad in the continental cup they managed to qualify, but also gets relegated in their national league since their players can't manage playing two major championships in one season.
</li><li> The 1982 World Cup group stage match between West Germany and Austria has stood as an infamous example of this. After an exciting stage that saw Algeria score a huge upset victory over West Germany in the opening match of the group, Algeria would advance to the playoffs alongside Austria if West Germany lost or drew, or alongside West Germany if they beat Austria by at least 3 goals. West Germany scored in the first 10 minutes, before both teams spent the remaining 80 minutes idly kicking the ball around in what was accused of being an organised effort to prevent Algeria advancing. The outrage was so bad that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> was implemented, requiring the final two games of each group be played simultaneously.
</li><li> The postseason tournaments for North American baseball, basketball, and ice hockey consist of a series of best-of-seven series. Since the schedule makers can't know in advance how many games each series will require, later rounds have to be scheduled assuming that earlier rounds go the limit. Teams who win their series in fewer than the maximum number of games will have some days off before the next round. While this time off can be useful in terms of resting starting players and allowing injuries to heal, teams who have <em>too</em> long a layoff tend to get rusty. In Major League Baseball, for instance, seven teams, to date, have won a best-of-seven League Championship Series in a four-game sweep. Six of those seven teams went on to lose the World Series.
</li><li> A common strategy in endurance racing. Pushing faster means more stress on the car which means more mechanical failures, and more stress on the driver, meaning a larger chance of making a mistake. Those out front will push as fast as they are willing to without taking unnecessary risks, those behind will pace themselves as fast as they need to in order to stay just close enough to make a sprint in the final hour. It gets even more confusing when you add those fuel strategy and driver swaps in the mix. Needless to say, the real winner doesn't pop up till the very end, and even then nobody is driving perfect because of all the stress, wear and tear.

But a move that would capture <em>all</em> the seeds there — a grand slam — is severely restricted. Depending on the variation being played, either the move is not legal, or the move happens but the capture doesn't, or the capture happens but your opponent then gets to take all the seeds on your side.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp">Smash Up</a></em>, points are awarded by getting minion cards onto a base card themed around one of the game's factions. Once that's done, points are allotted to the players whose minions have the most, second-most, and third-most total power. Normally the player with the most power gets the most points, but a few bases are exceptions. For instance, the Ninja faction's bases give 2 points to the first-place and third-place players and 3 points to the second-place player, meaning it's better to aim for second place rather than first.

Naturally, because the Bluecoats are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">basically just a gang of thugs with government backing</a>, you want to minimise Heat to keep them off your back...except that if you get <em>no</em> Heat, you don't earn any Rep with the criminal underworld (a useful currency), because nobody even knows it happened or that you did it! (Assassins can get an upgrade that allows them to score Rep for no-Heat jobs, but basically everyone else is out of luck.)

<ul><li> It deals out loyalty cards (which tell you if you're a human, a cylon or a cylon sympathizer) both at the start and mid-point of the game. This means that even players who start out on the human side don't want the fleet to do to well since if they end up becoming a cylon at the mid-point they will have a harder time winning. This applies even more to anyone holding a cylon sympathizer card since when the mid-point loyalty card is dealt out cylon sympathizers are assigned to the side that is currently in a weaker position.
</li><li> In fact, including the sympathize, can make it worthwhile for the human team as a whole to do this. If any resource runs out completely, the humans lose. However, if all resources are in the blue (healthy) area when the game reaches the halfway point, the sympathiser joins the Cylon team, making the game much harder for the humans. So a common strategy is to deliberately let one resource drop into the red area, but not so low it threatens to end the game. There's a reason one of the first official variant rules was a 'no sympathiser' game, and why all three expansions included replacements for the sympathiser.

</li><li> During the American Civil War, a number of enterprising printers in the Union printed fake Confederate dollars in order to cause inflation and disrupt the South's economy; the authorities did nothing to stop them, because, after all, it wasn't like the Confederacy was a real country, right? The fakes were immediately obvious because they were of much better quality than the real dollars, but they were used anyway, since everyone knew that Confederate dollars were subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates">Ridiculous Exchange Rates</a>.

</li><li> Hallmark German perfectionism doomed quite a few Nazi spies in WWII.
<ul><li> They would have impeccable forged documents on them, stapled with staples of stainless steel, which was the giveaway, since Russians used ordinary steel, and it always had rust on it.
</li><li> Some German spies attempting to infiltrate the Americans were discovered because they knew the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondVerseCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondVerseCurse">second</a></strong> verse of the U.S. national anthem, <em>The Star Spangled Banner</em>; although the anthem has four verses, only one is ever normally played, and the lyrics used are those of the first verse. This anecdote of spies being exposed by knowing too <em>much</em> of the national anthem may have begun with the Isaac Asimov short story "No Refuge Could Save", in which the German spy is caught by his knowledge of the <em>third</em> verse.

Knowing that they would be setting the minimum standard which they would later have to also pass during the twice-annual fitness tests, the vast majority of cadets would do a number of push-ups less than they actually could do, but enough to show they were putting effort into it, and then make a show of collapsing as if totally exhausted.

The artist who designed the queen piece knew he was working with meddlesome executives, and he also knew exactly what he wanted the queen to look like, how she should move, etc. So he drew her animations exactly like he wanted... and then added a pet duck that made no sense in the context. The executive told him it looked great except the duck had to go, and he ended up with exactly the original design.

<ul><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi">Ponzi</a> schemes fail quickly by offering incredible returns which immediately attract suspicion. Madoff pitched his scam as a conservative, blue-chip, 10% yearly return fund, where his clients could securely hold most of their assets, while investing the rest in riskier ventures. Since getting 10% return a year is feasible on the stock market, no one batted an eye for decades.
</li><li> On the other hand, getting almost the same returns year after year eventually attracted suspicions in the early 2000s. The whisteblowers were unfortunately ignored and the scam went on, until the 2008 crash made Madoff's investors withdraw money en masse, which exposed the massive loss of money the fund made.

</li><li> Anti-abortion evangelical Pat Robertson was opposed to various abortion bans in 2019: not because he was against them, but because the goal of the bans was to challenge and hopefully overturn Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court. While a more moderate ban would probably pass, an extreme ban (such as ones with no exceptions for rape or incest, or that would put a woman who miscarries under investigation) might have even the currently conservative Supreme Court turning up its nose.
