Often, a creator will try to put a unique spin on his or her angels.
</p><p>Angels in fiction tend, by default, to be of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCosmicDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCosmicDenominator">vaguely Abrahamic</a> nature and may or may not have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">big fluffy feathery wings</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHalo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHalo">Holy Halos</a>. They generally are found doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>'s will as part of some sort of grand plan, helping mortals (sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">incognito</a>), or otherwise staying aligned with Good.
</p><p>Angelic names, by the way, traditionally end in "-el" (meaning "of God"), such as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archangel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archangel">Archangels</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Michael</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Gabriel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael">Raphael</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel">Uriel</a>.
</p><p>The prospective angel has many options available for customization:
</p><ul><li> <strong>What is their morality?</strong> The most common way of varying things. Angels may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood">always good-aligned</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons</a> as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpartRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpartRace">Evil Counterpart Race</a>, or they may be divided into good angels and evil angels, often indicated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings">wing color</a>. If they are portrayed negatively they most often fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> trope. Given that angels are usually messengers or servants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> (the word "angel" comes from the Greek word for "messenger"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood">God Is Good</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a> tends to come into full play here; if an angel can ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">Have You Seen My God?</a> or is part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels">Council of Angels</a>, expect confusion over what is and isn't in His best interests. In a similar tangent; do angels have Free Will? Other than turning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a>; often Angels have such absolute behavioral fixations that simply considering options is <em>physically painful.</em> Often humans will get angels upset with them with inappropriate questions or observations because the angel <em>can't</em> think that way without going insane. In this way, they can be as alien as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>.

In their earliest appearances in Jewish and Christian art and literature, angels either appear fully human or else they look like some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelicAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelicAbomination">six wings, four faces, a wheel of fire with eyes lining the rim</a> — you name it. Benevolent or not, these angels were the stuff of nightmares. They didn't traditionally introduce themselves with "Fear not!" for nothing. Those that <em>were</em> winged tended to stay in heaven, or looked... different.
</li><li> <strong>Are they actually supernatural?</strong> Sometimes, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi">Sci-Fi</a>, atheist setting, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a>, angels are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">not actually supernatural</a>, merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise">confused for such</a>; whether this is intentional on their part feeds into <em>Morality</em>, above, and whether they are <em>Jerks</em>.

It may occasionally overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Is Not Good</a>, but often most people take a direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">Dark Is Evil</a> approach at describing evil angels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angels</a>, if portrayed as good, are always within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a> realm.
</li><li> <strong>How 'human' are they?</strong> If the author is trying to make a subtle point or wants to go in for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a>, they can make the angels, regardless of what they look like, be in some way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">fundamentally inhuman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">in their thinking.</a>
</li><li> <strong>Can they fall from grace? And if so, do they become Demons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angels</a>, or can they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">become human</a>?</strong> If a central character is an angel, expect an answer to this one; otherwise, tends to be left vague.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelicTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelicTransformation">Can humans become angels</a>?</strong> Most religions that believe in angels regard them as an entirely different species from humanity.

</li><li> <strong>How powerful are they?</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> and angels are sometimes weak or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">easily damaged</a> when their supernatural aspect is missing or not played up. More often, however, they are portrayed as divinely powerful badasses. They do go toe to toe with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpartRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpartRace">demons</a>, after all, and are canonically more powerful than human beings. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy">The Gods Must Be Lazy</a> is in play, the rarity of angels can combine with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a> to make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuantityVsQuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuantityVsQuality">rare but powerful compared to the common and expendable hordes of Hell</a>.

Angels in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> can belong to several classes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> doesn't mention an exact ranking for these classes; only the "archangel" class is mentioned as being higher than the others, with the other classes presumably being of the same rank but having different job descriptions.
Note also that in the Old Testament, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousStranger">Mysterious Stranger</a> characters actually do not identify themselves as angels. They can be labeled angels only by oral tradition (a good clue is a plot-pivotal character whose origins are not stated, and who deflects any questions about his name).
In Revelation, it says:
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
Revelation 12:4
The tail in this passage is talking about the tail of Satan as a cosmic dragon, and him drawing out 1/3 angels to rebel and fall with him. Notice the Bible calls them "stars", as in stars of space, the second heaven. The implication here is that angels are the stars of space themselves incarnate, which ties in why the Bible is against divination through horoscopes and astrology.
<p></p><ul><li> <em>Archangel</em>  The highest class. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Michael</a> is the only angel specified to hold this rank in the Protestant and Jewish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a> canons. It's worth noting that "arch-" as a prefix has a dictionary definition along the lines of "preeminent among all others of its kind," so linguistically there should only ever be one archangel (or arch-Enemy, or arch-Anything).
</li><li> <em>Elders</em>  There are 24 of this class as mentioned in Revelation.
</li><li> <em>Living Creatures</em>
<ul><li> Ezekiel mentions a set of four angels of this class, sometimes thought to be cherubim, having four faces: that of a lion, ox, man, and eagle. They also have two pairs of wings. Each is stationed alongside one of the four <em>Ophanim</em>, meaning "wheels", which look like eye-covered interlocking chariot wheels at the four corners of God's "chariot". The latter are sometimes described or thought to be UFOs by the general public or conspiracy theorists.
</li><li> In Revelation, John mentions another set of four angels classified among the <em>Seraphim</em>, similar yet different to those mentioned in Ezekiel. These each have a single face: one with the face of a lion, another an ox, another a man, and the last an eagle. These have three pairs of wings that are covered in eyes. They are stationed around God's throne.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Cherubim</em>  (singular <em>Cherub</em>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> is not clear on if Cherubim are a separate class from the aforementioned living creatures or not, but according to Jewish tradition, normal angels of this choir could look and often did look, human. Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArkOfTheCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArkOfTheCovenant">The Ark of the Covenant</a> and Solomon's Temple included images of angels of this class in their design that seem a little closer to Ezekiel's description though.
</li><li> <em>Seraphim</em>  (singular <em>Seraph</em>) Mentioned by Isaiah to have six wings, four of which are used to cover themselves. Their name means "burning ones".
</li><li> <em>Angels</em>  These are the ordinary inhabitants of Heaven; if something needs doing on earth, these are the guys who generally do it. Also often used as a generic term for all members of the heavenly hosts, of whatever rank or species.
</li></ul><p>There is also a traditional <em>celestial hierarchy</em> of angels, which comes from an early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Christian writing by one "Dionysius"</a> (thus, the ranking and some of the angelic classes themselves are not found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>). It divides angels into the following nine "Choirs" ordered from greatest to least, of which only the first and last two are commonly seen in art and literature:
</p><ul><li> <em>Seraphim</em> — (singular <em>Seraph</em>) Traditionally six-winged, red, and fiery; represent God's love. The reason they have six wings is to cover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">their true form</a>, which is so bright and glorious that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">all who gaze upon it (sometimes including lesser angels) are incinerated instantly</a>. They are also associated with snakes (their name is a corruption of "sarap," "fiery," more often than not connected with the word "nahash," "serpent"), and are outrightly described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">draconic</a> in appearance (see 2 Enoch and gnostic texts, for instance). Some traditions say their leader is Seraphiel, others say it's Michael. (Michael is an "archangel", but this doesn't necessarily mean he belongs to the second-lowest choir.) Satan <em>used</em> to be one of these (hence his six wings in Dante's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>). If they're <em>not</em> covered and won't set you on fire, they're described as handsome... but tall, terrifying, fiery, and speaking in Earth-shaking (quite literally) voices.
</li><li> <em>Cherubim</em> — (singular <em>Cherub</em>) Tend to be depicted in blue, or <em>as</em> blue (or red, or lots of different colors); represent God's knowledge and act as soldiers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianEntity">guardian angels</a>. St. Gabriel is Head Cherub. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a>, often misunderstood to be a single angel <em>named</em> "Cherubin." In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a>, the <em>Putti</em>, chubby little children or even a chubby face between two or more wings, were later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken">confused</a> with Cherubim (or even Seraphim, as in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lib-art.com/imgpainting/7/0/10507-stigmata-of-st-francis-domenico-ghirlandaio.jpg">this painting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> by Ghirlandaio).
</li><li> <em>Thrones</em> or <em>Ophanim</em> — Hold up God's throne, or are the living wheels of His chariot. They serve as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">headquarters</a> of the Virtues and the Upper Choirs and control the natural laws as well as being the bringers of God's justice who represent His authority (and badassery). They have the most alien physical descriptions of all the angels: wheels nested within wheels, constantly spinning, with rims covered in eyes. They may be "beryl-colored" (probably a greeny-yellow) and/or on fire. See page image.
</li><li> <em>Dominions</em> — Possibly mentioned in Protestant (Col. 1:16) and Jewish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a> canons. Wear crowns; represent God's power. Each serves as the patron angel of a nation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPresidentsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPresidentsAreDifferent">and ruler of all angels assigned to that nation.</a>
</li><li> <em>Virtues</em> — Not mentioned in Protestant and Jewish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a> canons. Traditionally wear armor and swords and are considered to control the heavenly bodies. They live in the Thrones. The previous three choirs form the bulk of the heavenly army.
</li><li> <em>Powers</em> — Possibly mentioned in Protestant (Col. 1:16) and Jewish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a> canons. Carry flaming swords and chains to bind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil">The Devil</a>; serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianEntity">guardians</a>.

Are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">Angels Of Justice</a> and are considered perfect, incorruptible ultimate angels created by God himself.

</li><li> <em>Principalities</em> — Possibly mentioned as a group in Protestant (Col. 1:16) and Jewish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a> canons. The Book of Daniel refers to a spirit that Gabriel calls "the Prince of Persia."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note130wo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note130wo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note130wo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that the "Prince of Persia" is mentioned as being <em>in opposition</em> to Michael and Gabriel, so the competing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a> is that the "Prince of Persia" and later mentioned "Prince of Greece" are actually both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons</a></em>.</span> Gabriel also identifies Michael as the Prince of Israel. Principalities traditionally bear armor and swords and watch over rulers and nations. As well as acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">the head of a specific group of angels.</a>
</li><li> <em>Archangels</em> — According to apocryphal works there are seven, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Michael</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Gabriel</a> (mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> canon but only as a normal angel), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael">Raphael</a> (appears in the deuterocanonical book of Tobit). (Names for the others, such as Zadkiel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel">Uriel</a>, and Ithuriel, don't seem to have caught on.) Each archangel is the head of one of the remaining upper choirs. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, there are seven major archangels; however, other than the Archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael the names of the others vary radically. Also the arrangement of the choirs and the status of archangels vary. In Christianity, archangels often embody a particular function or idea: for instance, Raphael is the archangel of Healing, Raguel the archangel of justice and Jegudiel of politics.
</li><li> <em>Angels</em> — Used as a name of an angelic choir, these are usually the lowest rung of the hierarchy. They function as messengers to and from Earth. Though of course, "angel" is also a general term for all members of the nine choirs, just as "archangel" is a general term for an angel in authority over other angels.
<ul><li> An interesting note, in the book of Acts, Saint Peter was imprisoned by Herod. His friends all thought he was dead, so when divine intervention rescues him and he goes knocking on their door; they think that it is "his angel." The Bible simply lists them thinking this without stating that it's correct or incorrect, but it does indicate how the "Dead people = Angels" confusion/argument has been going on at least for the last two thousand years.

He fell from heaven when the Godess accidentally sneezed in his direction and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAngel">broke his halo</a>, causing him to be stuck on the surface and unable to use any angelic powers. He has most of the regular angelic attributes, though the story develops them differently than the norm. First of all, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtherworldlyAndSexuallyAmbiguous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtherworldlyAndSexuallyAmbiguous">Otherworldly and Sexually Ambiguous</a>, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">Hermaphrodite</a> with a gender-neutral intersex appearance. His wings also float detached from his body just like his halo, with him not actually flapping them to fly. He's also fully capable of having sex with people, something he ends up doing a lot of over the course of the series, since it's about reviewing brothels, without there being any potential risk of becoming a fallen angel.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensDesignTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensDesignTeam">Heaven's Design Team</a></em>, angels serve as an intermediary between God and the Design Team.

Of course, Black also has its share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angels</a>, but in recent years a design philosophy has come down that all new angels must be at least partly White. The uniqueness of each plane's environs often leads to each plane's angels being further divergent from the standard mold.
</li><li> Mirrodin has <a class="urllink" href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/15/luminous-angel">cyborg angels<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and even one robot angel (the above Platinum Angel).
</li><li> The rebirth of Mirrodin into New Phyrexia features the angels being surgically rebuilt into near-mindless killing machines... that are still pure White — appropriate enough, given that Phyrexia is basically a freakin' horror refinery.
</li><li> Alara's are more the "classical" <em>Magic</em> type of winged female humanoids, but some <a class="urllink" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c16/199/filigree-angel">were cyberneticized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during the Conflux.

</li><li> The standard Serra family of angels come from an artificial plane created by the planeswalker Serra that was invaded and scrapped by the Phyrexians, forcing them to relocate to Dominaria.

</li><li> The angels of Innistrad are also more or less classical <em>Magic</em> angels, but <a class="urllink" href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/11/avacyn-angel-of-hope">Avacyn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, their leader, is basically a goddess in her own right (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">a created one</a>, by the vampire Sorin Markov), lording not only over her church but also over the plane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic">White Magic</a>, down to the fact that the other angels are much weaker without her. She's also a lunar deity (think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Selene</a>, only more protective), and because she was created by a vampire, a bit gothy in appearance. And while the rest of the angels in Innistrad are the traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> sort, Innistradi angels are further divided into three groups: Flight Alabaster (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Barrier Maiden</a> and occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">psychopomps</a>), Flight Goldnight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a>), and Flight of Herons (healing and scouting)

They definitely more closely resemble biblical angels, being unfathomable incarnations of White mana that represent its more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill">oppressive side</a>, and are definitely very otherworldly and weird.

<ul><li> Angel, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, is explicitly stated from the beginning to be a mutant who just happens to have various flying mutations including big white fluffy wings. Except, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later developments made him a descendant of the Cheyarafim, along with Icarus (Joshua Guthrie), and added healing blood to his powers</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nobel Kale becomes an angel when he's in hell! (On Earth, he's just a spirit who possesses people.)
</li><li> The Johnny Blaze version of the Ghost Rider later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">rewrote</a> the evil demon trapped inside Johnny into a misunderstood angel that had basically snuck in when he sold his soul. Also, there are evil angels, particularly, you know, Zadkiel.
</li><li> When first introduced into the universe, Angels tended to look like energy beings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">Dem Bones</a> was the closest they got to looking like people(looking like more advanced/powerful version of Ghost Rider, before the above retcon strangely enough). They've mostly appeared as winged humanoids since the 2000s.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AngelaMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AngelaMarvelComics">Angela</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>. Except she's actually Asgardian, daughter of Odin and Frigga, sister to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a>. But she's raised by Angels, a deity race who are in war with Asgardians.
<ul><li> Also the Angels in question are a race of winged humanoids, who are ruthless and ruthlessly effective mercenaries. Their whole culture is materialistic and cut-throat, where fighting for ideals is seen as weakness and only the strong and savvy survive.
</li></ul></li><li> Angels in the comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeInc">Afterlife Inc</a></em> are soulless, artificial beings created to ensure the healthy operation of the Empyrean, the afterlife of the title. As a rule, they lack both halos and wings, and can pretty much look like anything. Souls are also clearly overrated, as angels, generally, live full and varied in 'lives' in this new, corporate afterlife - despite some prejudice from humans.
<ul><li> The archangels, the seven former rulers of the afterlife, are a more powerful variant of angel. Following the Calamity, Anahel, ruler of the third heaven, Shehaqim, is the only known surviving archangel.
</li></ul></li><li> In the vampire comic book <em>Crimson</em>, angels are invisible but tangible winged humanoids with odd tattoos. People with special goggles can kill them so they can eat them, as angel blood gives a narcotic effect. If an angel disobeys orders, they're demoted into a mortal, but if they live out a good human life they can ascend to being an angel again after death. The archangel Michael thinks he's in charge of them all, but he and the other archangels aside from Satan are total assholes, and God is really pulling all their strings for benevolent reasons. Satan is the only one who realizes this and seems content at the situation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em>: Fitting right in with the comic's views on religion, angels are not shown in a very flattering light. Two variants are shown: The Seraphi, warrior angels who stand at the right side of God (one of which was compelled to have sex with a succubus, creating Genesis), and the Adephi, who stand at the left side of God and are more scientifically minded (they were the ones holding Genesis once it was created). Two Adephi, in particular, are singled out as being ineffectual middle management types and chinless wonders. When one of them tries to dazzle Jesse Custer with the glory of the Heavenly Host, he is immediately told to "cut the shit."
</li><li> So far, we've seen two classes of angel as they appear within the universe of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em> comic, neither of which really fit the well-known winged humanoid archetype. The Grigori, or Watchers, which look more or less like human skeletons on fire &amp; the Seraphim, which apparently resemble giant grubs with black mask-like faces &amp; wings made from flayed human skin. One scientist goes mad from isolation and opens a portal to what he thinks are angels, who look like nothing seen on Earth.
</li><li> There seem to be three kinds of angel in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>:
<ul><li> Standard angels. Zauriel from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> is one of these (and so, according to the most generally accepted of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">four origin stories</a>, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePhantomStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePhantomStranger">The Phantom Stranger</a>). Wings, flaming sword, humanoid but inhuman looking. Divided into four "hosts": Man, Bull, Eagle, and Lion. Zauriel of the Eagle Host was technically a fallen angel during his time with the League (he was a guardian angel who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">cared too much about the woman he was guarding</a>), but not <em>as</em> fallen as his arch-enemy Azmodel of the Bull Host, who was working with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Neron</a>.
</li><li> Earth-born angels. Earth-born angels are formed when someone sacrifices themselves to save someone without hope, causing the two to merge together. There are three Earth-born angels; the Angel of Fire, the Angel of Love and the Angel of Light. During the run of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> title the Angel of Fire was Supergirl (who manifested flaming wings and enhanced heat vision), the Angel of Love was Comet (who had icy wings and emotion manipulation) and the Angel of Light was Blythe (who had glowing wings and could project light <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">and was working for a demon called the Carnivore</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">personification</a> of God's Wrath is often referred to as an angel, but it's not clear where he fits in. One interpretation (based on Neil Gaiman's original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBooksOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBooksOfMagic">The Books of Magic</a> mini) is that he's one of the original archangels who made a really stupid, not necessarily evil, mistake when the world was young and God wants him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">work it off</a>. Current continuity has him as an aspect of God-given independent existence, outside of the standard angelic hierarchy, with his fellow aspects of God (like the Radiant) as peers.
</li><li> And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Azrael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Azrael">Azrael</a>. While he's not a real angel, his appearance, for whatever unfathomable reason, immediately just shouts "angel" in the minds of any DCU citizens he comes across.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a> <em>Hellstorm</em> series introduced the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/asuraa.htm">Asura<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, AKA the Assassins of Heaven, typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> angels who prove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Is Not Good</a> by fanatically trying to stamp out free will, figuring that to be the source of evil. They later get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> as a race of bird-people (of which several exist in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>) altered by magic, rather than actual angels, and the "God" they follow as the arch-demon Chthon trying to eliminate the competition or something. Asuras were introduced again as the guardians of heaven's gates. Mainly so Zadkiel would have more targets.
</li><li> Bill, the Angel of the Lord in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PropositionPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PropositionPlayer">Proposition Player</a></em>, looks less like an angel and more like a freakishly muscled mafia legbreaker, who tries to scare the protagonist into giving up his attempts to get into the soul business and who generally abuses his position as a henchman in the most powerful religion for petty reasons like sex. (He apparently sent a guy to hell just so he could take his girl, and tries to force a minor goddess into having sex with her.) His boss Michael furthers the mafia stereotype; he arranges for the casino to explode and kill many of the people who sold their souls and tortures the protagonist's girlfriend. He even delivers a short lecture on certain aspects of torture at one point. And he wears barbed wire under his clothes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac">Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</a></em> has a few weird ones, ranging from vaguely humanoid things with no ears &amp; goggles built into their heads to angel bunny things that are less beings in their own right &amp; more part of the scenery of Heaven. Also features a Throne that trades the flaming wheel look for that of a spindly technorganic monster... with a recliner on his back.
</li><li> The angels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em>) are mainly warriors. The exception is cherubim which are balls of light that communicate in emotions. To elaborate, Remiel and Duma (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">angel of silence</a>) are shown as two blonde, half-naked winged Bishonen whose feet "never touch the impure ground." They ended up ruling in hell, with...mixed results to say the least.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkness">The Darkness</a></em> has "The Legion of the Cherub Hostile." Another example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Is Not Good</a> in the series, they're a horde of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">childlike</a> angels who wield little bows and flaming swords. And are intent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">purging all life</a>.

<ul><li> The fic takes Eva's Angels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. In this story, the Angels appear to be more or less immortal (though not invincible), can spawn life in their own image (though they need to combine with Adam to do this across the whole Earth), and their physical bodies appear to be only <em>part</em> of the creature, with their minds a separate and eternal form on another plane of reality. In addition, several "orders" of Angels have been identified: the canon Angels appear to be the Archangels, other than them, we also have the Cherubim, Dominions (only one has appeared), Thrones (only one has appeared), Grigori, and it's hinted the Seraphim will soon be appearing. Each order is equally as alien as the main set but differ in their goals and power levels to some extent. Angel/human hybrids are termed Nephilem.
</li><li> A Seraphim had already appeared, it just wasn't known. Leliel, the Dirac Sea, is one of them. There's also the bizarre hybrid of Lilim, Grigori, and Archangel known as 02EfA9iel, created by one of Kei's mindbabies taking a prototype Grigori-based Eva way beyond its operational limits in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/NobodyDiesSixAIsOneContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/NobodyDiesSixAIsOneContinent">Six AI's, One Continent</a>.

Their features include multiple sets of wings, animal masks and their leader The Seraphim has a strong association with fire. Cassandra Cain, who operates as The Angel of The Bat, also doesn't have a whole lot angelic to her costume, mostly just its use of white and a cross through the middle of her Bat symbol.

<ul><li> The 'A' class of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Incubators</a> had appeared of these in ancient times to manipulate men and tempt young girls into becoming Puella Magi (namely, they contracted Eve, whose wish <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">doomed mankind to be targeted by the Incubators in the first place</span> and Hagar). Eventually, when a line about Satan appearing as an angel of light made it into the Bible, the 'A' class were phased out and replaced by the 'B' class that Kyubey comes from.
</li><li> Witches that somehow retained memories of their humanity were also called angels. The witch Gabriel (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the witch form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Aisha</a></span>) was one of these, as was Pandora of Greek mythology. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Homura somehow becomes one of these as well, despite Madoka's wish to erase witches before they were born.</span>

While much of their time is spent healing people during battles and rescuing civilians, they are quite ready to mix it up with evil, particularly the Animals (another PG). They are led by Trelayna of the Rock, a woman merged with a rock who has enormous telepathic powers. She also is batshit insane and demands incredibly strict behavior from her followers, staying in their minds to ensure that they meet her standardswhich is why nearly all of them are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">artificial intelligences</span>. Trelayna badly wants the winged John, the very visual epitome of an angel, to joinbut there's about as much a chance of that happening as there is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> four will suddenly start killing things.

<ul><li> One of the protagonists' original complaints about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">title character</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Michael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Michael">Michael</a></em> is that they "thought they were cleaner." Michael, being an archangel (and one of God's Storm Troopers), cheerfully indicates that he's "not that kind of angel." He also smoked heavily and used his angelic powers to seduce women, but did have big fluffy wings (although the feathers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMolt">fell out as he neared the end of his time on Earth</a>). As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline">Tagline</a> said, "He's an Angel, not a Saint."
</li><li> The urSkeks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a></em> were luminous beings of light that got cast out of their home and ended up on Thra, where they taught the local races many sciences (much like the Grigori in Apocrypha). In a hasty attempt to get back home by purifying themselves, they instead divided themselves into two types of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a>: the light Mystics and the dark Skeksis, both mortal and aging. If one of either dies, so does its light/dark counterpart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They are refused into urSkeks at the end and go back to Heaven</span>.

In the former, they are too early and the latter too late.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy">Hellboy II: The Golden Army</a></em>: The Angel of Death. Or possibly AN Angel of Death, as she specifically states that she's "Hellboy's Death." To say that this angel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">very weird</a> is a massive understatement. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro">Guillermo del Toro</a> apparently based "her" on Mexican angel paintings which depict them as having eyes on the wings (maybe the biblical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">weird looking</a> angels weren't forgotten after all). Also doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a> example as being at worst neutral and by having the wings colored black.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>, If they have their wings cut off, it transforms them into humans (which apparently doesn't work for demons or fallen angels), and they can't drink alcohol (although that was mainly a restriction put on them after one angel had a few too many and insulted The Big Man). Metatron is said to have 36 wings with eyes and mouths all over his body, each mouth said to speak a different language, but in the movie, he only had 2 wings, even though he did first manifest as a torrent of flame. The other two angels of the film, although disgraced, seem to have powers retaining to their old posts, with Bartleby, a Grigori, knowing everyone's personal history by looking at them, and Loki, the angel of death, mentioned to be able to "rain sulfur" (although he doesn't seem to enjoy doing so). When in battle, both are (nearly) invulnerable to our mortal protagonists.
<ul><li> Also, angels are as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll, which appears to be a mistake at first, as according to Genesis angels are very capable of doing the deed and making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half Human Hybrids</a>, but It makes sense in the context of the movie. After all, much of the plot is based on how God can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> new rules for angels whenever S/He likes, as with the ban on alcohol after Loki's little tantrum. It would make perfect sense that God would castrate the angels to stop more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim">Nephilim</a> from being born.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Really</em> messed around in substantial ways in the trilogy of films commencing with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProphecy">The Prophecy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Written/directed by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0927074/">Gregory Widen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and starring Christopher Walken as a very disenchanted Archangel Gabriel, it suggests that whilst Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen no less!) rebelled because he didn't like God, another portion of angels rebelled because they didn't like the idea of man being more important than angels and that the war between the loyal angels of God and the rebels has kept heaven's gates closed against even the souls of men getting there. The angels' attitude towards humans are made clear by multiple angels dismissing them as "talking monkeys" and by Gabriel's diatribe to Thomas.
<div class="indent"><strong>Gabriel</strong>: I'm an angel. I kill firstborns while their mamas watch. I turn cities into salt. I even, when I feel like it, rip the souls from little girls, and from now till kingdom come, the only thing you can count on in your existence is never understanding why.
</div></li><li> Angels have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, agility, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> that borders on teleportation. They have wings but can hide them under clothes. The only way to kill an angel is to rip out or stake their hearts. Gabriel specifically is shown to be able to make people fall asleep just by telling them to, set things on fire by muttering a few phrases and bring back people who have committed suicide and make them immortal and invulnerable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Constantine">Constantine</a></em> uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> variety with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Archangel Gabriel</a>, who turns out to be quite the jerk. However, Gabriel is not an angel in the purest sense; since Angels and Demons of the purest degree are not permitted on Earth, the angels seen in the film are deceased mortals imbued with Divinity as a reward for good works during life. So, the Gabriel in this movie isn't the famous archangel. Just a dead Christian woman, who happened to be named Gabriel.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityOfAngels">City of Angels</a></em>, the angel protagonist falls in love with a human woman and decides to become human to be with her after hearing the story of a former angel who's now a happily married mortal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then she dies, and he either commits suicide or becomes an angel again, depending on your interpretation of the ending.</span> Both in this and the original <em>Der Himmel uber Berlin</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingsOfDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingsOfDesire">Wings of Desire</a></em>) angels are trenchcoat-wearing, normal-looking humans with the twist that the protagonists usually can't see them. They are implied to have worn armour in the past though (the main character pawns his to buy warmer clothes when he becomes human).
</li><li> The angels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelsInTheOutfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelsInTheOutfield">Angels in the Outfield</a></em> and related films fit the standard good-guys-with-wings image, as befits a feel-good kids' movie. They are repelled by foul language, being pure and ethical in all respects except, it seems, for cheating at sports, which is perfectly okay if <em>they're</em> the ones doing it.

<ul><li> Though not an "angel" per se (actually "a singular cherubim," and no, that's not an error), Proginoskes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWindInTheDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWindInTheDoor">A Wind in the Door</a></em> matches Ezekiel's idea of an angel: a composite of wind and flame at his heart, extending into dozens of immense wings and myriad, blinking eyes. (He finds it easier to not be corporeal at all, and scorns the human idea of "little pigs with wings.") Proginoskes' great skill is to Name people, and the key to naming is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">love.</a> After all, Cherubim are supposed to be the embodiments of God's love.

The seraphim are basically servants of God on earth and usually have eyes and wings coloured in some variant of gold, silver or blue. The nephilim, which are implied to be fallen angels, have eyes and wings of more vivid colours like red and violet. They are all immortal, and not outright antagonistic with each other, but the nephilim are trapped on earth where the seraphim can return to heaven. Nephilim are male and enjoy sleeping with human women and fathering children on them; seraphim are androgynous and celibate (although they sometimes fall in love). Also, each one, seraphim and nephilim, has an animal form into which he can change — though the nephilim take the shapes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">worms, snakes, dragons, and other ugly things.</a>

<ul><li> Angels, or <em>eldila</em> (singular <em>eldil</em>) are beings whose bodies are purportedly made out of light, and occupy a different state of matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">moving with respect to the universe</a> (rather than with respect to a planet's surface). Human eyes can barely detect them as shimmers of light, only allowing themselves to be seen for what they are when the purpose serves them.
</li><li> The <em>Oyeresu</em> (singular <em>Oyarsa</em>) are more powerful beings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">that control the nature of each planet</a> in the solar system. Although most are benevolent and love their subjects, the Oyarsa of Thulcandra (earth) is clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> and, unlike the others, is actually trapped within the moon's orbit to prevent further harm. The Oyeresu, like the eldila, have no genders but some have masculine and feminine identities. Furthermore, they have the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">manifest themselves as they choose</a>; at the close of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Perelandra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Perelandra">the second book</a>, the Oyeresu of Mars and Venus manifest as white, fiery giants.
</li><li> Further complicating the picture, the Oyeresu, as described in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThatHideousStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThatHideousStrength">That Hideous Strength</a></em>, have a sort of shadow presence on each planet, which seems to act more or less independently. <em>These</em> are the "gods" that some Tellurians have reportedly met.

The "angel," as he is referred to by the villagers who find him, is an old, flea-infested, wrinkled man with no teeth and crippled, barren wings. He could be injured, ate food (albeit mashed up as he couldn't chew), did not recognize men of the cloth, and spoke in a strange tongue. Note that the whole point of the story is the question of whether the man was really an angel or not.

</li><li> Aziraphale is also specifically stated to be a Principality, but doesn't like to tell people because they make jokes.

They appear in the books as translucent, winged humans but this is simply for the convenience of humans, and because human minds are too tiny to comprehend their true appearance; their real forms are described as being somewhat like architecture. And sometimes they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys">very, very gay.</a> Undebatably gay, since they do really have psychosocially formed genders and the lack of sex in Balthamos and Baruch's relationship doesn't make them less gay.

They are incorporeal spirits, but are able to take on any physical form they choose to. None of them follow the usual feathered-wings-and-halo motif: Gandalf and the other wizards, the Balrog, and Sauron (and possibly the dragons and giant eagles) are all Maiar. Of course, the Balrog is a pretty traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demon</a>.

</li><li> Novelist/Irish Catholic priest Andrew M. Greeley wrote a trilogy of novels, <em>Angel Fire</em>, <em>Angel Light</em>, and <em>Contract With an Angel</em>, in which he depicts angels as benevolent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, immense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> who can assume (or project a simulation of) human form, are capable of love and reproduction among themselves, and enjoy playing matchmaker among humans. Although they are aliens, they claim to be in direct communication with, and employment by, God. Notably, <em>Angel Light</em> is a modern retelling of the book of Tobit, one of the books of the Apocrypha, the non-canonical stories of the Bible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ILucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ILucifer">I, Lucifer</a></em> features angels who are not winged humanoids but rather celestial beings of metaphysical energy. Angels suffer from pain if they commit evil acts (Angelic Pain), as well as corrupt their essence. This means demons are <em>technically</em> still Angels but are consumed with unimaginable pain constantly and their visage is a horrific reflection of their nature. They are also immortal and their numbers are unchanged since God brought them into existence.

Once, an angel even appeared to her without being summoned. (The traditional nine-fold hierarchy is in effect.)
</li><li> In <em>Angelology</em> angels fall into three political categories: the loyal, who it is suggested are all female; the rebellious, who were apparently destroyed; and the Watchers, who also fell by mating with human women and producing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim">Nephilim</a>. The Watchers were imprisoned on Earth in a deep cave system which is where the story of Hell comes from. Meanwhile, the Nephilim spread and enslaved humanity until they were wiped out in the Flood—except for one who killed Noah's son Japheth and took his place. All Caucasians are descended either from Japheth's human children or from the Nephilim who killed him. The descendants have manipulated and ruled humanity from behind the scenes ever since.

Beyond this, he looks like a physically inspiring leader. Other angels are imposing, but less so.

Originally, the vampires were bloodthirsty serial killers, and the angels were hailed as heroes for exterminating every one they came across. But over time, normal people began joining the vampires, but the angels continued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">treating them as pure evil</a>. By the time the series starts, the angels have been forced to move away from their anti-vampire stance a bit, but many of them still hold to the old party line. Ironically, the angels have no problem with the demons.
</li><li> L.A Weatherly's Angel Fire trilogy:
<ul><li> Angels appear to be beautiful humanoids with wings and halos, but are in reality parasitic lifeforms that feed from the essence of human beings. Being touched by one results in getting Angel Burn, which manifests as either slowly increasing mental damage or various fatal and debilitating diseases. Angels are aware they do this and do not care, actively feeding on humanity and seeking to control them. They can take human form and cannot be killed in this form, but in turn cannot use their powers to kill. When in angel form they can be killed by the destruction of their halo. They are also not connected with God, they are actually beings from another dimension.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Half-Angels though are exceedingly rare, only two exist and it is unknown just how as angels do not reproduce sexually, but they are different. They do not cause Angel Burn and do not have halos, thus they cannot be killed unless their human side is killed. They manifest as people with two sides to themselves, both sentient and aware but in essence the same person. They are also able to read a person's future by touching them, but cannot see futures where they are more than passingly involved.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Cynthia Hand's Hallowed series:
<ul><li> There are three types of angels. Angels serve God and are typical angels. Blackwings are Fallen Angels, the Nephilim to be precise, who chose to mate with human women and caused the third kind of angel to exist, Angel-Bloods. Angel-bloods come in two types; Dimidius, a child of an angel and a human and Quartarius, a child of a Dimidius and a human. Angel-Bloods are born with a Purpose, the reason they were born, and will at some point receive dreams about it. They must fulfill their Purpose or they will become a Blackwing, an angel who has forsaken God. Blackwings are in constant misery due to their separation from heaven, are incapable of flight due to said misery but can shapeshift into different forms, and are at war with the Angels.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is revealed that a third kind of Angel-Blood exists. Triplare, the child of a Dimidius and an Angel. They are exceedingly powerful, as close to an Angel as possible but they have free will. Only seven exist at a time. Three have been revealed in the series, the protagonist Clara, her brother Jeffrey and her romantic interest Christian.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Jury Macntier</em>: The Angels in Cloudia all have certain powers, and some are not what you'd expect an angel to have. For example, Goldalocks is a Wealth Angel, and is incredibly greedy, cruel, and cold-hearted. When revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jury doesn't have magical powers or abilities</span>, she laughs at her and throws money at her. Another example is Maybella's friend, Saffron. Saffron is a Lust Angel, and since those are not permitted in Cloudia, Queen Lilac took away her magic, so Saffron is stuck on Cloudia without any lust or sex, what she wants the most. She normally hates on Jury and wears almost nothing but ribbons. Granted, the Angels aren't as bad as the Demons from Fireda. The Demons eat flesh, drink blood, steal, murder, etc. Compared to them, these Angels seem holy.

The world is divided up into territories, one for each Archangel, which they rule over as they see fit. In this universe, angels <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">produce a toxin that must be discharged regularly or they are driven insane</span> so vampires are created from willing human populations. Guild Hunters exist to bring rogue vampires back to the angel that Made them, or destroy them if necessary.
</li><li> In Ted Chiang's novella <em>Hell is the Absence of God</em> angels look like writhing knots of white fire and operate on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, their presence causing miracles both good and bad without any discernable rhyme or reason. Fallen angels, on the other hand, are mysterious and close-mouthed about their reasons for rejecting God but do neither harm nor good.
</li><li> Angels apparently exist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfTheLamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfTheLamp">Children of the Lamp</a></em>, and are said to be made of Light (just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Mundanes</a> are made of Earth and Water and Djinn are made of Fire). They do serve God, but almost nothing else is known about them, except that they have powers that even Djinn find incredible, and sometimes disguise themselves as homeless people so they can find kind and generous humans to bless. We only meet one of: Afriel, the Angel of Youth, who is responsible for causing Miracles, Marvels, Omens, Eye-Openers, etc. (Except on Sundays, I never work on Sundays.)

The titular angel was actually created to sing in the heavenly choir, but his complete lack of a musical sense forced him to be reassigned to the Ninth Legion made up of warrior angels. Mozart has a surfer's build, but even he fails in comparison to a true warrior angel. None of them have wings, though, as it's kinda hard to blend in among the humans with wings. Their task is to fight any evil creatures, with vampires being the greatest enemy. It's noted that all angels lack nipples and bellybuttons. Despite this, no one notices Mozart's lack of those, even when he's walking around shirtless. Another strange thing about them is that angels do not dream, although Mozart has a dream near the end of the novel.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven">Highway to Heaven</a></em>, angels look just like humans. They do have supernatural knowledge and are implied to be able to teleport and use telekinesis (in the first episode, an Angel uses this to cause a car to break down to give him a lift; how very angelic). They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">wander the Earth</a> or at least middle America, doing good deeds. This is carried over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em>, though the titular angels do get an inner light when they're being particularly inspirational, which isn't always a good thing. One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em>, set on October 30, 1938, had then-rookie angel Monica turning on her angel glow to calm down a crowd that was panicked by reports of a Martian Invasion (they were listening to Orson Welles' radio broadcast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em>).

So to humans at least, they look like fluffy-winged angels. Londo Mollari, however, saw nothing. Though never outright stated, it's implied that he didn't see anything because he's been touched by the Shadows (other theories like the Centauri weren't groomed by the Vorlons have also been put forward).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series got into the game by introducing Castiel (an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarahsarchangels.com/C.html">angel of Thursday<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> apparently) who dragged Dean out of Hell and gave us the page quote. Design choices were clearly made with inspiration from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingsOfDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingsOfDesire">Wings of Desire</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProphecy">The Prophecy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a>,</em> and probably a little bit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>.
</li><li> The angels of this setting give every indication of being fundamentally beings of light (Castiel calls it a "multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent"), though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Zachariah</a> says "in Heaven I have six wings and four faces, one of which is a lion," and in the next season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Castiel</a> refers to his own true form as being "roughly the size of your Chrysler Building," after which Dean tells him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">"All right, all right, quit bragging."</a>
</li><li> As they are unable to <em>safely</em> or effectively interact with matter in these forms, they must, with explicit permission, occupy human hosts to do anything in the world (demons in the setting do the same thing, but without asking permission). The collateral damage from their forms is also apparently the preferred form for combat since an otherwise-improbable percentage of the dead angel count are killed by stabbing while in vessels.
</li><li> Without using traditional wings, they've raised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a> to an art form, using it in place of traditional flight powers, though they can manifest echoes of wings (Castiel with shadows, Raphael with lightning, and so on) and they sometimes get a feather-ruffle sound effect when teleporting. Their death throes result in a burned imprint of wings on whatever surface(s) they were on, as seen from above, as well as a little falling ash for visual effect.
</li><li> In keeping with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> they were introduced to, these angels are mostly quite unhappy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">God has been AWOL for ages</a>, but since no one ever really had contact with him, most of them don't know. Heaven is attempting to start the Apocalypse while pretending to stop it because a) the prophecy is the closest thing they've got to divine will b) something needs to change. Zachariah likes the power grab, Michael really wants to settle things with his brother, Raphael is disillusioned by God's absence, Gabriel is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">off impersonating Loki</span>, and Lucifer wants to punish Daddy for abandoning them by breaking His favorite toy, the human race. There are mind games and betrayals and quite a lot of blood since apparently most angel magic is blood-based and it must be smeared on things.
</li><li> Heaven is an extremely strict military organization, with Michael as the first general of the whole lot, and handing orders down through the ranks to the soldiers on the ground. Obedience is absolute, and torture to keep the angels in line is quite common. From lowest to highest, the Angel ranks are roughly Nephilim (considered abominations) -&gt; Cherubim (Cupids) -&gt; Angels (regular angels) -&gt; Seraphim (higher-tier angels) -&gt; Archangels (first tier angels).
</li><li> There's a wide variety of angel personalities, even as it broke up in interesting ways. Uriel is a coldblooded bastard, Zachariah is a heartless creep, Anna and Balthazar are two very different flavors of hedonist, while Gabriel's a bit like Balthazar only all sense of humor and phenomenal cosmic archangel powers... Michael is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a> to the illogical extreme, and Lucifer is mild-mannered, casually cruel, and quite terrifying.
</li><li> Angels can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">turned into humans</a> by having their celestial essence, called "Grace" removed. Most angels cut off from Heaven will slowly lose their powers, although the higher tiers are more immune to these effects.
</li><li> But angels do not become demons; if they undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, they stay angels, just bad ones. Demons are former humans, essentially superpowered ghosts.
</li><li> Angels do not have genders and use their hosts' pronouns for convenience. Some prefer vessels of a specific sex (Michael, for example, prefers male vessels) and some (such as Raphael) have no preference. Others, like Cas and Anna, only feel comfortable in a specific vessel, and use replicas of that vessel after the original body is destroyed (since vessels usually become useless once the owner's soul departs, this takes either "calling in some favors" or direct divine intervention).

Their wings are strictly metaphorical: although they never manifest any actual wings, having their powers revoked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels">Council of Elders</a> is referred to as having their "wings clipped." Normal Whitelighters are always shown to be dedicated servants of good, but their bosses, the Elders, are generally distant at best, and at least one becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the sixth season.

Paige, the youngest sister is actually technically an angel as well. Her mother had an affair with her Whitelighter and got pregnant with her as a result. She has Whitelighter powers in addition to her Charmed ones, but she can also be killed by mortal causes and it's likely she won't live forever.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dominion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dominion">Dominion</a></em> angels seem to be arranged in a hierarchy similar to tradition but with the lowest rank, referred to colloquially as "Eight Balls" indistinguishable from demons who lack a physical form and need to possess a human to manifest. The angels at the top are the Archangels with Gabriel waging war on humanity, thinking that destroying them will cause God (whom the Archangels all refer to as their father) to reappear and Michael taking their side. Most Eight Balls are servants of Gabriel and he has recently been joined by some of the Powers. Uriel meanwhile, who's a woman, seems to be playing both sides and there are angels of undisclosed rank hiding among humans. Oddly, all of them have black wings, even the good ones.
</li><li> The Lords in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito">Kamen Rider Agito</a></em> give of a somewhat angelic vibe.

When summoning their weapons, or are at the point of dying, a halo appears above their head. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They actually are angels. In this series, the equivalent of God is revealed to be evil. Or at least a control freak that wants to lord over his creation, namely humanity, with an iron fist.

"God", of course, is unhappy with this, and sends his angelic Lords to earth to kill off every human showing the tendency to evolve into an Agito.</span>

If killed, they reappear at once from the nearest door. The only way to stop them is thus incapacitation. So far the only exception is the Saint of Killers, whose gun kills an angel (at his request). Most are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">middle management types</a>, but one seraph shows up as well, a sort of warrior angel apparently.
</li><li> Only three angels are shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em>: Lucifer himself (power of getting humans to reveal their deepest desires), his oldest brother Amenadiel (loyal servant of their father), and the middle brother Uriel (ability to see and affect patterns). All three have wings, although each has different wings, depending on his personality: Lucifer's are the standard "angelic white" and fluffy, indicating that he's a better person than he claims to be, Amenadiel's are metallic black and sharp, indicating his status as God's warrior and enforcer (they later turn gray and soft, symbolizing his change in character), and Uriel's are similar to Lucifer's but dirty-gray, showcasing his calculating mind and willingness to bend the rules. There is also mention of their sister Azrael, the Angel of Death. It's not clear how many angels there are total or if there are any other female angels besides Azrael. All angels are referred to as children of God <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the Goddess</span>, so their relationship is frequently portrayed as that of a typical family with a distant father.
<ul><li> By the end of season 4, two more angels appeared: Azrael and Remiel. Both are portrayed as female. While Azrael's wings are of a relatively light shade, but not as bright as Lucifer's, Remiel's wings resemble a bird of prey. Among the family members mentioned up to this point are Gabriel, Michael, and Castiel. In season 4 the first half-angel appears with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Linda's and Amenadiel's son Charlie.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Myths &amp; Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, valkyries perform many of the same functions as Judeo-Christian angels, acting as messengers of Odin and gatherers of dead souls. They aren't winged but their horses are. Oh, and they rode wolves before horses. The war god they served was not viewed as a well-intentioned figure in their earlier tales and even after Odin became popular they were still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">usually the cause of death for the souls they took away.</a> Similar to angels, they were pretty frightening but became associated with beautiful people and such later.
</li><li> While having a completely different function, the Sirens and the Anemoi (wind gods) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek Mythology</a> were depicted as angels are today, being, in fact, the origin of their modern winged humanoid appearance. Somewhat closer in the role and also depicted as winged humanoids were Eros, Thanatos, and Hypnos.
</li><li> Putti, who were profane in Hellenistic culture, were adopted as Christian symbols of God's omnipresence later in Italy.
</li><li> Supernatural creatures that were not outright gods or monsters were called daemones. Good ones were Eudaemones and when Christianity became the official religion in the Roman empire the righteous dead (saints) and angels became eudaemones... partly why people erroneously think of them as the same thing.
</li><li> The word <em>tenshi</em> (lit. <em>servants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">heaven</a></em>) is currently the Japanese word for angel. Originally, it referred to a kind of <em>kami</em> whose actual role and form were lost to time.
<ul><li> This may have to do with the influence of Buddhism that gave rise to the concept of <em>tennin</em>, Heavenly People, that serve a similar purpose which may explain why they were used as a loan word for Judeo-Christian angel.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain types of Dragons in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology">Chinese Mythology</a> serve the same purpose to Judeo-Christian angels, bearing messages from heaven and back and so forth.
</li><li> Yazatas served a similar role as Angels in Indo-Persian Zoroastrian mythology, with Amesha Spentas being similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchAngels">Arch Angels</a>. Scripture calls them beings <em>worthy of worship</em> or <em>worthy of veneration</em>. At the time Persians and Hebrews got along very well, which lead to several Yazatas and the Amesha Spentas coming to be viewed as Angels. One example is the Yazata Sraosha became equated with the Angel Surush.
</li><li> One scholarly Jew, Maimonides, proposed that the amber light coming from God's fire cloud and shining on the angels Ezekiel described <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">was itself an angel of the hashmallim choir</a>. The Dominions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Christian tradition</a> are basically watered-down versions of the same concept.
</li><li> Samael is different enough in Jewish folklore already, his most notably being both evil and good at the same time and being so big it would take five hundred years of traveling before someone covered a distance equal to his height (and of course being covered in eyes). In some Gnostic sects, Samael was equated with Yaltabaoth, a lion-headed serpent that ruled over at least 365 pseudo angelic archons.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism">Archons</a> from gnostic works are heavenly regents created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">Yaldabaoth</a> (supposed to be the Judeo-Christian Yahweh but also borrows from the platonic demiurge), and the top ones, the Hebdomad, are basically planetary archangels. However, they are at best oppressive and at worst outright hostile, devouring the souls of the dead. To drive the point home, many are equated with actual Hebrew angels. Though the "real" Hebrew angels are occasionally seen in gnostic traditions and are independent, benevolent beings. It's complicated.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, angels are created as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace">Servant Race</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Allah</a>. They are similar to angels in Christianity only in that they are good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> that can take on a human form, but they differ in many ways. They're free to question the motives behind God's decisions, as they did when he announced his intention to create Adam, but are unable or unwilling to disobey God in any fashion because they lack free will. Some traditions regarding the Battle of Badr, where the Muslims defeated an army 3 times their number, tell that Angels actually fought alongside the Muslims in battle.
<ul><li> A notable conclusion to angels lacking free will is that angels are literally unable to rebel against God. As a result, there is no such thing as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a> in Islam. Satan (either called <em>Shaitan</em>, its Arabic equivalent, or <em>Iblis</em>, from the Greek word <em>diabolos</em>) is not an angel, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGeniesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGeniesAreDifferent">jinni</a>. The jinn are God's second creatures, after angels but before humans, and somewhat a middleway between them; they are supernatural (<em>ghaib</em>), but they have free will and can choose to be either good or bad.
</li><li> Some angels are delegated tasks pertaining to humans. There is Gabriel the messenger, but there are also a pair of angels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">who sit on humans' shoulders and record their deeds</a>, another pair of angels who question human souls upon their entry to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurgatoryAndLimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurgatoryAndLimbo">Barzakh</a>, and angels who guard the gates of Heaven and Hell. Yes, Hell is guarded by an angel (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft">although he is a very scary one</a>).

They're terribly pleased with their positions (and name badges!) but much to Satan's frustration, don't actually have the authority to decide anything, and won't pass messages on because God asked not to be disturbed.

There're seven of them, who are named after -and identified with- the seven archangels of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Christianism of the setting</a>, all but one of them have adopted female gender, and each one of them have associated a set of ideas and concepts (for example, Gabriel represents among other things love, arts, and peace and Uriel -the unique male- freedom, independence, and free will)

<ul><li> The catch-all term "celestial" is used to refer to beings from the Upper Planes, "angels" (or "aasimon" when 2nd Edition was trying to appease the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>) are celestials who directly serve gods, and "asuras" are former angels who left their gods' service for various reasons (they're still on the side of good, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">but don't take crap from anyone)</a>. All are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfGood">Made of Good</a> and have innate supernatural abilities, and while celestials cannot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possess mortals like fiends can</a>, some mortal spellcasters learn to act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">Willing Channelers</a> for them. They are not infallible, however, and some celestials end up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angels</a>, resulting in them being driven from their heavenly homes. Like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">fiends</a>, celestials include several subtypes based upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a>, but while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">devils</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">demons</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">yugoloths</a> wage the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Blood War</a>, the Upper Planes are free of that sort of vicious infighting — even the most lawful of archons would rather tolerate the chaos of an eladrin than the evil of a devil.
<ul><li> Archons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> celestials from the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia, serving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels">Celestial Hebdomad</a>. They vary greatly in appearance, from the human-looking Sword and Trumpet Archons, to animalistic Hound and Owl Archons, to the more abstract Lantern Archon.
</li><li> Eladrins are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> celestials from the Olympian Glades of Arborea, serving Queen Morwel and the Court of Stars, essentially a good version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>. They tend to look like supernatural elves - firre eladrin have fiery eyes, and shiradi eladrin have wings, for example - but can freely assume more fantastical forms like a pillar of flame or cloud of light shards.
</li><li> Guardinals are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a> celestials from the Blessed Fields of Elysium, serving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfBeasts">Talisad</a> and the Five Companions, who are more or less an epic-level adventuring party. Their ranks are made up of heavenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMen">Beast Men</a> - leonals, lupinals, equinals, ursinals, and so on.
</li><li> Other celestial beings include devas, angels assigned to monitor and patrol specific planes, lillends, winged snake-women who defend art and unspoiled wilderness, bariaurs, ram-centaurs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Ysgard</a>, hollyphants, which can shift between the forms of a small, winged elephant and a winged mastodon, and moon dogs, intelligent hounds with a potent array of abilities to combat evil, dispell illusions, and heal wounds.
</li></ul></li><li> Fourth Edition mixed things up by declaring angels to be "expressions of the Astral Sea," basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> who mostly act as servants and mercenaries for the gods on their own initiative according to their individual natures. They're depicted as glowy, winged, legless humanoids and can now be of any alignment, so yes, evil gods have their own angels. The term "archon" was reassigned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elementalembodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elementalembodiment">elemental</a> servants of the Primordials, while eladrins became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elven subrace</a> emphasizing their connection to the Feywild.
</li><li> Fifth Edition has had little in the way of celestials in its beastiaries thus far, with only the standard deva, solar and planetar appearing under a generic "Angel" entry. Eladrins remain a fey elven subrace, while the 4th Edition elemental archons have been renamed "elemental myrmidons." And player paladins who reach 20th level can temporary take up an angelic form as part of their Oath of Vengeance.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a German RPG named <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_(role-playing_game)">Engel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (Angel) where you play... angels.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em> has no less than seven major types of Angels (called "choirs"), and two minor types. Some of these are practically humans with superpowers, while others are so alien that they consider the "human condition" something akin to a disease. They can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">banished from Heaven</a> if they act in defiance of their various natures, and will fall to become demons if they continue to do so as Outcasts. (An angel can also choose at any time to fall and become a demon- most don't.) While Outcasts can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionQuest">redeem themselves</a> once they have healed the damage caused by their acts, its significantly harder for demons to ascend- but not impossible. The seven main types (from highest to lowest rank) are:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">Seraphim</a>: Serpents with six eyes and six feathered wings.

</li><li> The Harbinger of Menoth is a more classical take on the angel, albeit wingless since she is human; basically, Menoth's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Chosen One</a>.

<ul><li> The Living Saints are chosen vessels of the God-Emperor's might and meet all of the criteria for being angels. However, <em>these</em> angels are known for wielding flaming chainsaw-swords and declaring they will <em>purge</em> the land... monumental ass-kicking tends to ensue whenever one shows up. Except the whole "chosen of the Emperor" could easily just be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">misunderstood</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> and warp powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">derived from the belief</a> of the rather zealous SoB.
</li><li> Funnily enough, the ones actually referred to as angels are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">a million-strong army of 8 feet tall, fanatical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">super soldiers</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Witchcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Witchcraft">Witchcraft</a></em> and its sequel game <em>Armageddon</em>, angels mostly conform to common beliefs as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a>, both in their native plane (where they are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a>) and our world (where they have to incarnate themselves into physical bodies, but can easily hide their true natures). Both heavenly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">fallen angels</a> (the latter and demons being one and the same) are split into two orders: the more powerful ones, created/born as angels (Seraphim) and the souls of mortals that went to Heaven or Hell which were transfigured into angelic forms (Cherubim and Qlippothim, respectively) to be field agents and footsoldiers.
</li><li> The "angels" (if they can still be called that; they sure think they can) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">Demon: The Fallen</a></em> are split up into seven celestial Houses, based on which day of creation they had a role in (for instance, the Rabisu, responsible for the sixth day and all the creatures of the Earth, have control over animal life, plant life, and flesh). As the Quotes page indicates, the pre-Fall angels were quantum beings that existed in multiple states — the actual debate that led to the Fall is described by one angel as simultaneously being a verbal debate <em>and</em> clashing elements of a symphony <em>and</em> a struggle between elemental forces. Actual angels have disappeared from Creation by the time the game begins, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">as has God</a>. Perhaps Angels aren't as gone as you might think, depending on your Storyteller. One sidebar (and thus optional) in the final book gives stats for genuine blessed-by-God angels: a slight alteration from the standard Demon stats for thematic reasons, with the ass-kicking stats pegged at eleven. There is also a suggestion in one novel that the avatars of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">mages</a> are the remains of the angels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>:
<ul><li> The core NWoD has an update called The God-Machine Chronicle, with new rules and an entire chronicle that focuses on the titular God-Machine. One aspect of this details the Angels that serve the God-Machine: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">Divine subroutines and programs running on its cosmic supercomputer</a>. This will also be heavily relevant in the next NWoD game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">Demon: The Descent</a></em>, where Angels seem to feature as the antagonists according to posts from the developers. What's been revealed thus far indicates that angels have no free will outside their orders (going against them, even in letter, causes them to fall and become demons), act as forces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays">pushing things towards some arrayed purpose they can't possibly know</a>, take any number of forms corporeal and non-corporeal, and are sometimes set at cross purposes (one Actual Play has one angel assigned to protect a barista, another assigned to <em>kill</em> said barista, and both falling because of it). A playtest also features one who parleys with a demon to track down a badly damaged, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> angel who turns out to be trying to follow the Machine's orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em> features the <em>qashmallim</em>. Despite the fact that the books make it very clear that they are <em>not</em> angels, they can take any number of forms (including Biblical-style renditions such as a man with four faces or a flaming chariot), they have powers that are Biblical in scope (such as calling down a rain of fire or turning a human into a pillar of salt), and they're made of the "Divine Fire" that powers the universe and act in service of a guiding force known as "the Principle." Just to be confusing, the books <em>also</em> make it very clear in some points that they <em>are</em> angels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Sometimes in the same sentence</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> has Angels as being the inhabitants of the Supernal Realm of the Aether (where the Arcana of Forces and Prime originate) and are divided into the choirs of Seraphim (for Forces) and Cherubim (for Prime). The Seraphim are described as being powerful and furious, often manifesting in forms of wild, powerful energy, while the Cherubim are more patient and wise, often manifesting in gentler, softer forms. All angels are said to be forces of righteousness with high moral standards, although their <em>particular</em> view of morality can be sometimes a bit alien. The sample Cherubim are the Ophan (a nude, feminine figure, completely white and hairless and covered in hundreds of closed eyes which blaze with a blinding, blue light when open) and the Beast Keeper (a multi-armed, solidly-built masculine figure who has constantly shifting animal features). The sample Seraphim are the Metatron (described as a towering humanoid being of pure fire with countless wings constantly folding and unfolding behind it and constant electricity sparkling around it) and the Elemental (a being which can manifest as a pillar of fire, a ball of heat and light, a beast constructed from magma, or a swirling torrent of water). The other suggested angels have forms ranging from the typical (humanoid beings made from energy, burning bushes) to the unusual (a rubber ball constantly ricocheting off of surfaces, a structure made from marble and glass suspended in orbit) to the particularly alien (which greatly resemble the Angels from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Evangelion</a></em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> has the Nemeses, assassins serving Fate who kill anyone who tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and manifest as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> resembling their target. They're never explicitly called angels but the parallels are obvious.

A first for the Souls Series, it looks positively angelic with a bright white appearance, four arms, two wings, and a face shrouded by a white hood. Despite its holy appearance it uses Dark Sorcery, a type of magic based upon consuming souls to empower itself. Defeating it (which requires a perfect run through not only the toughest area in the game, but Darklurker can easily one shot most builds with any of its attacks) rewards you its soul, which downright states that whatever the Darklurker is, it shouldn't exist. And while it is found in the Abyss and wields Dark Sorcery it is <em>not</em> a creature of the Dark since its soul is a <strong>light</strong> soul — which only adds to the wrongness.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a>,</em> they turn out to be extremely hostile beings that shriek loudly and endlessly barrage you with beams of light whenever they spot you.

<ul><li> Their most notable variation is that instead of feathered wings, they have tendrils of light extending from their backs. They wear armor and cloaks and their faces (which are actually just harmonic resonances) are always in shadow. One novel adaptation of the series claims that they are not physical, but more made up of light and sound. Personality wise, the series generally portrays them with shades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>. They are more into order than good, and they care little for humans except as a tool to fight demons, with a couple of exceptions being introduced so far.

Tyrael (Justice), the good angel of <em>Diablo 2</em>, only turned to humanity's side after watching a particular human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">blow himself up to save the world</a>. The other two angels sided with him, opting to wait and observe how humans would develop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> reveals the other two Archangels who sided with humanity: Auriel (Hope), and Itherael (Fate). Both are pretty nice to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Nephalem</a>, but by that point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Heavens are burning, the angels' doom is written in prophecy, and you're pretty much their <em>only hope</em></span>. Tyrael was the first to see the value of humans, and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">became one</span> when he became fed up with the Council's inaction.
</li><li> Mankind itself (originally called Nephalem) was created by the union of rebel demons and angels; the rebel leaders, Lilith and Inarius, saw the humans as soldiers and slaves/worshippers respectively, even though the humans had the potential power to defy fate and surpass both the angels and demons (which is why the Angiris Council considered wiping them out).
</li><li> Inarius also used the Worldstone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">block</a> the godlike Nephalem powers every human inherited from their supernatural parents, which would theoretically make humans more powerful than angels and demons combined. Yes, the Worldstone you've been <em>protecting</em> during <em>Diablo 2</em>. The one that was said (by heavenly voices) to cause Armageddon if it were ever destroyed so the barbarian tribes dedicated their entire society to guarding it for eternity. The few humans who did learn of their heritage had their minds wiped by the Angiris Council. And that's why you still had to hack away at lightning enchanted gloams with a cracked sword instead of wishing them out of existence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> seems to be playing up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> nature of the franchise for all it's worth.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>, a cinematic reveals that angels don't have faces shrouded in shadow...<em>they don't have heads</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyrael</span> actually <em>grows</em> a head when he falls.
</li><li> One of the signs that Imperius isn't as friendly as Tyrael is that Imperius' wings seem to be made of <em>fire</em> instead of light.

Even the least of angels can obliterate an unprepared adventurer, and archangels are, bar none, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">the most powerful singular physical beings in the base game</a>. Appearances vary, being randomly generated, but they will reflect their gods' spheres. This can lead angels of darker deities of, say, nightmares or death, to look more demonic than actual demons.

The closest to "angels" would be the lesser Aedra. The Aedra, meaning "Our Ancestors" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalTongue">old Aldmeri language</a>, are the pre-creation beings who sacrificed a large portion of their divine power in order to create Mundus, the mortal world. They were originally many in number, but only 8 of the most powerful survived the creation of Mundus. (And depending on the story, even they did not truly "survive," but they are dead and "dreaming they are alive.")

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragons</a>, servants/fragments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine">Akatosh</a>, the draconic god of time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">chief deity</a> of the Divines pantheon, are another. These beings are typically considered by many in-universe to be the equivalent of angelic beings. Dragons in particular play with the morality aspects of the trope, being creatures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDemonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDemonic">aggression and domination</a>, and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">in their blood to be cruel and contemptuous</a>. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">they can fight against their baser nature</a>, as best exemplified by Paarthurnax.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallFromHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallFromHeaven">Fall from Heaven</a></em> mod for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> IV</em>, the higher angels like to call themselves gods and interfere in mortal affairs. Several other angels are mentioned, and some are actually faction leaders. Cassiel falls from grace for hating that the others are messing with mortals. He comes down to Erebus and forms his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> faction, the Grigori, who reject the "gods." Cassiel's appearance is that of a sickly-pale man. On the other hand, the Bannor Empire is partly ruled by an angel named Sabathiel, who still serves the "gods." His appearance is that of an attractive winged man in gleaming gold armor. Then there's a whole faction of angels called Mercurians, which was cast down after its leader Basium rejected the Compact (an agreement that limited interfering in mortal affairs) in favor of a direct war with the demons. Basium is merciless to anyone worshiping demons or practicing demonic magic. The Mercurians themselves are so vicious that many mortals simply assume they are another sort of demon. Basium looks like a grey-skinned bodybuilder overdosed on steroids.

She then becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. This seems to correspond with the wing motifs used on the Sorceresses in this game as Rinoa's angelic wings contrast against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Ultimecia's black wings. According to the game's history, all Sorceress received their powers from their creator the Great Hyne which would technically make them angels.

Her appearance is that of an angel with blue skin, six golden wings and a cannon under her skirt. She apparently led the other Espers in rebellion against the Occuria and was sealed away in Giruvegan. Before her rebellion, she was said to have a divine light which faded forever after she was cast out.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Angels have been the traditional ultimate unit of the Human factions of the series since the third game. Their upgrade, the Archangel, boasts impressive speed, toughness, attack power, and the ability to resurrect troops once per battle. In the fifth game, angels and archangels are female and wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">humongous swords</a>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> alternate upgrade, the Seraph, wears red clothing, has <em>blood-stained wings</em>, and ditches resurrection in favor of calling down the wrath of <strike> God</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Elrath (Dragon of Light)</a> on enemies.
</li><li> Angels first appear in the 2nd scenario of the first campaign of the third game. A little town called Fair Feather, otherwise completely undeveloped, had so far resisted Kreegan invasion attempts thanks to the one thing it <em>does</em> have: a Portal of Glory (the Angel summoning building). After getting control of Fair Feather (which can happen in the first two turns), the scenario becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp War</a> in your favor.
</li><li> It can assumed that the Angels of the pre-HOMMV games (including just plain <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em>) were... not all that supernatural that they might appear: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that if you thought the Devils were bad, you'd find the truth of the Angels even worse — and those Devils are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invaders</a> (though this doesn't mean the angels were <em>evil</em> — the context points more to 'worse if you dislike the sci-fi elements of the franchise' rather than a judgement on the Angels' morality). In 2019, a former developer finally revealed what exactly the Angels were: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> self-aware hunter-killer androids the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Ancients</a> designed to hunt Kreegan and released across the galaxy</span>. That's why they first show up in the third game and the description in their introduction mentions angels were almost never seen before — the Kreegan only arrived on the planet in-between the second and third games.
<ul><li> In fact, Angels of HOMMV-VII are a lot worse - games themselves and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> all but outright stated that they are "merely" a dying race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a> usually ruled by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>. While they do have wings, light-aligned magic powers and endless (unless killed) lives, it's just their racial traits. They originally aligned with Humans only because at the time the latter was the only race gullible enough to be converted into Elrath worship and to believe Angels to be his messengers and the former really needed a place to hide. In a few centuries when they de facto ruled human Empire they introduced such lovely things as inquisition and crusades, tried to use souls and bodies of dead people to resurrect their own dead brethren and wished to start a world-scale genocidal war out of hatred to people who screwed their plans (and saved the world by doing that) thousands years ago. Oh, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppearanceIsInTheEyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppearanceIsInTheEyeOfTheBeholder">their beautiful looks is an illusion that changes depending on the viewer - an elf will see a winged elf for example</a>. There is no information about their true form other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that their reproduction is completely different compared to any other race and that they cannot be mixing with anyone (at least their males doesn't even have necessary parts).

Their angels are basically really tall humans, no wings and no emotions, and live underground because they can't enter sunlight or they'll die. It's implied that they're descended from the inhabitants of Mu who fled the island in the same way that the protagonists did previously.

Later games added to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a> influences, but he is still referred to as an angel by other characters.

The end of the story shows that the idea she was crucial to his plans was another false impression, she's completely disposable, and in fact, mass-produced</span>. In the second game the sprite is reused as generic ranged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> called succubus (and variations thereof).

Of note: Virtues are creatures composed of blue light with a shimmering crimson heart; Thrones are rather evil-looking, gray-skinned and black-robed humanoids with no wings, but bound to an eternally-spinning flaming wheel; the Cherubs have at least once been seen as a robotic four-headed (a human head, a bull one, an eagle one, and a lion one) monstrosity; the Trumpeter from the Apocalypse is a winged <em>skeleton</em>.

In other games, he has four faces; two on his head, one on his torso, and one on the staff he wields.
</li><li> Lucifer (yes, that one) has several forms: an impossibly beautiful, six-winged human with horns, or a towering abomination with midnight-blue skin, fangs, talons, bat wings and barely humanoid look, or a small boy, or a wheelchair-bound older gentleman, or a woman... And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Kazuma Kaneko</a> says we still haven't seen his true form, a fusion of all his other forms.

Also, Satan is on the side of Law, while Lucifer's Chaos.

<ul><li> The game has Angels that are, well, mysterious, to say the least... their nature and hand in events are only really gone into in the postgame content. Even then, all but the "lowest tier" is described to be completely incomprehensible and non-physical to humanity. Angels are even higher-up than the Composer, impossible for him to even see unless they downtune themselves to his frequency. Remember that the Composer is treated as God by everyone in the UG.
</li><li> The only Angel seen in the game itself, rather than just hinted at by the Secret Reports, is the writer of the Secret Reports himself, and the only Angel to have any hand in the Game itself, known officially as the Producer. His job is to assist the Composer, though he is forbidden by angelic law from actively interfering in the events of the Game itself. He is also the only Angel known to the Composer, and one of only two people who are supposed to know the Composer's identity. His true identity, given to us by these postgame reports, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sanae Hanekoma, AKA: CAT.

<ul><li> Arguably, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Naaru</a>. They look a bit like a winged, haloed man made out of geometric shapes. Their abilities seem to be limited to giving mortal races the powers of Paladins, and they seem quite unconcerned about who gets it. As for the unconcern, it turns out in the resolution of the <em>Burning Crusade</em> storyline that they are using the Blood Elves as part of a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to lure and destroy Kil'jaeden. As opposed to the uncaring, unchanging Titans, the Naaru are portrayed as unambiguously Good, albeit somewhat aloof.
</li><li> And under certain conditions, they turn into void creatures: beings of shadow and darkness that may or may not remain sane and/or good. They automatically absorb dead spirits that stray too close to them. Sometimes they manage to change back, sometimes not. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the void transformation is extremely rare and a cause of great sadness among other Naaru.
</li><li> There are also the spirit healers who have the traditional winged female human appearance (though they are translucent, invisible to living characters, and roughly double the size of the largest playable races). When a player character dies, they will materialize in spirit form at the nearest spirit healer and be given the option to either be resurrected by her (with a significant hit to their equipment's durability and an unremovable debuff that reduces all their stats by 75% for 10 minutes) or travel back to the location of their body.
</li><li> Players of the priest class who are specced in the Holy tree have an ability that allows them to automatically assume the form of a spirit healer for 15 seconds upon their own death to keep healing their allies. Since spirit healers have a generically female appearance, a male priest who is using a gender-specific title will see his title change to the female equivalent during the 15 seconds that he is in spirit healer form.

<ul><li> Regular angels seem to be relatively normal people, if immortal and supernaturally empowered. The series has so far given us two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a> angels, plus one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">atoning</a> for the (unauthorized) destruction of a city, one whose behavior is more representative of a succubus, and a total drunk who got kicked out of heaven for being stoned. Former associates of the atoner are either worse or much, much worse. It's no wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">God has abandoned them</a>. They are all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> variety but can hide their wings to blend in with humans. They also have pointy ears like those of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elf</a>, but people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">usually</a> can't see them. They're also all white-haired. We also find out how angels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">come to exist</a>.
</li><li> Later comics introduced a Cherubim ("Always plural... they're gestalt beings with four aspects."), which apparently did not go along with the plan to turn Heaven into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">Celestial Bureaucracy</a> and got exiled for it. Rumisiel describes them as pure, raw power times four, and the one we've seen perpetually had a cat on his shoulder while pretending to be human, then when revealing his true nature, an eagle and an ox appeared as well, all apparently part of the same being (a reference to the Biblical description of what are believed to be Cherubim given in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Book of Ezekiel</a>, as beings with four faces: a man's, a lion's, an eagle's, and an ox's).
</li><li> Seraphim have also been mentioned, though none have appeared in the story. Rumisiel describes them as beings of pure flame with six wings, and even more powerful than a Cherubim. When he talked to Vashiel about a Cherubim appearing on Earth, the one thing they instantly agreed on was "Could be worse. Could be a Seraph."

They have feathered wings and a proficiency with light magic as opposed to the Demons' bat wings and talent for dark magic. Angels aren't a strictly "good" race either; they value power and influence as much as the greediest demon (though there are undoubtedly individual exceptions). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh, and they're also slowly dying out for some reason.</span>

Angels serve the will of God and are pretty big assholes.
<ul><li> Their asshole qualities are justifiable. In the story, God has a plan for everything in the universe, except for K (the main character). K screws up The Plan.

In the former setting, Eridan immediately starts shooting them upon arrival, and they are hostile to everyone for the rest of the game. He's justified in trying to kill them, though: Troll mythology describes angels as demons with feathery wings and <em>bringers of the apocalypse</em>.
</li><li> Then again, due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being manipulated by Doc Scratch</span>, Troll civilization is completely based on values Humans would consider (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">kind of</a>) evil, and has an inverted worldview (especially when it comes to light/dark symbolism), it would make sense that what Humans see as the archetype of good, Trolls would see as evil.
</li><li> Under this definition <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack Noir</span> can be considered an angel too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is part of Eridan's rationale when he loses hope and decides to join Jack: after all, if just killing regular angels is so hard what chance does he have against a lord of angels?</span>

Heaven accepts souls from every planet in the universe, so angels are mostly aliens united only in ownership of wings and a halo. They can be temporarily banished for committing crimes against Heaven (fallen angels), or leave entirely and become known as devils. There are also cherubim, which are native to heaven, have no souls, and were created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Mikael</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>.

There are all sorts of rules governing the angels' behavior. For example, they can't ask for help from "creatures of darkness" (or anyone connected to such beings). Angels are sexless, featureless, glowing humanoids with wings and a thin layer of paint/glamour that makes their skin, clothes, and feathers. Damage will strip this layer and it takes a couple of seconds for it to regenerate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillSixBillionDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillSixBillionDemons">Kill Six Billion Demons</a></em> involves the adventures of an Earth woman with an angel from another realm called the Throne, a hole-ridden, statuesque being whose name translates as <em>82 White Chain Born in Emptiness Returns to Subdue Evil</em>.
<ul><li> The form an Angel wears in most situations is actually a shell that houses their true body, which the author has likened to a controlled nuclear explosion. Angels are immortal but not unkillable; if slain through superior force, they reincarnate in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds">Void Between the Worlds</a>, where they appear in their true form—only sometimes humanoid, and always including numerous wings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesDoNotBelongThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesDoNotBelongThere">eyes in odd places</a>. At least one angel is a free-floating Euclidean solid with a halo. The number in front of their name actually indicates how many times they have incarnated.
</li><li> In general, angels are sterile, unchanging and sexless beings. They do not change or beget and view things like fertility, mutability, and gender as mortal failings. (In theory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">In practice, a lot of angels openly refer to themselves and each other with male pronouns</a>). Angels like 82 White Chain who spend extended periods in contact with — and caring about — humanity are known to become more humanlike, which includes developing gender (in 82's case, she's becoming female). This is not portrayed as necessarily a bad thing.
</li><li> Also, angels were created specifically to be Heaven's law enforcement. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">Divine Intervention</a> here: to subdue evildoers, angels employ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts">Supernatural Martial Arts</a> honed by uncounted eons' worth of experience.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PerfectionEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PerfectionEngine">Perfection Engine</a></em> revolves around an angelic race called Eidolons that live in a society run by their perfect morals and order. Additionally, all of them appear to have a halo above their head, and wings are prevalent symbols in their society.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAntithesis">The Antithesis</a></em>, angels are a species classified as 'Archaeans' (winged, humanoids residing on a planet called The Atrium) and are ruled by Commander Yahweh Telei, who is surprisingly an adolescent prodigy and genetic engineer, suffering from cognitive disorders closely resembling O.C.D. and Asperger's. Angelic society revolves around high science and technology.
</li><li> Considering that the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar">The Salvation War</a></em> is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">Rage Against the Heavens</a> (and Hell in the first book), angels are the official enemies of humans in that universe. They fit the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> model and serve Yahweh, who's shown to be a colossal and self-conceited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>. It's implied that they use the humans in Heaven as power leechers or something similar and that their power is dependent on organized singing in some way. Of particular note is Michael, the military commander who has his own ulterior motives regarding the war against humanity, and Uriel, a powerful angel who has the ability to induce living creatures to simply drop dead (though his effectiveness on humans has diminished noticeably over time). Oh, and angels aren't invulnerable; they can be gunned down or blown up for a veritable shower of white and silver blood. Six-winged Seraphim appear, although they turn out not to be actual Angels. They were one of the many species Yahweh has conquered, kept around essentially as songbirds.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HitherbyDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HitherbyDragons">Hitherby Dragons</a></em>, angels are gods (supernatural beings) that answer emptiness with hope and wear jackets with holes cut out for their wings. They have various powers and are often the result of a person making a promise an ordinary human can't fulfill. Evasive A can grant wishes if the person catches her (but she's uncatchable), Magic A has a non-zero chance of accomplishing anything, Realistic A can provide a pragmatic assessment of the situation and it's best not to think about Forbidden A.

She looks like a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a>, but she's able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheBonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheBonds">break iron chains,</a> summon up a flaming sword out of nowhere, and teleport away seemingly at will. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHalo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHalo">Her body shines,</a> how brightly seems to depend on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">how much she's using her power.</a> She's later described as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">a few inches above six feet and incredibly beautiful,</a> although that's apparently rather petite for a Celestial. She's noticeably less snarky than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark">most of the other characters</a>, and she has some unspecified healing powers. She works as a Celestial Paladin, which is apparently more of a cop or agent of some sort than the D&amp;D idea of paladin-as-holy-knight, though she does have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse">Celestial horse</a>. (Who does <em>not</em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus">Pegasus-wings</a>, much to Paul's surprise.) Paul thinks she's the most beautiful woman she's ever met, though he tries hard to keep his lust for her from showing because he knows they really aren't very compatible, personality-wise, what with her being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> paladin and him being a magic-breaking thief-for-hire.
</li><li> Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">the ice between them begins to thaw a little,</a> they both begin to talk a bit more freely to each other. She seems to be rather sensitive about her wings, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">physics aren't on her side</a> and the local ambient magic isn't strong enough for her to fly without a great deal of difficulty, and they make her feel clumsy and unbalanced. When she complains that they're more of a bother than they're worth at times, Paul responds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakinessShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakinessShame">predictably,</a> followed immediately by a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidIJustSayThatOutLoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidIJustSayThatOutLoud">Did I Just Say That Out Loud?</a> moment.
