<ul><li> Negi Springfield of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> seems to fit this trope pretty well, much to the pain of his friends and family. Sure, he's only ten years old but that doesn't mean few injuries will stop him. Impale him on a stone spear? He'll just use it to bash you in the head with. Cut off his right arm? In his own words "I still have my left!". And you manage to leave a massive hole in his gut, doing so much damage to the rest of the body that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfBlood">causes blood to pour from his eye sockets</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">causes him to vomit a pint or two of blood</a>? Eh, you're still not gonna win.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em>, Lt Burning uses his cane to shatter the cast on his leg so he can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Hero</a> and save the Gundam in battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> does this a lot. Rock Lee, too, from the same show.
<ul><li> Naruto is justified in doing it most of the time though, considering he heals from injuries far faster than anyone else, and the doctors are holding him back just to be safe, which is usually just an excuse to have him be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for a few episodes.
</li><li> Used twice by Hinata in the Three-Tails filler arc. The first time, she gets injured fighting Nurari, and after she tells Kakashi she can still move, Kakashi says the mission is still in effect. Two episodes later, after surviving being crystallized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain">Guren</a>, Sakura suggests that she shouldn't force herself just yet, and has her stay behind until she recovers.
</li><li> Special credit has to go to Onoki, who gets hit by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a fucking <em>meteor</em></span> and still insists on fighting. Bonus points for Onoki already being an old man with a bad back <em>before</em> the injury.
</li></ul></li><li> Ryu in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>.
</li><li> Likewise Lockon Stratos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> refuses treatment which will take three weeks instead going out to fight despite being blind in his right eye, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it gets him killed</span>.
</li><li> Scar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> absolutely <em>refuses</em> to stay in the refugee camp for Ishvalans, despite the fact that he might not even be able to walk properly at any one point he's there. In his defense, he's also trying to protect them from being punished for harboring him.
<ul><li> Also, Edward Elric insists on automail surgery so that he can join the state military only <em>days</em> after losing two of his limbs. It takes a year for him to actually recover and join though (regular automail surgery and therapy would require three years).
</li><li> There's also Izumi, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormallyIWouldBeDeadNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormallyIWouldBeDeadNow">missing nearly half her internal organs</a> and frequently coughs up blood due to that fact, and continues to fight despite it. A couple of characters, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Winry Rockbell</a> have commented on this, Winry in particular stressing the need for her to go to a hospital that could take better care of her. Of course, a hospital can't do much for the fact <em>that she's downright <strong>missing</strong> several of her organs.</em>
</li><li> Then there's Lan Fan, who, despite not having a left arm anymore and severely weakened, still wants to go back and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">"protect the young lord."</a> Doctor Knox manages to talk her out of it, though.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://mangafox.me/manga/fullmetal_alchemist/v24/c097/41.html">Said word by word by Captain Buccaneer even after he got one of his arms scrapped the hell out of him.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Oliver Armstrong is pissed when Greed makes her stay behind because of her broken arm.
</li><li> Last, but definitely not least... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colonel Roy Mustang keeps on fighting even when he is <em>blind.</em></span>
</li></ul></li><li> Faust VIII from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> regularly does excruciatingly painful things to himself that no sane doctor would do. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">Love Makes You Crazy</a>... It might also be justified in that he's implied to be a morphine addict. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>: "When Yoh broke his leg during their fight. Faust tore the broken bone right out of his leg and had Eliza bring him another similar in size, reasoning that replacing the broken bone was faster than letting it heal."
<ul><li> When he and the other candidates are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">dropped from a great height</a>, it is assumed they will use their powers to land safely. Faust? He does nothing. He reasons the morphine he is constantly hopped up on will leave him conscious after landing, and then he can use Eliza (who is a trained nurse) as his hands to stitch himself together afterwards. Basically, Faust VIII treats his <em>own body</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has this a lot, especially with, Ichigo, who just never seems to sit still when injured.
<ul><li> Ganju's fist says "No, no you can't."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>
<ul><li> Nanoha and Vita's injuries at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em> were revealed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplementary materials</a> to both be serious enough that the doctors told them to take things easy from now on and that they'll need to go through some rehabilitation, especially Nanoha, whose overuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Blaster System</a> had taken enough of a toll on her that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel">Magic Levels</a> had gone down by 10%. Naturally, the both of them were the first ones to return to service on the aftermath of the incident, filling their schedules with many strenuous tasks like nothing happened.
</li><li> Also before the final battle of the third season, Zafira and Vice. Especially Zafira, who fights despite being covered in bandages, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">managing to capture Otto</span> with Shamal, finally turning the tide of the battle against the Numbers.
</li><li> And before either of these, in the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">A's</a></em>, Raising Heart, badly damaged, assures Nanoha it can be fired. "It's alright."
<div class="indent"><strong>Raising Heart:</strong> I can be shot.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce">Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureMagicBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureMagicBeing">Signum</a> getting slashed multiple times and getting stabbed through the spine by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> weapon. After surviving that, she takes a few months of rest to recover then goes back to service as soon as she can despite the complaints of Agito.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "My bones and guts are still inside me. I can't stay put any longer in this situation".
</div></li><li> Although a football game isn't as life-or-death as some of the other examples, Hiruma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> returns to the game (over Mamori's objections) after Gaoh breaks his throwing arm. He makes his re-entrance more dramatic by using ketchup to make his face look like a bloody mess.
<ul><li> The title character also chooses to stay in the game after hitting 40 yards in 4.2 seconds in the Bando match, not wanting to miss out on their victory (or failure, as it had been last time after hitting 4.2.).
</li></ul></li><li> During the Team Masho fight during the Dark Tournament arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, Team Urameshi only has three usable fighters: Kurama, Yusuke, and a brutally-injured Kuwabara. (One of the corrupt rules board members has tricked their other two fighters into being unavailable.) The first two are taken out (Kurama with grievous injuries and Yusuke by a rules loophole). Masho has one fighter left... so Kuwabara forces himself into the ring to avoid the team being disqualified, even though he can't use his spirit energy due to his injuries. He wins thanks to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">timely encouragement from his love interest</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has had this tons of times with just about every seriously-taken character. Zoro is famous for this, though more or less because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a> as Zoro has been sliced and diced and is able to fight later. In one instance, Zoro had been severely cut down the chest and had very little medical help. Despite this, he was able to fight an octopus-man using six swords.
<ul><li> Brook, having already been heavily injured from his fight with Ryuuma, is sent away due to his injuries, and is absent from much of the early battle with Oz. He returns with salt to help the Straw Hats, claiming to have recovered by drinking milk. However, as he doubles over in pain, it's clear that he hasn't fully healed yet.
</li><li> Wiper continues to fight in the Survival Game despite severe injuries, and manages to somehow survive using the extremely powerful Reject Dial three times in one day.
</li><li> Luffy is defined by this trope. He <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beats Crocodile after dying twice, beats the embodiment of lightning with, literally, a ton of gold fused to his hand, and he climbs up a thousand feet of mountain carrying one person on his back and one person in his <em>teeth</em> after fighting bear sized rabbits.</span> Talk about never surrender.

He later joins those defending the garrison when it is breached by multiple attackers despite being ordered to limit himself to giving orders due to his injury, though he does wait until a good portion of the knights are down to enter the fight openly and he was furious at being given the order in the first place.
</li><li> In episode 49 of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Beyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Beyblade">Beyblade</a></em> Ray is directly attacked by Bryan's bit-beast Falborg's wind attacks. After winning the second match and tying the score, Ray blacks out. His teammates worry about him and try to talk him out of going back out there for the third match, but Ray doesn't listen. Ray is almost killed during the third match, but his bit-beast Driger saves him and Ray manages to win the battle.
</li><li> Toudou during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>'s finale insists this, but Chiba stops him. He actually does this twice in the same battle. After having a mountain explode under him he still kept trying to fight in his sparking crippled personal mecha until he was shot down and then after being recovered and half treated he brushes off further medical aid and tries to get back into the fight in a mook mecha. However he passes out from his injuries before he's even able to get into the cockpit, proving Chiba correct.

At one point, he claims he's never felt more alive.
<ul><li> Incidentally, he 'broke in' by <em>driving an armored truck through the front wall</em>. Because the second Kira was killing aybody she saw try to enter from her vantage point outside the building.

There was that one time he was pulling off a rescue mission with one arm falling apart and his other hand broken in half while being continuously electrocuted. Allen asked the man he was rescuing to bite down on his broken hand so he could lift him because it couldn't function well enough to lift him on its own. The best example is probably when he gets thrown into a wall so hard it leaves a large crater and his resulting injuries are so severe he can't move anymore. He lets his sentient Innocence weapon take control of his body so he can still fight. Allen Walker. Is. Fantastic.

The Decepticons then took advantage of the huge decrease in Autobot fighting power by launching numerous raids simultaneously, since the remaining Autobots were either comparatively inexperienced or just lacked the overall strength and power to match the Decepticons. Despite their grievous wounds, both Star Saber and Blacker joined in the fighting against advice from the chief doctor. In both cases it was a disaster since Blacker was so badly hurt he couldn't even transform while the towering Star Saber in his weakened state just made him a bigger target and forced his fellow Autobots to focus their attention on protecting him. The reconstruction of the dying God Ginrai into Victory Leo gave the Autobots just enough fighting power to give Star Saber and Blacker the time they needed to properly recuperate.

<ul><li> This is a common phenomenon with soldiers in any war. They would rather be with their troops and fight than leave them. Whether their doctors allow them to do so is another matter.

However, by the very next episode, he's back at work doing exactly that, and overreacting to the point of paranoia at any tiny suggestion on his coworker's parts that he might not be ready to do so yet. Instead of taking the time to cope with his issues in a healthy way, he starts using Dilaudid, which, if it doesn't make his trauma go away, at least lets him forget about it long enough to kind-of-sort-of do his job.

Only after the match was ruled a no contest did The Sheik agree to go to the hospital and get his burns treated.
</li><li> After missing out on a title match against Fantasia and being regulated to managerial duty at the 2004 GLORY convention, Lexie Fyfe decided to defy doctors' orders when she saw then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> wrestler Desire was set to appear at Spinebuster Championship Wrestling and no opponent had been booked.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a> was't medically clear for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">ROH</a> The Final Showdown</em> on account of his broken ribs, but insisted on entering into a four way dance with Jack Evans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HunterJohnston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HunterJohnston">Delirious</a> and Ebetaroh anyway, saying that if any of them could pin him he'd give them the Pure Wrestling Title belt.

</li><li> Before <em>Supercard Of Honor VII</em>, Jay Briscoe received the first injury of his then thirteen year career after being gored by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rhyno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rhyno">Rhino</a> of SCUM. His doctor suggested Jay get surgery but Briscoe refused because that would mean he would miss the pay per view where he would be getting a title shot at SCUM leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Steen</a>. When the doctor said he'd have to miss the event whether he opted for surgery or not Jay just blew him off and went anyway...and won the belt, leading to SCUM's gradual decline. But before that happened, SCUM attacked Briscoe again after he defeated their new leader, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt Hardy</a>, injuring Jay's shoulder once again and forcing him to vacate the belt...or rather forcing matchmaker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness">Nigel McGuinness</a> to vacate the belt since Jay refused to stop defending it even with his arm in a sling.

</li><li> While listing the wrestlers not medically cleared for SHINE 24, Lexie Fyfe dryly noted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BlackRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BlackRose">La Rosa Negra</a> had been begging and pleading for another shot at Taylor Made, who gave her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">a brass knuckle beating</a> and didn't do worse only because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/IvelisseVelez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/IvelisseVelez">Ivelisse Vélez</a>, who was banned for other reasons.
</li><li> After SHINE 28, La Rosa Negra would demand a rematch, in text, after an assault on her throat from Malia Hosaka and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LeilaniKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LeilaniKai">Leilani Kai</a> left her unable to speak. On the same show, Velez returned from injury, possibly too soon, and had a fit when her title match vs Santana Garrett was ended due to referee stoppage, even though it was clear she <em>couldn't</em> fight at that point.
</li><li> After being being forced out of the ring due to a shoulder injury in 2016, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a> admitted that he had been getting advice to quit and rehab his shoulder before he'd be forced out by it and concluded this attitude was his biggest weakness.
</li><li> In October 2015, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness">Nigel McGuinness</a> removed Steve Corino from his commentary position for putting his hands on a wrestler, BJ Whimter, but understanding why, given Whitmer had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashed</a> Corino's son, reinstated him back on the active roster. This lead to Corino saying goodbye from ROH, since he had a doctor's note saying he could no longer wrestle. However, Whitmer was so persistent in his antagonism of Corino and his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlieBrownFromOuttaTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlieBrownFromOuttaTown">Mr. Wrestling III</a> throughout 2016, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo">even threatening to bring Corino's wife into the equation</a> that Corino ended up going against doctor's orders and vowing to be ready for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredContest">fight without honor</a> by July.
</li><li> Vélez herself became the poster girl for it in SHINE when she wasn't able to capitalize on a title shot she earned due to breaking her ankle at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground">Lucha Underground</a> event. About seven months later Vélez returned to SHINE with much fanfare to challenge reigning champion Santana Garrett... who retained when the referee stopped the match out of concern for Vélez's ankle. Ivelisse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">started building a Valkyrie like power stable</a> in retaliation to this "screw job" only to miss more SHINE shows when her ankle was broken again on another Lucha Underground event. Still, Vélez returned from injury much quicker, and seemingly much stronger than she had from the first, successfully winning the SHINE title...only to be forced to vacate it when her doctor disputed the notion Vélez was medically clear.

He led cavalry charges wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellBentForLeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellBentForLeather">leather jacket</a> instead.

</li><li> Nusaybah bint Kaab was a female warrior who fought in the armies of the Prophet Muhammad in the early days of Islam's expansion. During the battle of Uhud in the 7th century, she was nearly killed defending Muhammad. Lying near death the day after the battle, she heard the Prophet call for reinforcements and got up to answer to call, at which point she keeled over from blood loss. She eventually recovered.
</li><li> The sports world is full of this; especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>, where the ability to play through pain is considered to be a job requirement. One particularly famous example is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">San Francisco 49ers</a> safety Ronnie Lott, a player noted for hitting opponents so hard that he sometimes knocked himself out, was to be held inactive for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> due to a broken finger; he instead asked doctors to amputate it so that he could compete.
<ul><li> Another typical example: in one of the early Arena Football League championship games, a quarterback suffered a knee injury, and could be heard to say, "I heard it pop". Torn ligaments typically require surgery, and as much as a year and a half of rehabilitation, and many players report that the most difficult part of rehabilitation is the psychological aspect of learning to put trust in that damaged knee again. This player demanded to return to the game, and was effective, despite reinjuring the knee.
</li><li> Ben Roethlisberger is notably for regularly playing through various injuries. While usually relatively mild, most people wouldn't keep playing football with a broken foot, broken thumb, or separated AC joint in their throwing shoulder.
</li><li> Given that it's tackle football without the benefit of a face mask, rugby players will often get bloodied in the face, with things like bloody lips or broken noses, or just cut above the eyebrow and the like. Unless accompanied by a concussion, there's rarely an actual <em>injury</em> along with the cut. But, for sanitation's sake, they have to leave the field until the bleeding is stopped. So it's not uncommon to see a player with a face full of blood run off the field, only to run back on five minutes later, wrapped up in gauze and such.
<ul><li> The most famous instance of this in rugby was from Wayne Shelford, who, while playing for the New Zealand All Blacks against the French squad, <em>somehow</em> managed to get his scrotum torn open. He calmly asked the trainers to triage the mess as best they could, and returned to the match. Then subverted when he got knocked loopy enough from a shot to the head in that same match that they refused to let him continue and he was subbed out.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the boxing world, Smoking Joe Frazier EMBODIES this trope. The man would quite literally never stop coming forward giving him his nickname as he resembled a continuous train on its tracks. All of his losses either came from a decision or otherwise the fight was stopped. Hell, after being knocked down at lest seven times in two rounds, he STILL kept coming forward against Foreman and would have got up against Ali in the thriller in Manilla had it not been for his manager. Plus he had a cataract in one of his eyes meaning he fought many fights of his career partially blind. The man always could carrying on fighting and most likely would keep on doing so until he keeled over and died. Demonstrated here: <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/x9l_RrjjTMc">http://youtu.be/x9l_RrjjTMc<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart, two Delta Operators who fought and died during the Battle of Mogadishu. If anyone know's who I'm talking about, these TWO men single handedly heald of hordes of Somalis, killing 24 before they were overrun themselves... And to make it even more interesting, there's unofficially 1000 of equally well trained men like these two. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gordon">Just<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Shughart">Sayin'...<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li></ul></li><li> In Easy Company, of the 101st Airborne during World War II, if you didn't duck out of hospital as soon as you were able, the rest of the squad wouldn't be all that happy about having you back, figuring that you would rather spend time laid up than fighting alongside your fellow troopers. This was actually relatively common in World War II among injured troops, who would sneak out of the hospital in an attempt to get back to their units, as official Army policy was to assign them to the nearest shorthanded unit rather than their former group.
</li><li> Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. (yes, the son of <em>that</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>) suffered from arthritis (which forced him to walk with a cane) and heart disease, but that still didn't stop him from personally leading his troops ashore on Utah Beach at Normandy on D-Day, an action which won him the Congressional Medal of Honor. He died of a heart attack just over a month later on July 12, 1944. Badass runs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssFamily">in the family</a>.
</li><li> Before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrecoPersianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrecoPersianWars">climax of the Battle of Thermopylae</a>, two of the 300 Spartans named Eurytus and Aristodemus were allowed to go home after they were stricken by eye inflammations. Eurytus stayed even though he was practically blind, and died together with the rest of the 300. Aristodemus went home and was shunned by Spartan society for being a coward, and this only stopped when he also died in battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus">Herodotus</a> surmises that if only one had been sent home, or if both of them had left, the Spartans would not have considered it cowardice.
</li><li> The German 70th Infantry Division in WWII was known as "the stomach division", and was comprised of soldiers who had minor illnesses (such as stomach upset and diarrhea) which would not prevent them fighting should the need become desperate enough, as it did for Germany during the Battle of the Bulge.
</li><li> USS Yorktown (CV-5) was seriously damaged at the Battle of the Coral Sea in World War 2, to the point that the Japanese assumed she must have sunk. Upon Yorktown's return to Pearl Harbor, it was initially estimated that it would take two weeks to fully repair her. A mere <em>48 hours</em> later, she was underway again, patched up enough to lend needed support to a task force headed to reinforce Midway ahead of an impending Japanese attack.
