Similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay">Mistaken for Gay</a>, this is when a character is wrongly accused of cheating on his spouse or girlfriend because of a series of misinterpreted clues. Usually these clues look very suspicious (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FindingABraInYourCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FindingABraInYourCar">a bra left in his apartment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickMark">lipstick on his collar</a>, a piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffairHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffairHair">Affair Hair</a>, a romantic note) and the real story is hard to believe. The wrongly accused may protest "Wait! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanExplain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanExplain">I Can Explain</a>!" or "It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a>!" If the spouse or girlfriend is another major character, the conflict will be resolved; if the love interest is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a>, she may storm off, thus ending the relationship.

Other variants include the love interest discovering that the would-be boyfriend thief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeError">is actually a relative</a>, a member of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Incompatible Orientation</a>, or in rare cases, even the wrong gender.
</p><p>One notable property of this trope is that it can be used on shows that, because of their genre or their scrutiny by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, could never use a plot that involved actual adultery. But you can get some of the same benefits from a story where a character wrongly believes that adultery is going on.

She immediately assumes that they're in some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">illicit relationship</a>. Later the main characters go to his house for a study session (and to see why he didn't want to go home), and the two girls who like Akihisa immediately also start questioning him as to why there's women-related clothing and items in his apartment (which turns out to be his sister Akira's stuff, who's visiting him to make sure he's not goofing off).

<ul><li> It didn't help that, previous to their work at Technora, Fee and Dolf were coworkers at a small firm, and thus are still friendly to each other in private.
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> featured an instance of this in one episode — May's father Norman and the local Nurse Joy were actually setting up a fireworks display celebrating Norman and Caroline's anniversary.

A few examples:
<ul><li> Caught in bed with a girl snuggled up to him, both of them asleep (the girl slipped into his bed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavySleeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavySleeper">while he was asleep</a>).

It doesn't help his case that he had a long black hair on his clothes from Silva. In the game Power of Spirits, this is taken further when Meril, a girl Yoh had never met until this point, <em>walks in and hugs him.</em>

One part that does <em>not</em> follow this trope is the discovery of hickeys on Souichi's neck which Morinaga takes as solid proof, forgetting that he made them himself several days ago.

The creepy part is that, though Yuki would never harm Takatsuki, she is in her mid-twenties at youngest, and Takatsuki was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile">only eleven</a>...

In fact, Ruby had gotten pregnant through secretly visiting sperm donation clinics in an attempt to spare Jaunes feelings about his infertility, assuming that he didnt know about it, having secretly gotten him tested. Of course, some would argue that this is still cheating and not simply a gigantic misunderstanding since cheating can be argued to be wholly about the betrayal of trust and not the physical aspect at all.</span>

<ul><li> In the post-reveal fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Tendencies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Tendencies">Glaze</a></em>, Alya figures out from a few clues that Adrien and Chat Noir are one and the same, and her immediate reaction is to call him a lying cheating asshole for kissing Ladybug behind Marinette's back. It takes her a minute (and Marinette walking in, hearing her accusation and addressing Adrien as Chat) to realise that Marinette <em>is</em> Ladybug.
</li><li> The fic <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8063422">Odds Are That We Will Probably Be Alright<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, is set in a future where Marinette and Adrien have been dating since high school and are engaged to be married. However, both have become convinced the other is cheating on them, due to frequent suspicious disappearances and flimsy excuses, but neither of them can say anything to the other without risking their own secret, forcing them to confide in their respective best friends and their partners. When Nino and Alya get tired of their complaining, they force them to confront each other about it, leading to a heated argument where both become angry at the other's accusations. It gets to the point where Adrien decides to clear himself by admitting to being Chat Noir... but his wording — "I'm fucking Chat Noir, okay? That's why I have to leave." — predictably has the exact opposite effect, getting Marinette, Alya, and Nino furious at him until he transforms to show them the truth.
<div class="indent"><strong>Alya:</strong> I can't believe we had to spend months with you two thinking you were cheating on each other with each other. <br/><strong>Nino:</strong> Not with each other. Adrien did say he's been cheating on Marinette with himself.

Fearing that her friends' relationship is falling apart, Alya brings them together for an intervention. However, Adrien and Marinette manage to come up with the excuse that they had a bet about who could kiss their favourite superhero first — Marinette won, but she said that Adrien could go through with the kiss if he ever got the chance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alya almost buys it, only to instead start to suspect that her friends are Ladybug and Chat Noir.</span>

Alya comes to suspect something's going on with Nino and Marinette after overhearing and misinterpreting a conversation between keeping their superhero lives from her, leading her to break up with Nino right when he was about to propose. She figures out the truth before too long and they get back together. Earlier, the host of the Christmas Ball is akumatized because he believes his supermodel wife is unfaithful, having a lot of private meetings with other men, including Adrien. In reality, she was cancelling arrangements so that she could quit modeling and dedicate her time to their coming baby.

Alya is actually happy that Adrien spent the night with a girl instead of wallowing in memories of the long-dead Marinette... but goes absolutely berserk upon hearing a noise from upstairs, and realizing the two must have been <em>defiling</em> the late girl's bed. Of course, she later learns that Marinette is actually alive and was that very girl.

The woman in question would later reveal to Detective Rush that while she confessed her love for the husband, he remained faithful to his wife and family.
</li><li> In another episode, the detectives learn that a beautiful young black woman had visited the white murder victim at his office shortly before he was killed. His reaction toward her—looking very upset that she showed up, rushing her out of there—plus the revelation that he was sending money to her makes the detectives jump to the conclusion that she was his mistress. Only to have it turn out that she was his SISTER. He was passing for white and her appearance could have blown his cover.
</li><li> Subverted in "Forever Blue", where the detectives think that a murdered cop was having an affair with his partner's wife because a witness recalls overhearing a tearful argument between the two of them. When they confront the woman, she reveals that <em>she</em> wasn't having an affair with him—her <em>husband</em> was.

</li><li> An episode has a man seemingly framed for murder and on the run with a young woman who also ends up dead. The first "murder" turns out to be faked as part of a huge live-action role-playing game the man's brother was playing to get him out of a funk.

Later on, Lila (the sponsor) and Dexter do have sex, but only after Rita says that their relationship is over. Which apparently she didn't mean, because you know how women can be... so irrational when they think their perfect man is sleeping with another woman. Dexter then confesses to having sex with Lila. Sort of. When Rita asks him to tell her if Dexter had sex with Lila that night, Dexter replies "No... Not that night."

<ul><li> In one episode Fred's accidental discovery of a poem dedicated to Wilma, as well as Wilma's strangely secretive behavior, make Fred suspect that Wilma cheats on him. The catch is in the fact that the poem was actually written by Fred himself when he was still a high school student, while Wilma was secretive because she wanted to surprise Fred for his birthday. It doesn't help that a man calls wanting to talk to Wilma, and she acts strangely like she doesn't want Fred to hear. He becomes suspicious and goes to another phone, to hear her say, "...that's right, Darling, not the only man I ever loved, the only man I ever will love." Fred thinks he's about to lose Wilma to another man. It turns out he didn't get to hear the beginning of the conversation, where the man said to her before she responded, "This is the jeweler calling, on your husband's watch for his birthday, you want the engraving to read 'Darling...'" It was at that point Fred picked up the phone.
</li><li> In another episode, Wilma suspects Fred of cheating, though with better cause: He's coming home late from work, unusually tired, and when she follows him, she finds him in a romantic nightclub him with a very sexy blonde. The blonde is a charm school instructor, and Fred has been taking courses in dancing, small talk, and related matters so as to make their upcoming anniversary more special and memorable. That night was the final exam/dress rehearsal.

The woman was sure that the man was "sneaking this tart in for sex for his poor wife sleeps upstairs".
