A lot of the time, especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom">Sitcom</a>, the Inspirationally Disadvantaged person's reserves of strength are applied to doing some perfectly ordinary task such as competing in the school talent show, graduating, or going on a date. It's only elevated to the heights of heroism because the person doing it is "differently abled".
<p>Advocacy groups have spoken out against the practice, since it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">more than a little patronizing</a> to portray a disabled person as heroic for doing something the rest of us do all the time - comparable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace">You Are a Credit to Your Race</a>. That's one reason that this trope is a lot less common than it used to be, though a few shows that aren't afraid of a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">Glurge</a> still do it from time to time. It's also been noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">people seem to like to shower actors who portray these kind of characters with awards</a>, thus prompting more than a little cynicism about the motives of actors who take on these roles.
</p><p>The late Australian disability activist Stella Young referred to this as "inspiration porn," as it can be seen as a way of objectifying people with disabilities to make non-disabled individuals feel good. Her TED talk on the subject can be found here: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much">https://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Disparagingly known as the "super-crip" by disabled people, these are characters with disabilities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">shown as going above and beyond the level of even non-disabled people</a> in spite of their disabilities. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCSIEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCSIEffect">has led to the belief</a> that a wheelchair user <em>should</em> be training for the Paralympics or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple">Genius Cripple</a>, the mentally handicapped and blind should be practicing to be famous artists, and that having clinical depression should turn you into an awesome writer. In some cases, the character turns out to have a special talent or skill that no other character can beat, sometimes implicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">"making up" for the disability</a>, sometimes bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>. In certain cases the story goes out of its way to paint the handicap as a good/bad thing that influences (or is influenced by) the character's capacity to interact with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">whatever magic is in the setting</a>, meaning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural">Neurodiversity Is Supernatural</a>.
<p>While it's certainly an improvement on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">pity</a>, it can get irritating since most disabled people really just want to get on with relatively normal lives, with maybe a few accommodations like ramps, appropriate medication and as little patronising as possible.

</p><p></p><h2>Magical:</h2>
This Inspirationally Disadvantaged person is of the Magical kind, with shades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a>. This flavor of Inspirationally Disadvantaged is there to be a good influence and teach the non-disabled lead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead">who is often white and male</a> (but with some exceptions), a Very Special Lesson. Quite often, the person who is Magically Inspirationally Disadvantaged is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a>.
<p>All types are seen as exploitative, with disabled characters often being little more than gimmicks to tug the heartstrings of able-bodied and able-minded viewers and make them feel "inspired" without actually challenging them to <em>do</em> anything about the systems that make life so difficult for the disabled in the first place, objectifying actual disabled people (hence the reason why disabled people refer to this trope as "inspiration porn"). In addition, the trope is so well known that many people slap ANY disabled character with the label regardless of how they're portrayed.

<ul><li> Averted and deconstructed with Prince Healing Song. Despite being blinded during infancy, he still managed to become a famous and beloved musical prodigy. And against all odds, he Ascended to godhood while on his deathbed, dying from cancer. At the same time, he's flawed like everyone else - while usually a humble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, he's willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">joke about himself</a>, and can get rather sarcastic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">blunt</a>, especially when people insult and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion">patronize</a> him. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortalityPhobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortalityPhobia">feared dying one day</a>, but his friends helped him accept his mortality. Healing Song himself hates the "Inspirationally Disadvantaged" stereotype because it creates the toxic belief that disabled people who don't push themselves beyond their limits are automatically helpless and lazy. If a disabled person manages to Ascend to godhood like he did, then it happens and is not related to their disability in any way, though it's still an achievement worthy of praise. This motivates Healing Song to teach his students how to succeed while acknowledging their own limits.
</li><li> Averted with Guiding Light. While he's blind and has several abilities and skills to make up for it, it's noted in his entry that the Shinseina pantheon chose to Ascend him (as well as his friends) solely because of his compassion and altruism, and they taught him many things so he could fulfill his role as a Death god despite his disability. Their desire to turn him into a benevolent and proper god stems from the fact that they find a few of his flaws (namely his cynicism, morbid sense of humor, and opportunistic greed) off-putting and potentially detrimental to any good he might do as a demigod. Guiding Light also gets irritated whenever someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion">pities him and/or gives him special treatment for being blind</a>, and is close to his friends in the BHCIT <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">despite their constant ribbing</a> because they treat him as part of the group rather than an invalid.
</li><li> Averted with Spell Cyclone. She is a paraplegic Magical Filly and requires a wheelchair to get around, which would normally make her an easier target in Meridia, so she developed her sniping skills and magic to make up for this. She hates the idea of pushing herself beyond her normal limits in order to be something of worth to others, a view shared by Prince Healing Song, who is blind and would later become her friend. She welcomes Maelstrom's insults because it means the latter really cares for her and treats her like an equal.
</li><li> Averted with Prince Crimson Star. Originally, he wasn't blind, but he was such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> that after he was blinded saving a classmate from a runaway carriage, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness">rather depressed by it</a>, and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallItKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallItKarma">came to believe that his blindness was a "punishment" for his own foolishness</a>. He did manage to become an Alicorn demigod later on, but it's because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">made amends for his bad behavior</a> and used his knowledge and talents for good, not because he became disabled. In addition, despite his royal demi-divine status and great power, he is flawed like any other person, and his relationships with some of his brothers, like Fanged Paw, can get vitriolic.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DustinHoffman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DustinHoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>'s autistic savant character Raymond in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Man</a></em> is a quintessential example. The film's use of this trope as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar Bait</a> — combined with its pop culture infiltration, which has spread the stereotype that all people with autism are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRainMan">genius savants</a> — makes its legacy controversial.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOtherSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOtherSister">The Other Sister</a></em> attempts to avoid this trope, but much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallowHal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallowHal">Shallow Hal</a></em>'s utter failure at being "fat positive", the movie falls short of showing a developmentally disabled girl's moving out of her parents house and falling in love as anything other than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmy</a> "triumph of the human spirit."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mask1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mask1985">Mask</a></em> avoids most of the pitfalls associated with this trope, given that Rocky doesn't suffer from his condition even though it is killing him. In fact, it is rather spectacularly lampshaded in an early scene, when an idiot schoolmaster doesn't exactly realise that Rocky is <em>not</em> "special needs".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere">Being There</a></em> (and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeeminglyProfoundFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeeminglyProfoundFool">Seemingly Profound Fool</a> character type in general) was actually an <strong>aversion</strong> of this, and now can be seen as a subversion of straight examples such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a></em>. Chance has an intellectual disability and is forced out on the streets when the master of his household dies. He rises to great heights and inspires others - but not because of any of his own qualities. Instead, he happens to encounter powerful people who <em>think</em> he's extremely intelligent, and interpret his concrete statements as metaphors. He's a sweet fellow but has no great inner reserves of strength or wisdom. He's just very lucky.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmSam">i am sam</a></em> is about a single dad with an intellectual disability fighting the state for custody of his daughter. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020125/REVIEWS/201250303/1023">was just one of the critics who thought<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the movie represented a bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">Strawman Has a Point</a> when it came to portraying Sam as in the right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy">Tommy</a></em> is actually <em>not</em> about a "deaf, dumb, and blind kid (who) sure plays a mean pinball!" and is an aversion of this. Tommy's father was a WWII soldier mistakenly listed as dead. His mother became involved with another man. Then his father returned home and was killed in a fight with the lover. Tommy saw this and was told repeatedly not to tell anyone, that he didn't see or hear anything. His life from that point was anything but inspirational or idyllic. His ability to play pinball well was not an inspiring message, it was just the last tenuous link back to the outside world that he had left before finally breaking through his mental block.
<ul><li> The stage adaptation <em>The Who's Tommy</em> (written in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>) has the post-recovery Tommy telling Sally Simpson that she and others who see him as an inspiration shouldn't want to be more like him, given what he went through. Since he won't give them the answers they're seeking in life (and play this trope straight), they turn on him. Ironically, he almost regresses back to his old state after this rejection, but pulls himself out of it and reconciles with his family instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder">Tropic Thunder</a></em> mocks this trope with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar Bait</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmWithinAFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmWithinAFilm">Film Within a Film</a> <em>Simple Jack</em>. It wound up backfiring on its star, Tugg Speedman, and it came to be viewed as one of the worst films of all time (though it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">inexplicably popular among Golden Triangle drug lords</a>). Kirk Lazarus attributes the film's failure to the fact that the character was portrayed as <em>too</em> mentally disabled (or, in his parlance, Tugg "went full retard" in his performance) and lacking the "inspirational" part of this trope, citing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmSam">i am sam</a></em> as an example. As a result, Tugg's performance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">was just plain insulting and uncomfortable to watch</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar Bait</a> angle also gets a brief mention in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bowfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bowfinger">Bowfinger</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><em>"A black dude who plays a slave that gets his ass whipped gets the nomination, a white guy who plays an idiot gets the Oscar. That's what I need, I need to play a retarded slave, then I'll get the Oscar."</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizard">The Wizard</a></em> concerns a young, implicitly autistic boy who turns out to have a talent for beating arcade games. His older brother decides to use this skill to gain money — and everyone he meets encourages him to do so.
</li><li> Speaking of autism and Fred Savage, there's a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Glurge-heavy</a> brain tulip from the mid-'80s entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoyWhoCouldFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoyWhoCouldFly">The Boy Who Could Fly</a></em> (reviewed <a class="urllink" href="http://madnessmonster.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/boy-who-could-fly-review/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and it is about an autistic boy who is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a> that he can... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">well...</a>
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic">Biopics</a> are not spared. The blind pianist Ray Charles comes to mind. That film can be seen as somewhat of a subversion, as Charles' flaws are not glossed over or sugarcoated (most notably, his womanizing).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> uses this in their recent movies in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">win a Filmfare Award</a>. Blind Michelle McNally (played by Rani Mukherjee) in 2005's <em>Black</em> and mentally-disabled Rohit (played by Hrithik Roshan) in 2003's <em>Koi...Mil Gaya</em> are examples. Naturally, they won.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlingBlade">Sling Blade</a></em>. Karl has an intellectual disability and the film focuses predominantly on how difficult everyday life is for him, displaying no <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Man</a></em>-esque abilities save for a knack for mechanics. He has just been released from an institution after murdering his mother and her lover when he was twelve and finds it almost impossible to adjust to life outside. Karl's early hardships are also deeply horrific (his younger brother was stillborn and his father forced him to bury the body), but never played for inspiration or a source of glurge.
</li></ul><ul><li> Deconstructed in the Joseph Merrick biopic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElephantMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElephantMan">The Elephant Man</a></em>. The deformed title character, a former circus freak, is indeed an intelligent, sensitive, and very kind man, but the film takes a very dim view of any attempts at making him into a symbol.
<div class="indent">If you want my advice, he's only being stared at all over again.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRinger">The Ringer</a></em> is a film about a guy who fakes being intellectually disabled in order to join and rig the Special Olympics. Surprisingly, it manages to avoid being as disparaging to disabled people as one would expect from the premise, but it's also been praised for not going in the other direction, either. The Olympians are treated more like actual people (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">it helps that people with actual mental disabilities were hired to play them</a>) crowd-favorite Jimmy Washington <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">has a massive ego</a> and is hated by the other Olympians, and uses their disabilities for one or two jokes (like when main character Steve has to break out a whiteboard and provide visual aids to explain his plan once he's caught) while the Olympians also get to crack a few jokes of their own.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">The Room</a></em> gives us a bizarre subversion of this trope with Denny, an orphaned teenager who's essentially Johnny and Lisa's adopted son. Though he apparently came from poverty, and he struggles to put himself through school, he's never actually said to be disabled at any point in the film... but Tommy Wiseau himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">went on record</a> saying that he's "r*tarded, a little bit", apparently to explain some of the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">more bizarre behavior over the course of the film</a> (most memorably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">he tries to creep into Johnny and Lisa's bedroom mid-foreplay at one point</a>). Hilariously, Wiseau never actually told Denny's actor about that little detail, leading most fans to conclude that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>.
</li><li> In the Colorado-made short film <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCQUktSyCL8">Menschen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> that has been making rounds on the festival circuit. It deals with a group of runaway Nazis in the last days of World War II who come across a sickly sweet boy with Down Syndrome who is just so precocious and adorable, he redeems their evil genocidal hearts and makes them see the error of their ways through the power of love. What makes this even more obnoxious is that the filmmakers <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3D2VXgGZ6c">unknowingly repeated a joke<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a>,</em> but under the pretense of them making a serious historical drama. Real Nazis would more likely have killed the boy, as people with Down Syndrome were among the first targeted for involuntary "euthanasia" in the Aktion T4 program.
</li><li> Mark O'Brien in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSessions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSessions">The Sessions</a></em> has to deal with this within the film. One of our first introductions to him is a news program making a big deal of the fact that he graduated despite his polio.
</li><li> Elijah Price in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable">Unbreakable</a></em> has brittle bones, which confines him to a wheelchair for a good deal of the movie, but is a successful comic book museum owner who encourages the protagonist David Dunn to find the hero within himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, this trope is ultimately subverted, with the ending coming off as a grotesque mockery of the trope. He declares that he's finally found the meaning in his life...becoming a supervillain responsible for the deaths of hundreds</span>.
</li><li> Played unerringly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKidAndI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKidAndI">The Kid &amp; I</a>,</em> where Aaron Roman's cerebral palsy does not stop him from demonstrating tenacity, optimism, and friendship to washed-up actor Bill Williams.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander">Master and Commander</a></em>, there's this moment where this gets invoked. Poor little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyMiddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyMiddie">Midshipman Blakeney</a> has to have his arm amputated after it gets riddled with shot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain Aubrey</a> visits Blakeney resting in his hammock after his surgery. The two share some very typically British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Stiff Upper Lip</a> dialogue and Aubrey recommends a book to the boy; an account of the Battle of the Nile, with several fine illustrations. Aubrey departs and leaves Blakeney to skim through the book, which opens with an illustration of the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Lord Nelson</a>, also missing an arm. It's quite obvious that Aubrey offered the book to the young lad intentionally to inspire him, and true enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">little Blakeney rises up to the challenge</a>.
</li><li> Surprisingly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourWeddingsAndAFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourWeddingsAndAFuneral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a></em>. Charles' brother David is deaf but also happens to be a quite normal person with a fondness for sexual humor. The only things he does which can be described as being "inspirational" is giving his brother an occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheImitationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheImitationGame">The Imitation Game</a></em> applies this heavily to real-life wartime code-breaker Alan Turing - who was reportedly <em>not</em> like this in real life (a notable scene is where he's shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind">Sarcasm-Blind</a>; the real Turing was described as quite witty and charming by people who knew him). One of the film's main criticisms came from focusing on this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooGay">downplaying his homosexuality</a> to the point that it was almost an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a>.

But it also deconstructs this trope. While Stephen's mind remains brilliant, he is shown as a flawed human being while his body deteriorates.

When at a music competition her band is given the top prize over Leila being disabled and the judge tries to hold her up this way, she's disgusted, flipping the woman off afterward.

His brother Gilbert and the rest of his family are extremely protective of him and nobody in the town is shown to treat him poorly, but his complete lack of self-preservation skills and tendency for meltdowns tend to get him in trouble.

Either way, readers are meant to find some "inspirational" value in the disability element.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrotherCadfael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrotherCadfael">Brother Cadfael</a></em> novel "The Pilgrim of Hate", Rhun is a teenager who has had a crippling disability since he was a young child, but his serene acceptance and uncomplaining nature ultimately make him deserving of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a miracle cure from the local saint</span>. In contrast, the titular pilgrim Ciaran has chosen to walk barefoot across the country with a heavy cross around his neck, and his wallowing in his "chosen disability" is depicted as self-serving and arrogant.

Jackson meets a wheelchair-bound girl who smiles at him when he arrives, and he is inspired by this — she has, in his view (she isn't quoted as saying anything along these lines) not let herself be influenced by adults' pity and sympathy and clearly doesn't want pity or sympathy herself, not being bothered by her "disability" and seeing herself as normal. This crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">Children Are Innocent</a>, a core Jackson belief, in that they do not realize they are different from others and thus are "wiser" than adults who can only see differences.

One of the reasons Dengel is looked upon so favorably by humans is that he became a powerful mage despite possessing a magical disorder called Low Mana Inhibition, which makes controlling mana substantially harder. Thus, he is the "super crip". Eric, who knows him to be an arrogant jerkass, is not at all inspired.

</li><li> <em>The Blue Rose</em> by Gerda Klein. The main character, Jenny, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">kids make fun of her</a> for having a developmental disability.

</li><li> Downplayed in the "I Funny" books with protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabledSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabledSnarker">Jamie Grimm</a>. While he's considered an inspiration by the hospital that got him up to wheelchair-bound from total body cast, it's because of his optimism, not being handicapped. Jamie has also gone on record repeatedly as intending to get the use of his legs back if procedures to do so become available and when media tries to paint him as this trope, he gets annoyed and even suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBlueScreenOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBlueScreenOfDeath">Heroic Blue Screen of Death</a> over it at one point (and it doesn't help that since the reason that he's in his chair is a car accident that killed his parents and beloved little sister Jenny, this is just salting the wounds the tragedy left and that he spends most of the series dealing with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">as much as he skips over the topic to get back to jokes</a>). That said, he does enjoy being an inspiration to other handicapped kids though he prefers it when it's of the "I won't let my limitations prevent me from being the best me I can" variety (a healthy way of looking at it).

She was played by Geri Jewell, an actress and stand-up comedienne who, like "Cousin Geri", has cerebral palsy. She was the first performer with a disability to have a recurring role in a TV series. Cousin Geri was treated as inspirational by some of the girls, but Cousin Geri herself was rather snarky about her condition as well as not having much use for being seen as anything but a person. Jewell continued as a recurring regular for four years; when, in the sixth season, the showrunners wanted Cousin Geri to only appear in Very Special Episodes once a season, Jewell quit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> featured a number of these.

While other characters in the montage are identified with labels explaining their roles (Such as "fireman" or "teacher"), the Inspirationally Disadvantaged characters are each identified with the label "Angel". Y'know, because they're closer to God and all.
</li><li> Averted with Jake on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Becker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Becker">Becker</a></em>, who happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoferTokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoferTokenMinority">a blind black man</a>.

She tries to be one of these, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">reality</a> gets in her way. Best shown in a scene where Rose tries to get her a cane so she can make her way through the room without falling over the various stuff the girls have spread around for the garage sale they're throwing, but she insists that she'll be fine because she memorized the layout of the house. Cue Rose, Dorothy, and Blanche dashing back and forth moving things out of her way.

<ul><li> <em>The Golden Girls</em> had several episodes where a disabled character appears, but none are never portrayed with this trope. In particular, Blanche dates two: a blind man, who she ends up pushing away after starting to fall for him, not because he's blind, but because she relies so heavily on her looks that she can't trust herself to keep the interest of a man who can't see her, and a man in a wheelchair, who <em>appears</em> Inspirationally Disadvantaged, until it's revealed he's cheating on his wife, and Blanche realizes that he's just as much a jerk as any guy, he just happens to be sitting down.

Some of his family and friends will patronize him sometimes (which is, unfortunately, the truth for many people with developmental disabilities) but they usually treat him just the same as anyone else. He gets in just as much trouble as his sister when he screws up and gets equal praise when he does well.

Includes a woman with dwarfism (Charla - Seasons 5 &amp; 11), several people with missing limbs (Sarah - Season 10, Amy - Season 21, Bethany - Season 25, &amp; Redmond - Season 29), a deaf man (Luke - Seasons 14 &amp; 18), and a man on the Autism spectrum (Zev - Seasons 15 &amp; 18). The only winner who could be considered this was Nat in Season 17 who is type 1 diabetic. It was very rarely brought up but making time to track her blood sugar and eat regularly was the hardest part of the race for her and her partner Kat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven">Highway to Heaven</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> Recurring character Scotty is a paraplegic who, in his first appearance passes the bar exam despite his handicap. Scotty makes appearances in later episodes where his law firm is failing but then succeeds because he doesn't quit and partially because he helps others with perceived disabilities.
</li><li> In the same episode that introduces Scotty, a high-school student with a promising career in sports loses the use of his legs, but thanks to the inspiration of Scotty and the boy that caused him to be paralyzed, the boy learns gymnastics, which is something of a head-scratcher, considering that the event he learns to do is the pommel horse, which probably isn't possible with a pair of paralyzed legs flopping around.
</li><li> The homeless boy in "Alone". All he wants is someone to love him. He manages to reunite a family and gain one of his own in the process.
</li><li> In "A Special Love", this two-part episode has Todd, a boy with Down Syndrome, afraid to participate in any sports until he meets the inspirational Scotty (see above).
</li></ul></li><li> This trope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a> by Mulder in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> when Scully tells him he's like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Captain Ahab</a>:
<div class="indent"><em>"You know, it's interesting you should say that because I've always wanted a peg leg. It's a boyhood thing I never grew out of. I'm not being flippant, I've given this a lot of thought. I mean, if you have a peg leg or hooks for hands then maybe it's enough to simply keep on living. You know, bravely facing life with your disability. But without these things you're actually meant to make something of your life, achieve something earn a raise, wear a necktie. So if anything, I'm actually the antithesis of Ahab, because if I did have a peg leg, I'd quite possibly be more happy and more content not to be chasing after these creatures of the unknown."</em>

The fact that resident genius Dr. Ballard uses a wheelchair is almost never mentioned in the series. There was one episode that focused on it, and every now and then he'd make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">joke regarding it</a>, as real people might, but that's it.
</li><li> The main character on <em>M.A.N.T.I.S.</em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple">wheelchair-bound genius</a> who built a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> that let him walk - and fight crime. Not quite a straight example, as the protagonist was already a brilliant robotics engineer <em>before</em> being rendered paraplegic. He built himself a cool wheelchair in the form of an exoskeleton that compensated for the loss of motor function, then belatedly realised that he had in fact created the technology for fully functional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour">Powered Armour</a> and decided to just run with it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>:
<ul><li> Doctor Kevin Casey is an incredibly skilled surgeon with OCD. He attributes his skill directly to this, explaining that he was forced by his condition to read reference books obsessively until he memorised them. However, the trope is subverted at the end when the main characters get jealous and go to confront him, only to see him several hours after surgery still obsessively washing his hands, leading them to realise how much he really is suffering.
</li><li> Made worse by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">Reality Subtext</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelJFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelJFox">Michael J.

As such, she had been unable to keep a job, yet refused to admit that she needed help. However, she had become a very talented dancer (she could map out the tune of the music by feeling the vibrations). Sam convinced her to audition for a dance troupe. Although she initially performed well, she was unable to understand that she was to improvise her own routine because she had been unable to read the instructor's lips (not knowing of her condition, the woman had turned away from her as she was speaking). Humiliated, she prepared to begin working for an escort service, only to have Sam show up and convince her and the dance troupe leader to give her another chance.
</li><li> A character on the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em>, Abby (and the actress playing her) had been deaf from birth but could read lips so well that other characters often forgot that she couldn't hear them. Aside from this, the character was given typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> storylines, all of which never made her disability an issue—aside from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a>, where she was unable to hear her attacker creeping up on her—and eventually, the actress' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> decision to have a cochlear implant was incorporated into the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver">Canada's Worst Driver</a></em> had an Incorruptible in Season 7's Aaron.

</li><li> Wonderfully averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>'s Joey Lucas (Marlee Matlin), a polling genius who just happens to be deaf and use an interpreter (named Kenny). The characters never go out of their way to avoid mentioning the fact - it just is, and it has no effect on her ability to do her job, or her interactions with the main cast. One suspects Matlin herself had a great deal to do with this portrayal, as she is deaf in real life. It also provided one of the funniest moments in <em>West Wing</em> history:
<div class="indent"><strong>Joey (through Kenny):</strong> Joshua Lyman, you have the cutest little butt in professional politics.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Josh (without missing a beat):</strong> Kenny, really, that better have been her talking.
</div></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> with Tyrion Lannister (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage">Peter Dinklage</a>). He has been born with a hereditary bone condition leading to dwarfism. Despite his family's high status and immense wealth he is often mocked as "half-man" and "imp". He himself is very aware of this: "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes." (Tyrion has a following in the fandom, because he is one of the funniest, most interesting, and probably most moral characters on the show, and because Peter Dinklage's performance is fantastic, but his being a dwarf has little to do with any of this except to the extent that the discrimination informs the character's worldview and interactions with other characters.)
</li><li> Subverted, and then some, by a scenario on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatWouldYouDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatWouldYouDo">What Would You Do?</a></em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot">an episode based on viewer ideas</a>. A wheelchair-using woman, who had sent the idea in, played herself in a supermarket as an actress not only went up to her and gushingly lampshaded the trope, she went on to patronizingly do things for her that she was clearly capable of doing for herself, even wheeling her around at one point. All were things the woman said had actually happened to her. Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMark">the passersby</a> reacted by telling the actress to calm down and back off.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> which had a clip from a fictional movie "Little Foot, Long Foot", where the main character has one of his legs severely atrophied. He gets a standing ovation from accomplishing the monumental task of getting up on a barstool without help.

He's always willing to protect Didi, especially from Earl (who wronged her in the past, and whom she resents.) He's kind of a subversion, though, because he beats up Earl before the latter even says anything.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Earl</strong>: "And as handi-capable as one-legged Didi was, her no-legged boyfriend was even handi-capabler."
</div></li><li> The trope is also played with when Randy says to a young woman "For someone in a wheelchair, you're not very inspirational."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a></em> was spoofed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFastShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFastShow">The Fast Show</a></em>, with a trailer for a fictional film about 'a cute disabled man'. It won an award for 'best portrayal of a disabled man by a fit and healthy young actor'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kerry Weaver. Despite walking with a crutch throughout most of her time on the show (due to congenital hip dysplasia), she was consistently portrayed as an excellent physician. Even more remarkable, this was in a specialty like Emergency Medicine which requires considerable mobility. As well, her abrasive personality, rather than warm and fuzzy, might even subvert this example.
</li><li> The series also featured a small arc in an early season where Peter Benton discovered that his son was deaf. He met a doctor who was marketed as a "deaf specialist" of sorts only to discover that the doctor herself was deaf and relied on an interpreter for communication. The doctor had been profoundly deaf since she was young and still managed to complete medical school in a time where treating the disabled like everyone else was uncommon. She slightly invokes this trope in the sense that her character is primarily used as an example to Peter that being deaf is not the end of the world, but also to other staff as well.
</li></ul></li><li> This is parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners">The Inbetweeners</a></em> with Alistair. Alistair was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> before he had a kidney transplant and ended up in a wheelchair, and is still one after.

They talk and sing about how wonderful it is that he only has one wing because that means he can glow and give glory to God...or something.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>: Leslie reads an "inspiring" book about a woman with no limbs who tried to swim the English Channel, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">drowned instantly</a>.

His entrance is applauded the moment he enters his class, simply because he's disabled. Then he's immediately nominated for class president by his homeroom <em>before they even meet him</em>. When pressed further, the teacher just gives out meaningless platitudes about how brave J.J. is instead of saying it outright.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, when Echo's programmed personality is a hostage negotiation specialist. Topher explains that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleWearGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleWearGlasses">glasses aren't to make her look smarter</a>; her implanted personality is short-sighted and her intellect comes from the drive to overcome such imperfections.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/USAHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/USAHigh">USA High</a></em> had Jackson falling for a blind girl in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>. It gets subverted when the girl's blindness is rather incidental to the main conflict - Jackson being afraid of commitment - and the girl only assumes his break-up with her is because of her blindness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em> and its spinoff series <em>Promised Land</em> featured a few. Of note is Chris Burke, an actor with Down Syndrome who appeared on both shows. In <em>Promised Land,</em> he's a regular guy named Bob, but in <em>Touched by an Angel,</em> he's an angel named Taylor. This isn't necessarily meant as patronizing but comes across that way. Other disabilities covered on both shows include autism, Asperger's Syndrome (though this is not specifically identified), and cerebral palsy.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> episode, "The Jimmy" when Kramer, who's still under the effects of Novocaine (he's slurring his words and drooling a bit) and still wearing Jimmy's strange training shoes, is mistaken for a mentally-challenged adult by an executive of a benefit for "Able Mentally-Challenged Adults" and invited to the event. Kramer, completely oblivious, goes along with this.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em>, Rocky takes an interest in a girl who practices karate, and whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> is to defeat three male opponents in a row, and that's <em>before</em> we learn that she's actually blind.

The narrator is a carnival barker trying to talk up a sideshow performer who seems to be just a disembodied eye.

Since all forms of diseases, death and discomfort had been effectively removed from the most advanced parts of the galaxy, people started to realize the importance of this trope, and so anybody out to become famous in the galaxy took to wearing a watch-like device that would simulate the challenges of being deaf/blind/handicapped/crippled/chased by assassins without the inconvenience of actually <em>being</em> disabled.

It's also subverted on two accounts: piloting a ship is something that doesn't require strong bones, and Joker is still the best pilot in the Alliance, and if you ask him about his background, he says, "If you're looking for an inspirational story about the crippled kid who overcame impossible odds, you're gonna be disappointed." Turns out that since his parents were spacers, he was going to join the Academy regardless of whether he had his disability.

The story is set in a school for disabled students and all of the main characters have some form of disability, but all of them are much deeper than merely this and their setbacks are always portrayed realistically, neither overdoing them nor ignoring them completely. Many of the characters are perfectly comfortable with themselves, with Emi proudly labeling herself 'the fastest thing on no legs' and Lilly becoming very amused when people get flustered over saying things like 'see you around' in her presence.
<ul><li> It's discussed a little as well - if Hisao patronizes Hanako, she will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become extremely pissed off with him and a Bad End will result.</span> Also, in Rin's route, Hisao gets uncomfortable when the art teacher suggests mentioning Rin's disability (she has no arms and paints with her feet) to attract attention (the art teacher himself says that if they play up Rin's disability, they'll be accused of exploiting it, but if they hide it, they'll be accused of discrimination), and when Hisao sees that Emi is an extremely good runner, he resists the urge to say something like 'especially since you have prosthetic legs' when telling her that she's very impressive for fear that it would take away from the compliment.

Unfortunately, in February 2013 he was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend. <em>The Onion</em> article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/report-world-now-down-to-5-stories-that-are-inspir,31303">"World Now Down To 5 Stories That Are Inspirational"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was written in its wake, as well as the photo caption <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">"Double Amputee Proves He Is Capable Of Anything"</a>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> comedy show <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MyGimpyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MyGimpyLife">My Gimpy Life</a></em> in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYTnldzk9nc&amp;list=PL8DFDC12B1B8CFC85&amp;index=4">Episode 3: Inspirational<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The main character Teal (who's in a wheelchair) bombs an audition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheVaginaMonologues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheVaginaMonologues">The Vagina Monologues</a></em> and knows it, but is applauded and called "inspirational" by the members of the company putting it on, all of whom are African American. Eventually, Teal gets sick of it and calls out the company, saying it's as if she had complemented them for being articulate or said that they could pass for white. They, of course, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">massively offended</a>
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Felix from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>. Kim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">treats him as a disadvantaged boy</a> through the episode, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">she learns to accept</a> that he kicks ass. It's also played for laughs with Ron, who treats Felix like any other guy. Felix is glad Ron doesn't give a wet slap, but it seriously bugs Kim.
</li><li> Jimmy and Timmy have been used to both lampshade and subvert this trope on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. Generally averted with the other kids, who treat both just like they would any other friends or classmates.
<ul><li> And there's also the "Conjoined Fetus Lady" episode. Nurse Gollum is a school nurse who has had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysonTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysonTheTin">her dead twin attached to the side of her head since birth</a>, and who only wants to do her job without being fawned over for her "courage." She doesn't even mind kids getting freaked out by her appearance. But when Kyle's mom finds out about her she not only lectures the kids on being sensitive to the disabled but eventually convinces the town to throw an awards banquet for the nurse and a parade complete with <em>dead fetus headbands</em>! Nurse Gollum ends the episode by calling them out on their behavior, and she became a minor reoccurring character for a while.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> Teo averts this trope. Teo might be an excellent pilot, but this is never suggested to be because he is paraplegic, nor does any of the other characters seem to consider him in any way unusual. The only notice anyone takes of Teo's handicap is when Sokka is impressed by his "glider chair". Also, in spite of only being in two scenes in The Day of Black Sun, and not doing much in either, he was on the front lines in the end so we can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">assume</a> that he was fighting the whole time.
</li><li> Then there's Toph, though she's more along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>. Also averted, as she's happy to make blind jokes about herself as well as jokes at other peoples' expense about her blindness, and her genuine setbacks (being functionally illiterate in a world without Braille) are merely acknowledged.
</li></ul></li><li> Avoided with Garrett of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExtremeGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExtremeGhostbusters">Extreme Ghostbusters</a></em>, paralyzed from birth, but is the jock of the group. Not only does he enjoy sports (character profiles stated he is one of the best wheelchair basketball players in the Boroughs), but he often does things like getting across the city by holding on to the bumper of a bus, and <em>jumping off a building with a parachute</em>. Given these activities, the writers could be accused of trying just a bit too hard to show that his disability didn't limit him, but he was still praised for his portrayal. He's also willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantFeelMyLegs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantFeelMyLegs">crack jokes about his condition</a>, and the one time he shows any offense is when he thinks Egon is patronizing him by telling him to stay back (He wasn't, Egon was just having a mid-life crisis and trying to take a more active role in the group). Heck; in the first episode, his reaction to Eduardo blatantly mocking his handicap is a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHeardThatOneBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHeardThatOneBefore">Never Heard That One Before</a>" eye roll and nothing else.
</li><li> Joe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> started as a straight example, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> made him as much of a jerk as everyone else.
<ul><li> Averted in the infamous "Extra Large Medium", in which Chris' infatuation with his Down Syndrome classmate rapidly dwindles as she spends the entire date being a rotten, demanding bitch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> infamously criticized the portrayal, which provoked a response from the actress (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabledCharacterDisabledActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabledCharacterDisabledActor">who has the condition herself</a>), expressing the opinion that Sarah was no less trying to invoke this trope by shilling Palin's relationship with her own Down Syndrome child for political gain.
</li><li> In "Petarded", Peter finds out he's functionally retarded. He even gets a social worker who makes a big deal over <em>everything</em> he does, saying "Good job, Peter! High-five! Alright!" Eventually, he uses his diagnosis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityAsAnExcuseForJerkassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityAsAnExcuseForJerkassery">to get away with all kinds</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> behavior, and when that puts Lois in the hospital the state takes custody of his kids from him...
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CliffordTheBigRedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CliffordTheBigRedDog">Clifford the Big Red Dog</a></em> has Clifford, T-Bone, and Cleo meeting K.C., a dog who's missing a leg. T-Bone and Cleo are afraid of him at first and fear that if they touch him they will lose a leg, and Clifford is worried that he can't play as well as they can. K.C. eventually tells them that they won't lose their legs and proves that he can play as well as a four-legged dog.
<ul><li> They even balance it out with K.C. admitting towards the end of the episode that while it does annoy him when others assume he constantly needs help, he <em>does</em> need help from time to time and he is grateful that Clifford is willing to offer it.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>. Peggy starts making sculptures out of discarded propane tanks, which draws the eye of an art dealer. However, at her first exhibition, she learns that the guy has been portraying her as an idiot savant hillbilly.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17wso');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17wso" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17wso');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The exhibition is even titled "I Ain't Got No Book-Learnin'".</span> Needless to say, she's not happy, and even less so is Hank, but her spirits get lifted at the end of the episode when a few people express honest love of her "pro-bots".
<ul><li> Another episode deals with Bill being told his legs will fail due to diabetes. Bill prepares by getting a wheelchair in advance and joins a handicapped basketball team/club. When Bill drunkenly stands up and begins to walk to the bathroom, he discovers that not only have his legs not failed, but his diabetes has reversed. Being branded as a fraud and no longer praised as an inspiration, he begins to scoop sugar into his mouth to regain his diabetes to become handicapped again until Hank and one of his basketball friends stop him and talk him out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally averted with Scootaloo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>. Though conceived as a pegasus who simply hadn't learned how to fly yet, she is all but stated in season 4 to suffer from a disability that keeps her from achieving flight. However, this means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Scootaloo has gone through three seasons without facing any grief from anyone over her physical disadvantages</a>, and the only teasing she ever gets for it is done to psych her out of an already impressive stage performance she and her friends put together.
</li><li> The PBS series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> does a pretty good job of averting this. It has featured at least two characters with disabilities; Marina Datillo is blind and Lydia Fox uses a wheelchair. Both girls are given talents and hobbies outside disability, but none of these are treated like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>. The characters make jokes about their disabilities (ex.: Marina says she can't read super-fast because "[she'd] get blisters.") In general, they are portrayed as normal kids with both good traits and flaws.
<ul><li> Recent seasons have given us Carl Gould, a boy with Asperger's Syndrome who's a good friend of George Lundgren. Although George sometimes has to act as Carl's "interpreter", explaining what he needs and why, Carl is a three-dimensional character.
</li><li> Another good aversion shows up in "Little Miss Meanie." Muffy and Lydia enter the Little Miss Crocus pageant, and Muffy assumes the judges will let Lydia win because shes paraplegic. She even considers asking Lydia to drop out because she can't "win" on her own merits  but then hears another girl tell Lydia the same thing, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">realizes how mean the assumption is</a>. When Lydia finds out about it from Francine, shes initially angry, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">then admits that shes not really one to talk</a>. Lydia initially assumed that Muffy, being from an extremely rich family, was going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">bribe the judges so she could get the grand prize</a>, so Lydia was thinking about asking <em>her</em> to drop out of the pageant. She had a similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a> when she saw the same snob who told her to drop out accusing Muffy of using her affluence as an unfair advantage. This shows a character with a disability having to deal with, and overcoming, her own prejudices, which is rare especially in children's programming. Afterwards, Muffy and Lydia decide to team up and help improve each others acts. They end up tying for first runner-up, while the snobby girl receives no honors.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em> has Reggie take this trope to extremes when she meets a girl her age with a fake leg and a passion for sports. She decides to write an article about her in a magazine and gleefully declares that she'll say that she's the best handicapped snowboarder ever. To which Sam replies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading">"I think she'd rather be the best snowboarder period!"</a>. At the end of the episode, the girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">takes offense when Reggie deliberately wipes out</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin">to let her win the snowboard race</a>.
</li><li> Both lampshaded and averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a> episode "Stealing First Base", when Nelson Muntz befriends Kevin, a blind boy. Upon noticing Kevin's disability, Nelson becomes extremely protective of him and threatens to "destroy" anyone trying to mess with him, to which Kevin answers that one messes with him. Then Nelson tells Kevin that he's not a freak, and when Kevin answers that he doesn't think of himself as a freak, a very touched Nelson exclaims, "So BRAVE!".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys">The Wild Thornberrys</a></em> has Eliza learn how annoying this trope can be. The episode in question has her meet a lively girl with Cerebral Palsy and a penchant for adventurous activities. Eliza is understandably worried that she might end up hurting herself and her efforts to accommodate the girl are marked by what she dubs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">"I'm sorry you're disabled look."</a> The episode culminates in the two having an argument about it and Eliza realizing that her efforts only made it seem like she couldn't see anything other than the girl's disability.
