Some people might just have been born that way, but these guys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">sacrificed a basic skill for awesome training</a>. Whether from lifestyle, schooling, or personal preference they have grown up without learning a very basic skill. It can be a chore like cooking or laundry, to more important things like reading and dating, or downright <em>essential</em> like dressing oneself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">social interaction</a>.
</p><p>As a result of a sheltered and highly structured lifestyle where their education and training was tightly controlled, they become so that a key part in their upbringing or skill set is completely ignored, sometimes <em>purposely</em> by their teacher as "unnecessary" or distracting. Before long, they become something of an idiot savant: an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer">expert artist</a> that is nonetheless unable to carry out a basic ability. In extreme cases, they may not even understand it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope has two different setups. The more common one involves a character who spends their formative years in a convent, school or sequestered in a family home and trained in the "family ways". Usually, these involve warfare, magic, or assassination. Expect there to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a> especially that is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">highly specialized</a> it leaves no room for anything else. So instead of Home Ec 101, they're getting Tundra Guerrilla Tactics 101. The children who "graduate" are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bombs</a>, in which case it was probably done purposely by their teacher. They might have considered it "unnecessary" or distracting, or useful to exclude both to make their job easier and keep the student tightly controlled. In the case of a school or the like, the students are likely so rigorously policed and kept apart that they don't interact enough to learn basic social skills.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The other set up is perhaps more alien: a character purposely ignores the basic skill because he or she considers it "wasteful". This isn't just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> forking off laundry to a maid, but usually a highly focused (or at least willful) character who purposely avoids all knowledge in that field in favor of more interesting pursuits.
</p><p>Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> moment when the princess is dumped on the street or the chaste assassin rebel starts interacting with the (very sexy) opposite gender. Usually they'll make a friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpbringingMakesTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpbringingMakesTheHero">(or partner)</a> who can help them with the missing skill.
</p><p>If there is a whole <em>team</em> of people with the same absent basic skill, expect them to panic and try their best to do the job themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">Understandably, you can expect</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarious results</a>.
</p><p>If the character has developed awesome abilities and lacks important skills due to a mental difference rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, they may be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant">Idiot Savant</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRainman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRainman">The Rain Man</a>. When what is sacrificed is common sense or social skill, it may lead to the creation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheGreatestMagicMastersRetirementPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheGreatestMagicMastersRetirementPlan">The Greatest Magic Masters Retirement Plan</a></em>: Due to his talents in magic, Alus Reigin was recruited into the military at age six and spent most of his life in training and combat, but has no idea how to function as a civilian. When he sees a vending machine in the school cafeteria, he needs help from Tesfia and Alice to operate it.
</li><li> Medaka of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> can do <em>everything</em>, literally <em>everything</em>. She is a master of every single sport ever played, top of <em>every</em> class, could read entire libraries of books when she <em>was three</em>, can rip entire buildings off their foundations with her bare hands, <strong>and</strong> she has a superpower that lets her copy and perfect any other superpowers she witnesses. Because of her near perfection though, her people skills are non-existent. She can barely understand how normal people work and generally causes trouble everywhere she goes. It has required the lifetime of effort and struggle of her childhood friend Zenkichi to just barely keep her in check. <br/>To a lesser extent, it's shown that because of this flaw, the one thing Medaka is actually bad at is any form of artistic expression. In one chapter she plays the drums for the first time in her life; though her technique is described as godly, it utterly fails to inspire any kind of emotion in those who hear it. Zenkichi describes her performance as <em>too</em> perfect, remarking that because it lacks the human touch of little slip-ups or errors it doesn't "feel" right, and explicitly says that it's like the opposite of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> effect. <br/>Another flaw in this ability is she will learn things regardless of whether she intends to or not. For this reason, it is dangerous for her to face an opponent who's ability might actually be a problem such as Munakata's impulsive need to kill and understanding of how to kill others. Unlike Munakata, who is kind-hearted so he restrains his ability, Medaka doesn't understand right from wrong beyond their concepts so it's likely she'd have become a crazed killer.
</li><li> L from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> raised in an orphanage for genius children,</span> making him insanely smart, but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> and a couple other... uhh, quirks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later on in the series we meet Mello and Near, two kids from the same orphanage who split the difference. Near is possibly even smarter than L in things not involving human interaction but has essentially no living skills and is entirely reliant on people around him to carry out his plans. Mello is less intelligent than both (though by no means an idiot) but is far more socially competent and capable of taking matters into his own hands.</span>
</li><li> Sosuke Sagara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>. Most of the time, he approaches everyday life as if he were in a combat environment. He has landmines buried on school grounds. He responded to a secret admirer leaving him a package by <em>blowing it up</em> from a safe distance as per EOD protocol. And when he was buying food from a popular vendor, Chidori advised him to be "aggressive"...as such, he fired a pistol into the air and made his order as if he were robbing a bank. The tradeoff is that he's an incredible soldier and pilot, especially considering he's a teenager.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08zmv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08zmv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08zmv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">16 at the start of the series, 18 at the end.</span>
<ul><li> There is a darker side to it: Sosuke is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a> who grew up in a thinly veiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Afghanistan, and has at age 16 already spent six years of his life on campaign. It is also heavily implied that he was sexually abused. That is the lens he views the world through. Sosuke was only chosen as Chidori's bodyguard because he was the only candidate with the necessary combat skills who could fit into a high-school environment (anyone else would be in their late twenties at least) and treats life as an ongoing combat situation because... well, that is what his entire life has been.
</li></ul></li><li> Goku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, as his perpetual interest is in fighting. He lived his early childhood in the mountains with only his adoptive grandfather, a hermit martial artist who died early in Goku's childhood. Due to these conditions, Goku has no education, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>, no concepts of things like money and gender, and as we find out later, no job skills either. He can survive very well off the land, and even provide for his family in <em>Z</em>, but his wife isn't entirely happy with the situation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19aw9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19aw9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19aw9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though, if the first episode of <em>Z</em> is to be believed, he could've made a living as a lumberjack working just a couple of months a year, or he could have kept entering (and winning) the World Martial Arts Tournaments for the huge prizes.</span> As an adult, he still remains pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>, yet he's actually quite capable at farming (it was part of his martial arts training with Master Roshi), though it still causes him problems in that he prefers to goof off with training and getting ready for the next fight. The offset of all this? Goku spends almost <em>all</em> of his time training and thinking about fighting, meaning he's exceptionally strong, talented in combat, and always ready to meet the next bad guy who might show up.
<ul><li> On a smaller level, Vegeta. While he does have a family life and is more educated than Goku, he too prefers training over providing for them and socially fits in about as well as a thumbtack in a balloon factory. Contrast him and Goku to characters like Krillin, Gohan, Goten, and Yamcha, who have a history of focusing on their normal lives over training. In a world like <em>Dragon Ball</em>'s, this means they often lose their usefulness.
</li><li> Chiaotzu has incredible psychic powers, but has to count on his fingers to solve single-digit addition and subtraction problems, nor can he tell right from left. This is actually a subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> to Goku and Krillin's training with Master Roshi. Master Roshi actually made a point of taking time for things like basic schooling and proper rest during the year he was training them — this is most likely the only schooling Goku ever got and why he's actually literate or capable of counting. Goku could have potentially sacrificed a <em>lot more</em> of his basic skills, if not for the fact that his early teacher (who also taught his grandfather) ensured that he wouldn't be a <em>total</em> musclehead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used well with characterization when Ash and Pikachu take on Lt. Surge and Raichu. After losing, Ash gets a Thunder Stone, allowing him to evolve Pikachu at any time with it, but Pikachu vehemently refuses to evolve to match Raichu. Turns out that in Lt. Surge's haste to evolve his Pikachu into a Raichu, it didn't learn basic attacks (especially ones involving speed). Bulbasaur and Squirtle also adopt this philosophy, but contrast Charizard who evolved as quickly as possible because of its low self-esteem. While Charizard goes into the Johto region as Ash's strongest Pokemon, he discovers a entire valley filled with Charizards much stronger than he is. This motivates Charizard and Ash to part ways so that Charizard can train there and realize its full potential.
</li><li> Though Charizard's a bit more complicated. While it did evolve early, it remains as Ash's most powerful Pokémon throughout just about the entire series. Its weakness compared to other Charizard is more attributed to the facts that A. It flat out refused to battle/train for most of its time with Ash, and B. The Charizard it's compared to spend ALL their time in brutal training with other Charizard. After Ash's Charizard spends some time training, it briefly comes back and <em>beats a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Legendary Pokémon</a> in a one-on-one battle</em>.
</li><li> Meowth of Team Rocket almost never fights directly, and can't even use Pay Day. This is because, in his efforts to walk and talk like humans, he used up most of his skillset that normal Pokémon use for battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, Sapphire has a bit of a problem with this due to living in the wild for most of her life. She's incredibly strong and agile, with a powerful sense of smell and quite a bit of nature survival knowledge... but she has some trouble with reading and writing. She's not completely illiterate (she maintained <em>some</em> contact with the civilized world), but can't read kanji (original Japanese) or big words (English translation). She is also unaware of <em>what a Pokémon Center is</em>, although she's capable of treating her Pokémon's ailments herself.
</li></ul></li><li> Ippo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em> is the best infighter in Japan, and possibly even the world. However, he's accomplished this by all but ignoring the skills that would make him a well-rounded fighter, to focus his training only into increasing his devastating punching power and his inhuman endurance, and almost nothing else.
<ul><li> Ippo and his coach had given effort to make Ippo into a well-rounded fighter, but had realized that such a choice would be less effective than just training him into the best pure infighter they could because: A) Ippo has a very small physique and very short reach, making him extremely effective in close range but the exact opposite otherwise. B) Ippo is a "top of the top" tier hard-puncher with "inhuman endurance," thus wild brawling, such as trading hits, will be extremely to his advantage C) Ippo just wasn't born to be an outfighter, unable to match the skills of other top-notch boxers in outfighting D) Ippo and his coach are the type of people who cry 'gutsu gutsu', often, almost to the degree of "Throw in the towel?

In particular, see Ranma, Ryouga, Mousse and Shampoo; by and large, they make up for their extensive martial abilities with their lack of social skill and modern knowledge: Ranma, because of his father's upbringing; Ryouga, because of his lack of upbringing; and Shampoo and Mousse, because they were raised in a warrior society.
<ul><li> For a specific example, there is Ranma's training in the Cat Fu school of martial arts. On the one hand, he gained access to a powerful feral attack style that allows him to tear through almost anything as if it were excelsior paper. On the other hand, the training gave him a crippling fear of <em>cats</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Shichika from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari">Katanagatari</a></em> spent his entire life training under his father to master Kyotoryuu on a deserted island. At the start of the series he has absolutely no knowledge of the outside world and can't even pick up the differences between other people. This seems to have been intentional on his father's part; a Kyotoryuu master is supposed to be a sword (not a swordsman) with no will of his own that someone else wields. Most of Shichika's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> has him realizing that he is still a human and has a will of his own. Another side effect of Shichika's training is that he is completely unable to wield swords. This becomes an issue in episode 9 since the owner of that episode's Deviant blade is a kendo master who refuses to duel Shichika unless he is also armed and armored. At the last episodes, we discover that this trope is exaggerated: Shichika was the last product of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a>, the Kyotouryuu, the No Sword School, that wants to create the perfect swordsman (a man so powerful that he doesnt need swords anymore), and he is the seventh generation of a school that had made the practicing of this martial art the principal motive of their lives. That means that Shichika is the last in line of five generations, each of them who were educated by a father who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining">Sacrificed Basic Skill for Awesome Training</a>, meaning each generation had more and more problems with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">social skills</a>.

Throw in the "absolute trust or complete mistrust, nothing in-between" bit and you've got a guy with a very weird form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>.
</li><li> Jin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> fits this to a T.

</li><li> A sadder example exists with the Oniwabanshu. Other than Aoshi, none of his four remaining comrades had any skills that were applicable in a new era. This coupled with their grotesque appearances meant that fighting was the only thing they were really capable of.

But due to a combination of this trope and being ostracised for her killing instincts, she can't function as anything other than an assassin who serves someone else. She doesn't even try to socialise with her classmates and instead spends her time trying to protect her master from (other) assassins. More comedically, she doesn't know how to do basic housework, trying to use her katana to cut grass for example.

Many also cannot interact meaningfully with anybody outside of Nazarick since they are seen as "lower lifeforms". This culminates in a character introduced in a later part of the work; a dragon who has spent so much of his time learning from books, he is obese, cannot fight well despite being a dragon and can only <em>barely</em> fly. His awesome skill? Knowing that pissing off that Overlord will mean <em>instant death</em>. Something that his relatives generally lack.

However, because he jumped into the High-Rank Job with such a low total level (the combined levels of all his known classes), he was able to learn a skill with a requirement made harder to earn at higher levels (Purifying Silverlight) and would require anyone else to reset every other job barring Paladin to 0 just to have a chance to learn it.

He addresses everybody as "Sir" no matter who they are, because that's all he knows. While waiting for orders, his entire platoon sits bolt-upright on their beds in the barracks doing absolutely nothing.

There's also Chad, arguably the best fighter in the class, whose every thought is focused on training to be the very best he can be.

</li><li> In the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> story, <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, it's said that Holmes has next to no practical knowledge that isn't related to detective work. He professes surprise when Watson tells him that Earth revolves around the sun (and states his intention to forget about it as best he can, so as not to fill up his mind with irrelevant information- comparing it to a 'brain attic', and information with furniture). This part of his character was quickly dropped by the author, as by <em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em>, Sherlock has quite a great deal of political knowledge (in contradiction to Watson's claim in <em>Scarlet</em> that Holmes' has a "feeble" grasp of politics), Holmes often peppers his speech with literature references, and, in any case, Holmes' ultimate career as a bee-keeper would suggest he's picked up the practical gardening knowledge that Watson claims he lacks. Then again, it's possible that this is the result of offstage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CradleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CradleSeries">Cradle Series</a></em>: Yerin was adopted by the Sword Sage when she was a child, becoming his disciple—despite Sages historically <em>never</em> taking disciples. He raised her to follow his Path in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts">sacred arts</a>, turning her into one of the most powerful sacred artists of her advancement level, and giving her a solid foundation to continue after he's gone. He didn't bother teaching her <em>anything</em> else, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLearnedToRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLearnedToRead">reading</a> to politics to geography. At the start of the story, she doesn't even know the name of the country she's in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Captain Carrot in was raised by dwarfs, so while he's quite apt at taking out threats, he doesn't get sarcasm or innuendo. Then again, neither do dwarfs (this is a cultural thing because dwarves live in relatively dangerous locations, so making sure everyone believes you when you say a cave-in is about to occur is a survival trait).
<ul><li> This is not to say he's incapable of guile or deception; he just does it in his own way. In one scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em>, he tells the head of the Fools' Guild that he has "special orders" he must follow if he is asked to leave (namely, that he must <em>accept</em> such a request), and insinuates that the consequences would be very bad for <em>someone</em> if he was forced to carry them out.
</li><li> He also admits quite honestly that he would feel "very ashamed" if forced to carry out his orders. This ability is something he developed after prolonged exposure to city life; when he first left the mountain, he was <em>absolutely</em> straightforward. Dwarves have also developed the ability to be quite sneaky at times and have a highly complex culture. Maybe it's just that Carrot was raised by uncomplicated country folk, and was also rather young when he first arrived in Ankh-Morpork.
</li></ul></li><li> Rincewind as well: he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, smart, but with few practical skills. This is largely because wizards aren't supposed to <em>have</em> any practical skills; they leave those to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnEqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnEqualRites">witches</a>.
<ul><li> Rincewind is an odd example of this trope as applied to <em>wizards</em>: having practically no capacity for magic whatsoever, he's had to become <em>much</em> more physically capable than your average wizard simply to survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">in a world that seems to be actively trying to kill him.</a> As a result, at the end of <em>The Light Fantastic</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he managed to defeat one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Things from the Dungeon Dimensions</a> - which was strong enough to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">petrify</a></em> several senior wizards - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">by punching it into submission.</a></em></span> He also solved the problem of the unstoppable Sourcerer, a fountainhead of magic, with a brick in a sock. He's not tough at all - just compared to most wizards, and has more importantly developed a talent for thinking in straight lines.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em> hangs a lampshade on the fact that society itself has done this when Ponder Stibbons' internal monologue defines a savage as someone who only knows useless and backwards things like how to tell an edible mushroom from a poisonous one, instead of important, civilized things like the square root of 27 (five and a bit)... while he's stranded on a deserted island with the rest of the wizards, who are equally civilized.
</li></ul></li><li> The children in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>, most notably the titular character, are separated from their families at a young age and placed in an orbiting military boarding school. The most promising, such as Ender and Bean, are intentionally isolated even from this small community by the teachers. The result are genius commanders who have little connection with their culture of origin and have no idea how to navigate typical social situations outside of a military command structure. Being geniuses, those who are motivated to do so can learn to fake it pretty easily, and most seem to adapt okay after a few years on the outside.
<ul><li> Hilariously alluded to in the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowOfTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowOfTheGiant">Shadow of the Giant</a></em> at a gathering of Ender's old jeesh of military super-geniuses.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"It was an analogy," said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Rackham</a>. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">If you hadn't spent your entire childhood playing war games</a>, you'd actually know something. You're all so uneducated."
</div><ul><li> It's established in the book that beyond commanding his Jeesh and working within a military context, Ender (and his brother Peter) <em>are</em> capable of understanding human emotions.... And use that knowledge to manipulate people for their own ends. Early in the book Ender <em>intentionally</em> engages in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">Troubling Unchildlike Behavior</a> to make sure some bullies leave him alone. His brother Peter, meanwhile, is an outright sociopath who uses his genius to go unnoticed as such by his parents.
</li></ul></li><li> Not so much a basic skill as cultural knowledge, but wizards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> are very ignorant of the world outside their community. For example, Hogwarts has to offer classes in basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a> technology and culture. Despite Hogsmeade being the only all-wizard community <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">in Britain</a>, most wizards are so self ostracized they can't function outside their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> without drawing attention to themselves. Even Arthur Weasley, who was <em>director of the Ministry office dealing with Misuse of Muggle Artefacts</em>, needed Harry's help to correctly pay a cashier with British pounds.
<ul><li> Also, in the first book, one of the obstacles defending the Philosopher's Stone is a logic riddle because, as Hermione puts it, "A lot of the greatest wizards don't have an ounce of logic in them, they'd be stuck here forever."
</li><li> Interestingly, as Harry and Hermione were raised by Muggles, they can be ignorant of wizard culture. For example, in the final book, they haven't heard of the tales of Beedle the Bard, which are fairy tales set in the wizarding world and which would be very familiar to magical youths, who to contrast wouldn't have heard of Cinderella and other Muggle mythology.
</li><li> Though given the increasingly small number of Pureblood wizards and the rising number of Muggleborn or half-Muggle children, it's mostly older wizards who are clueless. Many students and younger wizards are perfectly capable of passing for Muggle when they need to.
</li><li> We also only have a fairly small sample set when it comes to wizards in the wider world, and both the primary examples do have some sort of excuse: Hagrid's job probably keeps him in and around Hogwarts and the neighbouring village, so he wouldn't get a lot of practice. Arthur comes off as more than a little absent-minded (it's been speculated, with some good evidence, that he might be on the autistic spectrum) and his job heavily stresses the misuse part of Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, so he probably doesn't see a lot of mundane items in the first place.
</li><li> It's also a common criticism of the books that no mention is made of typical school curriculum taught at Hogwarts. Somewhat justified; History and Chemistry seem to be focused exclusively on the History of Magic and Potions, which would be the more important versions of the subject to a wizard, Physics has basically gone out the window, and Biology is split between Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. However, that also means that any Hogwarts student's Math, (Muggle) History, and Writing/English skills are pretty much capped off at the sixth grade. It's a wonder that any of them can do the complex conversions required for wizarding economics (though that might be covered by Arithmancy - and in any case, goblins run the wizarding economy), or the quite lengthy essays that are demanded of them by the Third year on.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Le Mort D'Arthur</em>, Lancelot says at one point that he's bad at climbing trees. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a></em>, a modern update, expands this to a general lack of all skills that children normally learn through play since he spent most of his childhood concentrating on his combat skills to the exclusion of all else.
</li><li> Kirth Gersen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemonPrinces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemonPrinces">The Demon Princes</a></em> series, much like Sosuke Sagara, has been focused primarily on combat since childhood; his social skills aren't <em>completely</em> missing, but he's pretty inept.
<ul><li> He had a different love-interest to one degree or another in each of the five books.

</li><li> Butler, on the other hand, <em>can</em> cook (to make sure no one poisons Artemis, presumably) and is ludicrously skilled in combat, but has very little ability to do anything creative, or things outside his training/orders.

"Why learn math when there are so many other important things to know in life? Like how to escape when attacked by three people at the same time."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> has a version of this with a one-off race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">aliens</a>. The "awesome training" is instant learning from nanobots, which are imprinted with the information by specially selected children who basically act as information harvesters. The children are filled with these nanobots, then tasked with learning everything there is to know about a specific topic. Once the child reaches a certain age, the nanobots are harvested and spread to every member of the society - leaving the child essentially mindless. Learning is painless and thorough, but because the kids their information comes from are treated as pure data-gathering units, they never learn things like play, with the result that no one else on the planet learns it either; the concept of drawing something that isn't an exact diagram is utterly foreign to them.
<ul><li> Later upped by the Ancient Repository of Knowledge. It writes everything there is to know about the universe into one's brain... but the human brain is not meant to store that much information, gradually overwriting things and eventually killing the subject when it starts mucking up low-level things. O'Neill was the only one who actually used it on-screen; it gave him insane scientific prowess, to the point that he invented a revolutionary new method of distance calculations between Stargates using base 8 math, and tweaked the battery of a handheld energy weapon into a one-use energy source of astronomical power... at the expense of losing his ability to speak, read or even understand English. Later comments by the Asgard imply that very few humans could have survived even that. Most would've just burned out in minutes or seconds.
<ul><li> Another Repository was used by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daniel Jackson, but according to all evidence this one had been specifically programmed to only give Daniel the knowledge of a specific Ancient, the man known to mythology as Merlin, and was also programmed to automatically depart Daniel after a certain amount of time</span>.

However, as he starts developing advanced powers such as telepathy and telekinesis, his brain starts losing the ability to regulate the more basic functions needed to keep his body alive, until it becomes a choice of "ascend or die".
</li></ul></li><li> Tom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em> is incredibly naive and socially awkward, due to having been raised in near-isolation from a young age by his adopted father. His lack of social graces are because all of his training was focused on managing his Lycanthropy and in hunting down and killing Vampires. Considering that Vampires have superior strength to humans, while Werewolves are regular individuals for most of the month, it's a testament to this training that Tom is able to go toe-to-toe with numerous Vampires and is said to have an incredible body count to his name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>, Michael mentions that spying is a great way to learn things like how to survive in the back mountains of Afghanistan, or how to disassemble a .50 caliber machinegun, but it doesn't teach you how to do more basic skills of normal life, like keeping track of sports teams or how to hold a baby. He's also fluent in many world languages... but can't say two words in Spanish (note: he was born in raised in Miami).
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> is a polymath forensic genius who has honed his memory and reasoning skills into precision weapons and spends his spare time researching things like what harpoon wounds look like. His knowledge of human interaction is limited to criminology and he's absolutely hopeless at navigating social situations. His older brother Mycroft is even more brilliant and even worse at emotional reasoning. As distinct from Doyle's "attic" metaphor, Sherlock speaks of it in terms of deleting unnecessary items from his hard drive.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Sherlock Holmes:</strong> Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister, or who's sleeping with whom—
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>John Watson:</strong> [somewhat bitterly] Or that the earth goes around the sun.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Sherlock Holmes:</strong> Oh God, that again?! It's not important!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>John Watson:</strong> Not important? It's primary school stuff! How can you not know that?
</div></li><li> Mostly averted with Sherlock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em>, who is just as smart but is able to navigate the social circles fairly well (for one, he has no trouble finding sexual partners, even engaging in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThreesomeFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThreesomeFantasy">Twin Threesome Fantasy</a> at one point). However, his main flaw is expecting everyone else to see things from a logical and not emotional standpoint, and he admits he can be a dick a lot of the time. After betraying Captain Gregson's trust, he thinks that Gregson is being immature when the captain no longer trusts him. Also, his idea of proving to his brother that Mycroft's fiancee is only interested in the family money is to repeatedly sleep with her. He does, however, spend a lot of time training and practicing, ignoring unnecessary little things like sleep.
<ul><li> Part of the reason Sherlock can cope on this level is that he's learned he doesn't have to specialise; where <em>Sherlock</em> seemed to basically keep track of everything he'd need to know for investigations on his own, in <em>Elementary</em> Sherlock has a group of experts- referred to as his 'Irregulars'- he can consult if a case requires specialised knowledge of particular subjects he wouldn't expect to deal with on a more regular basis (Mathematics, meteorology, computer hacking, etc.)
</li><li> As of Season 3, Watson has been trained to or close to his level of skill. It's worth noting that everyone in the show who's in his league (Holmes, Watson, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kitty</span>) are all profoundly hurt in some way, though Watson is otherwise fairly normal and Holmes was just as skilled <em>before</em> his major trauma. The one exception is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moriarty, who's just a sociopath.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>. In one episode Al trains Kelly to learn a bunch of sports trivia for a quiz show, and during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a> we see basic life skills (like "Dinner first, then sex") literally exiting her brain.
</li><li> When she showed up in Sunnydale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Kendra the Vampire Slayer</a> demonstrated the primary weakness of the Watcher's Council usual treatment of potential slayers (that is, they trained them to be living weapons above and beyond all other things). Kendra might have been a kick-ass fighter, for sure, but when it came to anything other than just hitting things, she was naïve, nervous about interacting with boys, had no dress sense, hesitant, and when push came to shove easily beaten by an enemy that did anything other than stand there and offer her a straight fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Legion2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Legion2017">Legion</a></em>: Kerry Loudermilk is an odd example. Kerry and Cary are actually a single mutant who have the ability to split into two people. Kerry (the girl) spends most of her time merged with Cary, where she doesn't age and can ignore the outside world completely. Since she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, she only comes out for training and fighting, leaving the "boring" stuff like eating, sleeping, school, and talking to Cary. The end result is that Cary's over forty years older than Kerry, and Kerry doesn't even know the most basic things about the world, like what people do in bathrooms. Cary is very worried about how she'll survive when he eventually dies.
</li><li> Lauren and Jayden in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em> were basically raised as weapons. Jayden has very little idea how to interact with people since he's only seen two since he was five and one of those left when he was seven. Lauren, bizarrely, is easy enough with the team but awkward around Jayden.

<ul><li> Practically a universal rule of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>: since the mechanics usually enforce some kind of balance on the game, creating a character who is exceedingly proficient at one thing (be it magic, sword-fighting, unarmed combat, whatever) will usually result in sub-par abilities elsewhere. It is all too easy to slip into the realm of "Min-Maxing", where a character contains a ridiculous number of weaknesses or quirks (usually applying to everything <em>but</em> their chosen skill) because each optional weakness taken provides precious character points for strengthening their one chosen skill.
<ul><li> This can backfire very badly, depending of course on the GM's level of personal evil and the style of the campaign; more specifically, the "min" part leaves a very obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfKryptonite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfKryptonite">Man of Kryptonite</a> situation open to a GM that's tired of your nonsense.
</li></ul></li><li> Games that use <a class="urllink" href="http://nc-gamers.com/pointbuy.aspx">Point Buy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for ability scores (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>) can fall into this. A player can maximise their chosen ability score but have so few points left that the rest of their ability scores are average at best.
</li><li> The Barbarian of pre-third edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, and is considered by some to be the best melee class. He has exactly 3 weaknesses: He has no resistance to magic whatsoever, he is illiterate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">and he isn't a spell caster</a>.
</li><li> Characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness">The World of Darkness</a></em> systems, especially those that are built toward combat, can often end up in this category — they still get raw attributes toward their rolls, but penalties can be insurmountable.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">Hunter: The Vigil</a></em>, this is a frequent issue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Slashers</a> have; many focused so much on learning to kill and murder people they actually lost basic social skills, making them unable to empathize or interact with people in a peaceful way.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> and possibly others: the starting skill value of 0 just means no special training (eg. 0 in a knowledge skill represents what a high school student knows).
<ul><li> The above-mentioned universal rule still looms, however. Players can take the "Incompetent" flaw, which means their character lacks even the common knowledge that might apply to the skill. Zero skill in driving means you can't be a stunt driver. Incompetent: Driving means you don't have a driver's license.
</li></ul></li><li> Several archetypes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em>, such as the Killer, the Techie and the Sorcerer, have no Martial Arts skill, with their only combat skills being in guns or sorcery, and thus have to default to Reflexes in order to do things that do not involve guns or sorcery that isn't covered by their other major skills.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, the Infernal Exalted have Charms that work like this — which makes sense, as their Charm trees are more about emulating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Yozi</a> who gave them their powers more than anything else. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Adorjan</a>, for instance, has Charms that allow the Exalted to block all social influence attempts — by turning all noise into wretched, hateful discord; or communicate telepathically — by losing the ability to vocalize anything but laughter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Kimbery</a>, meanwhile, has the Intolerable Burning Truths Charm, which covers a number of conditions the Infernal can buy into while at the same time losing the ability to do something else (such as making it easier to establish and protect an Intimacy to someone while losing the ability to hate someone for their betrayal).
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SavageWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SavageWorlds">Savage Worlds</a></em>: While it is possible to min-max to the moon and back, Savage Worlds introduced the "Common Knowledge"-roll as a way to get a reasonably well-rounded character without having to spend a whole slow of experience points on a number of vaguely useful knowledge skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Clan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Trueborns</a> are raised from birth to fight. Their training programs produce some of the best warriors, tacticians and (for the more prominent bloodlines) leaders around but other areas get neglected. Trueborns generally don't perform well in other fields if they don't have the civilian castes to back them up and this can often be a problem for anyone (that is, around 90%) who washes out of the warrior caste.
<ul><li> The RPG system also enforces this for characters; everything is purchased with experience. A special forces operative isn't going to have room for negotiating prowess after he's spent his experience points on stealth, demolitions and marksmanship skills.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>, a setting that depends heavily on diversifying skills and gives even most combat-related careers some non-combat skills for roleplaying reasons (for instance, mercenaries tend to be decent at gambling and haggling), the Troll Slayer has only three skills, of which one is only useful in a fight (Dodge Blow) and the two others generally useful for starting one (Intimidate, Consume Alcohol). Justified because Slayers are disgraced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seekers</a> who have put their past lives behind them to fight and die against a worthy enemy; you <em>cannot leave</em> the Slayer career once you start, except in death.
</li><li> The <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft">Spycraft</a></em> system, which runs primarily on skills and a skill-focus/proficiency system, hits this intentionally very, very hard. Not having full ranks in a skill places a flat cap on your total result, which can make advanced tasks literally impossible. Having no ranks in a skill lowers the cap to where it's barely possible to do basic tasks, and dramatically increases the likelihood of catastrophic failure. So players have to choose between extreme specialization and crippling mediocrity, with the first usually winning.
<ul><li> It's even worse with weapons, given that the non-proficient penalty to attacks is substantial and, for instance, the critical failure on a grenade is to pull the pin and drop it at your feet...
</li></ul></li><li> The rules for most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities">Prose Descriptive Qualities</a> games are explicitly written to avert it - anything you don't have a better rank in, you have automatically at Average [+0], which is general competence that anyone has. You might not be a gourmet chef if you don't take a cooking Quality, but you can at least boil water or cook meat without burning it. Though you can still hyper-specialize to your detriment by overlapping your Qualities as much as possible. In <em>Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies</em>, this may even be a good way to rack up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Training Points</a> quickly, by jumping in outside your area of expertise, because you only gain TP for failed rolls.

</li><li> Similarly largely averted in Fate-based games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, where a character who invests nothing in a skill generally still gets at least a Mediocre (+0) rank in it — meaning they can still roll for it, the skill just doesn't add anything to the dice — and it's not actually possible to lower this any further. In addition, because the skill system is pretty coarsely grained, most "regular" people will be only one or maybe two steps better than that in even their <em>trained</em> skills and likewise fall back to being Mediocre at everything else; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">player characters</a> and major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> are <em>already</em> awesome just by virtue of being able to have more trained skills including some beyond that cap right from the word go.
</li><li> There's a peculiar physical-combat-based example of this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AnimaBeyondFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AnimaBeyondFantasy">Anima: Beyond Fantasy</a></em> involving ditching buying any Attack (and if taken to a more extreme level, any Block/Dodge either) at all and instead sticking the points in Martial Knowledge, Ki Pool, and Ki Accumulation. As all of the above stats draw from the same pool of points, some of them have to be sacrificed, as trying to do all of them at once often falls into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> territory. This results in one of very few character builds that can use incredibly complex combinations of ki techniques — some of which can turn a character into the most devastating practical artillery pieces in the setting, or dish out damage per round that far exceeds the health of anything in the game — within a combat-practical time period, but without said techniques and the energy to power them, these characters are actually more prone to ineffective flailing than most <em>civilians</em>.
<ul><li> On a more general level, either hyper-focused secondary skill spreads (sacrificing any pretense of competence in basically anything else non-combat, or even anything combat-related if focused hard enough) that can quickly get up to physics-breaking levels in their one area of expertise at the cost of potentially fouling up <em>routine</em> checks outside that area (like taking stairs two or three at a time) on a fairly regular basis, or forgoing secondary skills entirely to spend the points on other things like extra maximum health or monster powers (which tend to be great for raw stats but not so much for life skills).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> is a partial aversion, with "defaults" for skills; for example someone who has put all their points into combat or magic and none into the Housekeeping skill has a "default skill level" of IQ-4, and can probably prepare basic meals and keep their living space in decent condition, right up until they get a bad roll and Something Goes Wrong. <em>Or</em> they can take an Incompetence disadvantage and squeeze some extra points into those combat abilities.

After being found with no memories, his parents refused to let him leave the manor. While he studied swordsmanship to pass the time, he was so ignorantly unaware of how the world outside worked that he bit into an apple without paying (an excuse for the tutorial on shopping) and was branded a thief for it. As well, despite his amazing ability to use the seventh fonon to create a hyperresonnance, he is also incapable of learning healing spells, which are the basic application of the seventh fonon.

On the other hand, you could also pick negative traits to give you additional attribute points. This allowed the wrestler to receive ungodly strength or endurance in exchange for being hampered by multiple <em>crippled limbs</em>. Happily, elective quadriplegia had almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">no effect whatsoever</a>, effectively granting you a massive power boost for free.

This is most prominent for Pokémon which evolve with evolutionary stones; though there are exceptions, either the evolved Pokémon can't learn any more moves by level-up and must rely on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TMs">T Ms</a> and Move Tutors (i.e. Raichu, Ninetales, Poliwrath), or their level-up learnsets are completely different from what the unevolved Pokémon can learn (i.e. Eevee's family).

The Greybeards have trained their voices to such an incredible extent that even a <em>misplaced whisper</em> could kill a person, thus they have to live in seclusion and rarely speak (with Arngeir, their human leader, being an exception).

When they speak in full voice to summon the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar, <em>all of Skyrim hears it</em>. Even when they greet the Dragonborn with a politely whispered "Dovahkiin", <em>the whole mountain shakes</em> from the force of it. It should be noted that this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamePlayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamePlayAndStoryIntegration">isn't just lore fluff</a>, the four Greybeards are some of the highest level-NPCs in the game, with Arngeir sitting pretty at level 150.
</li><li> This can be seen with min-maxed characters in many games, especially those games that receive new DLC or content patches: A character min-maxed for a specific build-type or playstyle can find itself completely out of its depth when new content comes about that changes the Meta or adds new mechanics, or patches exploits that once made specific builds unstoppable. Characters built around exploiting the current Meta end up completely out of their depth when the latest season begins, the latest DLC drops, or a patch comes in that completely changes the game, while characters built around overall versatility can typically do well (Clearing main game content, but suffering in the post-game content) no matter how much the Meta changes.
<ul><li> A good example of this can be seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls3">Dark Souls 3</a> when a fairly well-known patch came through and radically changed the Meta, removing many glitches and exploits that many players had been using to dominate player-versus-player combat. Characters built around using those glitches and exploits had to either respec or be completely abandoned. Additionally, characters built solely for PVP combat have a tendency to have difficulty clearing the game, while characters built around clearing the game tend to have issues with PVP combat.

He's a low-level fighter with stupidly high combat-related stats and abilities, but completely lacking in other abilities (and stats; it's quite obvious that he used both Wisdom and Intelligence as "dump stats"). He has sacrificed everything for maximum combat ability. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> version even sacrificed his ability to speak for more bonuses. The current list of Minmax's sacrificed skills includes starting fires, literacy, the ability to rhyme on purpose, the ability to wink, and even the skill to <em>dress himself</em>. Readers tend to find them out along with other characters when Minmax does something that should have been impossible; someone will look at him incredulously and say "How...?" and Minmax reveals what he traded for the ability just demonstrated. See the page image for one such event. Minmax knows 38 ways to kill a man with his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">thumb</a></em>, but doesn't know what chess is.

He lacks the ability to even speak to other characters (in-character anyway), but consequently his mechanical and hacking skills are through the roof. Bizarrely, this makes sense in-universe. Mech droids can't speak to humans specifically because they're over-optimized for their job of fixing things. Their "droidspeak" is much more efficient than human speech... for communicating with computers, so it's higher priority than being able to speak human languages.

Unfortunately, that means he doesn't know how to do things like use a can opener or do laundry. That would be fine, given how much money his family has, but then he gets kicked out of the family and disinherited... The relative pittance his family eventually basically bought him off with to avoid future trouble still makes him one of the richest kids at Whateley, and the same "financial wizard" training is helping him build on that even with him spending money left and right to simply <em>buy</em> even fairly exotic equipment at fair prices or hire competent help as needed. That said, the struggle between his refined palate and common cafeteria food (to say nothing of his shock at the first time he ever saw the inside of a common <em>supermarket</em>) remains fun to watch.

However, the rapid memory degradation that comes with Wyvern means that he can only <em>maintain</em> these skills with constant practice at the cost of his other skills.

</li></ul></li><li> This is actually the point of the first three seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>. Twilight Sparkle is the personal apprentice of Princess Celestia and is a wildly powerful and talented magic-user in her own right, but she has almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> because she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarky</a> introvert who spends too much time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm">studying</a>. Celestia takes it upon herself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">do something about this before it's too late</a>, with Twilight learning various friendship lessons and reporting them to Celestia being a framing device for those initial seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> does this a bit. On one level, there's the Crystal Gems. They are millennia-old protectors of Earth, and are very good at that job, until Steven's father Greg entered an actual romantic relationship with their leader, they never felt a need to actually <em>interact</em> with humans or study what it has to offer on a regular basis; they suck at both human interaction (less so talking with them as it is treating them with respect when doing so) and understanding human cultures. On another, the caste system of the species means that pretty much every Gem is like this when it comes to things that fall outside what they were specifically created for (such as Peridot, whose Gem type is dedicated solely to engineering).
<ul><li> Peridot is probably the best example in the series, as in addition to being completely new to Earth, her dedication to her work means that she also completely lacks the social skills that even other Gems have. So her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">redemption arc</a> has her both struggling to understand how to process the emotions of herself and others on top of adapting to things like "rain" and "teen dramas".
</li></ul></li><li> The Daughters of Aku introduced in Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> are a team of deadly assassins born and raised for the sole purpose of killing Jack. All of that training came at the expense of basically any knowledge of the outside world. They don't even know what a <em>deer</em> is and are completely baffled (and upset) by displays of affection. It gets all but one of them killed.
</li><li> Webby Vanderquack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em> was raised by an overprotective grandmother who is also a retired superspy. As a result, she has been trained in martial arts, stealth, and other skills that serve her well when she's on adventures with Scrooge McDuck and the triplets, but has been sheltered in McDuck Manor all her life so she's never had any exposure to anyone her own age or related activities. The second episode, "Daytrip of Doom!", has this on full display as Webby goes with Huey, Dewey, and Louie to the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckECheeses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckECheeses">Suck E. Cheese's</a> and doesn't know what some of the attractions even <em>are</em>, but later single-handedly captures Ma Beagle in the ball pit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>: Adora is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByOrcs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByOrcs">raised from infancy to be a soldier of the Horde</a>, meaning she's a fantastic fighter and tactician. The tradeoff is that she has no understanding of things that aren't military, like horses, parties, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrefersRocksToPillows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrefersRocksToPillows">soft beds</a>, or the concept of aunts. When invited to a prom, she prepares like she's planning to invade a country. Notably, this is limited to Adora. The rest of the squad she grew up with are fully aware of these things, even if they never got to experience some of them; the aforementioned prom example has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend">Evil Former Friend</a> be aware that its simply a fancy social event without it having to be explained to her.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Unfortunately, this is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">child prodigies</a> tend to practice and allocate all their resources on their skills so often that they neglect some very basic aspects on growth into a fully socialized person. This is particularly true in regions or education programs that focus on good grades and high test scores, such as the Advanced Placement system, as they spend almost all of their time teaching students how to do well academically. In more intense cases, the time that students normally spend socializing, like during lunch or after school, is taken up by further studying. It has become an issue as of the 2010s, with growing awareness of people graduating from universities with <em>no idea</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat">what to do next,</a> as they were only taught how to receive that degree without being told what to do with it or what employers want.
</li><li> This is also why education has almost eliminated grade skipping in recent years, as the 10 year olds graduating college found themselves unemployable, over-educated, with no social or "soft" skills, and no way to gain those skills, as they had no peers with which to interact.
</li><li> Big business college athletics in the United States has been noted as suffering from this, especially with the presence of sports scholarships in some universities leading to cases of players able to get, essentially, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADegreeInUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADegreeInUseless">joke degrees that have no practical benefit to them</a>. If players then manage to make it into professional ranks at some point when they're forced to retire many realize they have no useful skills outside of the sport. This is often exacerbated by the effect of fame and fans so their ability to socialize like a normal person when they're no longer the center of attention can be hampered. Many professional leagues now offer, essentially, life-skills classes and support so ex-athletes can manage to survive off the field. There are also efforts to clamp down on the fake athletic degrees so the college athletes have at least some kind of a real education.
</li><li> Some argue that the Autism Spectrum Disorder is just an exaggerated example of this, reasoning that the person sacrificed social skills for their "special interests". Some autistics would agree but put it another way: that socializing is simply the neurotypical "special interest", and that to autistics themselves, other children were/are simply not interesting.
</li><li> This is sometimes the case with musicians who received formal educations at Berklee or similarly prestigious institutions and then attempt to start or join bands with no formal band experience. They generally have all the technical knowledge and ability in the world, but they also frequently have no idea how to write a full-fledged song that sticks with the listener, an overly sterile and robotic feel because they never really developed one on their own (you can't exactly teach feel, after all), and no idea how to function in a band setting, which often leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">frequent turnover</a> if they're the leader (as they often wind up being difficult to work with and/or are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">egotistical assholes</a>) and a steady stream of ejections if they're not (as they frequently try to take control of the band or just have trouble working with others in general).
</li><li> In some species of termites, soldiers have powerful jaws, toxins, or even the ability to squirt glue at predators that attack the colony. This comes at the expense of being able to feed themselves — they require workers to feed them.
</li><li> Extremely advanced degree programs (learning how to be a specialist doctor, for example) sometimes erode away any social skills an aspiring doctor had built up at that point, due to spending 20 hours a day, every day, for 6-8 years studying biology, medicine, and human physiology.
</li><li> Racing Thoroughbred horses are among the fastest breeds in the world, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">an incredibly rigid schedule to get them that way.</a> They spend the vast majority of the day in their stall, with their only outdoors time being at the track, training for the track, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">at the vet to make sure they're still healthy enough for the track,</a> so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained">rejected</a> horses take off at a gallop on anything <em>remotely</em> resembling a racetrack, and often just in the presence of other horses, because that's the only time they meet. The first thing that owners of ex-racehorses need to teach them is how to socialize without competing, and the second is basic riding cues that most grown horses know as a foundation for <em>every</em> other riding discipline. Like "slow down," or "turn left/right."
<ul><li> Many vets have noted that the immense training both shortens their lifespans <em>and</em> quality of life. Most horses reach their prime at six or eight years old and live well into their twenties or thirties, but a professional racehorse is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron">retired at 6-8 years</a> if they're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">outright euthanized for health issues.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Toughening your knuckles is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> if you want to be a fighter. That said, the sacrifice comes if you toughen them too much, to the point where it's difficult to write (since finger dexterity is reliant on cartilage inside the joints of the hands, some of these being the knuckles).
