<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first issue back in the 1930s, our titular hero deals with a violent husband by throwing him into a wall and mercilessly beating <em>him</em> (as delightfully pictured above) until he promises to never hit his wife again. This scenario is revisited in the Golden Age reality that Superman was subjected to in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDominusEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDominusEffect">The Dominus Effect</a></em>.
</li><li> He faces a similar situation in the Nineties, but since he'd become much, much stronger in the interim — to the point that any real beating would have killed the abusive husband in question — he had to handle the situation a bit more carefully. Not just that he was stronger — in a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>, we had a flashback to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> version of the above scene, and <em>it doesn't solve the problem</em>. The woman refuses to press charges and takes her husband back, and the next time he gets violent, he kills her. Clark, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">being Clark</a>, wonders if the humiliation of being beaten himself was what triggered this. So, when Clark suspected that another woman was getting roughed up like that, he hesitated to intervene for fear of making things worse. However, when in a chance encounter the woman screamed for help, then Clark was perfectly free to intervene, starting by smashing a locked door to her to splinters with one kick to rescue her while Lois called family services for appropriate qualified professionals to deal with the situation.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> <em>Action Comics #1</em> mentions Superman having done this as well in his early years as a hero, though we don't see it on panel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In this case, the abusive husband in question eventually becomes a Kryptonite-powered supervillain and comes back seeking revenge on Superman.</span>
</li><li> Turns out its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice2019">2019 Young Justice series</a> shows Connor Kent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> saving a pregnant peasant woman named Lophi in Gemworld from being harassed by guards when it looks like they were going to manhandle her. When one tries to antagonize him, he just catches his arm and <em>crushes</em> his fist without batting an eye. Lophi takes him in while he waits for his friend and Connor poses as her husband (her old one died in a war) until Young Justice arrives. The two have grown close enough for Lophi to let Connor name her daughter, which he named Martha, after Ma Kent.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Within the first few issues of the New 52 reboot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook">Comic Book</a>/Aquaman</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mera">Mera</a> does this to a man who just murdered his wife by almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">dehydrating him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">to death</a>, only to be stopped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">the man's daughter</a>.
</li><li> Really, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">an expected attribute</a> of the most loved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> heroes such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>. What differs the last two from the first, is that they're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillerKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillerKiller">killers</a>.
<ul><li> In the Rick Remender run, it was revealed that Steve's mother Sarah Rogers was beaten by her alcoholic husband who was suffering from PTSD. This seems to have played a part in his hatred for bullies, wife beaters in particular.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">Ultimate Captain America</a> is particularly notable. After Ant-Man and the Wasp had a verbal fight that escalated and they attacked each other (he "won"), almost no one wanted to listen to his side of the story. However, he didn't simply beat her; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">he very nearly killed her by siccing an army of ants on her after she had shrunk down to wasp size</a>. Cap, with his '50s values, tracks him down to a bar in Chicago and beats the crap out of him even when Hank Pym is <em>50 feet tall</em>. Even more badass was that Cap actively goaded Pym into changing size so he'd actually have a challenge (as opposed to beating on a depressed and drunk scientist who has hit rock bottom). Presumably, since the Ultimates don't want the bad publicity, and it involved national security matters, Cap is never charged.
</li><li> Marvel Knights' <em>4</em> did this, with Sue Storm threatening an abusive husband.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>'s occasional foe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Cardiac</a> usually doesn't concern himself with this kind of criminal (as a vigilante, his goal is to punish people who hurt others and do horrendous things but use legal loopholes and technicalities to escape justice). However, in one issue, while he is staking out a place, he sees a man assault his wife in a nearby apartment, and decides he can't "in clear conscience", let it happen. (Unfortunately, while he is teaching the wife-beater a lesson, it gave his true target more of a head start than he'd have liked.)
</li><li> It's been implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">the psychological origin</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> was young Bruce Banner witnessing his father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">beating his mother</a> and wanting to be one of these; rather notable, given that one of the more consistently heroic portrayals of the Hulk (namely, the dim-witted but extremely powerful Savage Hulk) is essentially a child in the same frame of mind as young Banner.
</li><li> Marv of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> does not like it when guys rough up girls. At all. His response to a frat boy beating up his favorite stripper Nancy is to "straighten him out but good," mentioning that maybe he went a little too far (which implies that he beat the guy to death). In <em>A Dame to Kill For</em>, Dwight plays upon this in order to recruit Marv for the "rescue mission" of Ava, which he feels rather rotten for as he's doing it. Unfortunately, it's later learned that Ava, the dame of the title, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">playing Dwight's own violent protectiveness of women like a two-bit fiddle</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em> has a strange case: the titular protagonist is disgusted by wife bashers but doesn't care enough to punish them, but Eva does, and he'll gladly help her robbing them blind and closing them in their own secret vault (just to quote the most recent case at the time of the writing).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Jason Todd, the second Robin</a>, hated seeing women getting beaten by their abusive husbands and boyfriends; if he witnessed this, he would beat the abuser within an inch of his life. In one story, he may have actually killed the abuser, because he was furious that the man drove his girlfriend to suicide and he got away with it because he was the son of a diplomat; so one night, he confronted him, and by the time Batman arrived, the man had fallen to his death. Jason denied any wrongdoing.
</li><li> When the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> were sent back in time to 1907, Karolina discovered that one of the kids whom the team had rescued from a factory fire was living with an abusive old alcoholic. She later discovered that the poor girl, who was 11 years old, was, in fact, <em>married</em> to the bastard, and that he had fully claimed his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">marital rights</a>". They ultimately managed to extract the girl and take her back to the present, and thus it was not necessary to beat the old man's ass, but she <em>really</em> wanted to, especially after Klara showed up to the Leapfrog covered in bruises.
<div class="indent"><strong>Karolina</strong>: I know who did this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">And I know where he lives</a>.</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X-23</a></em> pulls a variation of this with prostitutes. Sometime before joining the X-Men, Laura spent time on the streets of New York as a child prostitute under a sadistic and violently abusive pimp named Zebra Daddy. As a result of her experiences, on several occasions afterwards, she's been shown reacting <em>very</em> violently to seeing other girls in the same situations: During her one-shot, she stumbled across a pimp abusing one of his girls, and unceremoniously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">beheaded him</a> with her claws, while the "Songs of the Orphan Child" arc of her ongoing began when Laura went after a man who murdered a teen prostitute she met at a diner. Most notably, when a girl's night out with Jubilee near the end of the series revealed that members of Zebra Daddy's gang had taken over his business, the evening turned into a bloody rampage to liberate the girls they were trafficking. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a> herself, who arrived to clean things up afterward and help see the rescued girls were taken care of, noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Laura was acting entirely out of rage and not thinking clearly</a> during the fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a></em> (2016) features Aneka and Ayo, the Midnight Angels. Aneka killed a tribal chieftain who had been sexually abusing girls in his village. Later, Aneka and Ayo slaughter a group of militants who had been kidnapping women and girls for use as sex slaves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em>: One issue sees Frank tailing a pair of cops, one of them crooked. The other one has a drinking problem (caused in part by his partner being crooked), but Frank doesn't really this as a problem... until the cop's wife comes in the room and he starts beating her. It takes considerable effort to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">Perpetual Frowner</a> to look <em>really</em> angry, but the cop manages it. We next see him at the woman's shelter his wife ran off to, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">being hoisted in the air by Frank.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMax">The Punisher MAX</a></em> has an unintentional example: Frank starts the series by conducting a massacre of assembled Mafiosi. During the Widowmaker arc (where their widows unite to get revenge on him), a young woman who used to be married to one of them (a rapist, wifebeater and murderer) thanks him for taking out her husband (the flashback panel shows Frank casually shotgunning the guy's head as he lies on the ground without even looking), and kills the rest of the widows for him (as they were responsible for setting up the wedding in the first place, then trying to kill her when she wanted out).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2006">Wonder Woman (2006)</a></em> Diana does not take it easy on the retired supervillain who had just decided to upgrade his usual mistreatment of his wife into beating her to near death for calling the cops. He turns his battered self in when the cops arrive, even though Wondy had long since left to get his wife aid.
<ul><li> Wonder Woman also did this a few years earlier, albeit in a dream scenario where she and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> became a couple, and in one situation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">cuts the hand</a> off of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuser</a>.

The corporal gets to his feet and snaps at Carey that it's nobody's business but ends up pinned to the wall with Carey's forearm across his throat, whereupon Carey issues the ultimatum that neither the stockade, loss of rank, or loss of retirement will stop him from destroying the man in place.

Before his death, he had been keeping a close eye on a family of three, which included giving free brushes to the wife of the family, Diane, and playing baseball with the son of the family, Kevin. This arouses the suspicion of the father of the family, Glenn, who Roy distrusts. Glenn makes Roy take back the brushes he gave Diane and tries to keep his son away from him. Roy later finds Diane crying and comforts her; Diane is upset because her husband mistreats and lies to her, saying he is at work when he is not. Kevin sees Roy and his mother and runs off; Roy goes after him to make sure he did not get the wrong impression. Kevin tells Roy that he had caught his father cottaging in the park and that he had had his wrist broken as 'punishment.' This angers the wife-basher basher Roy, who finds Glenn in his work-shop at night. Roy adopts a threatening tone and tells Glenn to leave his family and let them live their life. Glenn insists that Roy has no right to intrude on his 'family life' and that he will never leave. Roy than tells Glenn that he knows about his homosexuality and Glenn becomes more hesitant, but still reiterates that he will not leave.

</li><li> Another episode has a cop as the abusive spouse to his wife, with the abuse starting to extend to his four-year-old twin girls. A rookie cop found out about it and, after falling in love with and proposing to the wife, gave the cop a preliminary beatdown with a warning to leave the wife he was abusing and stop beating up his little girls. He mentions "That's how we dealt with abusers back then. Off the books." Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the rookie, the wife and daughters (who he believed were safe at his house) had gone back to their old house to rescue a pet, and when the husband found him there, he took out his frustrations on them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The wife tried to talk him down, but the twins (being too young to fully understand) innocently let slip that their mother was planning to marry someone else, leading to a standoff in which he kills one of the girls.

The cop ended up dead in a firefight some months later, and the rookie (now an old man) all but admits he shot the guy himself in the chaos.

</li><li> A variation in the fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>: The Child Basher Basher. When Dexter discovers that a friend of his stepdaughter is being abused by her mother's boyfriend, he immediately takes action.

He then tells him to get out, STAT, and never come back.

He says he learned two things that day: that every man can lose it sometimes and that whatever happens between a man and a woman is no one else's business.

The partner doesn't say much, but later in the episode, the cop himself is brought into the ER, accompanied by the partner and several other police officers. When Benton asks what happened, the partner claims that the man fell down a flight of stairs while they were pursuing a suspect, but the strong implication is that he and the other cops took the guy somewhere and beat the crap out of him.

Unfortunately, he's a cop, and she overestimates her own skill level compared to his, so she ends up getting the worse beatdown. However, he can't resist taunting her as he's attacking her, including telling her exactly how he's going to kill her and claim self-defense, and an SRU microphone picks this up, so his self-defense argument falls flat and the episode ends with him getting arrested as his wife stares him down defiantly.

The viewers also find out that her husband Joe is a Klaustreich (a cat-like Wesen who are known to be jerks). At the end of the episode, Joe breaks into Nick and Juliette's place and attacks the women. To everyone's surprise, it's Juliette who turns out to fit this trope, beating the crap out of the guy even after he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">full woge</a> on her. Only after he's down does Nick come in with his gun, scaring Joe with the realization that Nick is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">Grimm</a>, whereas before he didn't care that Nick was a cop. Presumably, just the threat of Alicia's best friend living with a Grimm is enough to keep Joe away from her.

He's also not very fond of Albert Conaghan, the serial rapist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> whose sick pastime is likely what got him the attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Tall, Dark, and Faceless himself</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> is known to do this with his gun, even trying to shoot Lady Tremaine for abusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> so much.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>, the spinach-eating sailor, is notorious for walloping Bluto whenever the big guy makes one move too many on Olive Oyl, which is in nearly every cartoon. Olive may be often receptive to Bluto's aggressive flirting, but she still doesn't deserve to be forced into anything if she changes her mind about it. Popeye kind of blunders into this one; he's generally ready to beat the tar out of Bluto when he starts putting the moves on Olive, but he only holds off because she'd be mad at him — or, often as not, he doesn't hold off, and she gets mad at him. Still, because he's Bluto, it doesn't matter that he's successfully charmed her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">eventually he starts getting rough with her</a>, which means Popeye is free and clear to open up a can of... spinach.
</li><li> Glenn Quagmire becomes this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E3ScreamsOfSilenceTheStoryOfBrendaQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E3ScreamsOfSilenceTheStoryOfBrendaQ">"Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q"</a> in regards to him willing to murder his sister's abusive boyfriend. Joe (a police officer) allows him to do it after seeing the abuse for himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Adrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Adrian">Adrian</a></em> has the titular protagonist (an expy/avatar/self-insert of the author, the actor and singer Adriano Celentano) don the mask of "La Volpe" (<em>The Fox</em>), a Zorro/Batman expy stalking the streets of a corrupt Milano beating rapist and wifebeaters until they become crippled messes of scarred flesh, broken bones and open fractures. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>: Adrian believes he's tasked to protect every kind of beauty from every kind of predatory exploitation, and that women are the ultimate avatar of the abstract concept of beauty. Defiling a woman to Adrian means defiling beauty itself, and he can't allow that.
<ul><li> Also, Adrian fits this trope to a capital T, being usually an easygoing, peace-loving, jolly fellow spreading smiles and good will. Until someone is defiling a woman in front of his eyes. Then everything gets worse.
