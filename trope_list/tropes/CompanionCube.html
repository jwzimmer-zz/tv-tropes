Sometimes, the object blurs the line between real and imaginary by apparently doing things which would be hard for an inanimate object to do or telling people things they shouldn't have been able to already know, but the defining characteristic is that we the audience never, ever see it move of its own volition on camera, even if it clearly must've done something.
</p><p>For some reason, Companion Cubes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential">tend to become very popular</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">with the audience</a>. Something to do with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a>, probably. Or simply because the idea of having an inanimate object being a character is funny. Or maybe because it's easy to project the best traits you can think of onto the object. Or because you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler">make yourself a replica at home</a>...
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Dolls and teddy bears are especially common examples, probably because they're humanoid, friendly looking, and meant to be bonded with. Typically the owner will treat it as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant">Confidant</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">Security Blankets</a> are also common in this regard. Which brings to mind little kids with their favourite companion since it is often the trait of a childlike character. If the character isn't acting childishly in general and the object isn't showing any signs of being anything more than an object whatsoever, then it becomes a darker sign of a seriously disturbed character.
</p><p>If a character gives a weapon this treatment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">expect him or her to give it a name</a>.
</p><p>This can go wrong in fandom. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip">Horribly, horribly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">wrong.</a>
</p><p>This can also be used to show how insane a character is. In this case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsultingMisterPuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsultingMisterPuppet">they may talk to it for advice</a>.

Sweet dreams!

Appropriately, the trope is lampshaded when a spokesman chastises the audience for feeling sorry for an inanimate object.
</li><li> Geico's "money you saved from using Geico" which is a stack of money with eyes. They have been known to do things off camera like texting.
</li><li> One commercial for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/SeattleMariners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/SeattleMariners">Seattle Mariners</a> baseball team showed designated hitter Edgar Martinez treating his bat this way, hanging out with it in the park, taking it for car rides (buckling it into the passenger seat), and even bringing it to a massage parlor.

<ul><li> Seems to be quite common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series. Usually it starts with the pilot pleading with the Gundam to keep going during an especially tough battle, but in can escalate to them asking the machine for advice and then acting like advice has been given. Particularly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Gundam Wing</a></em>, all of the characters who pilot Gundams will talk to their machines at least once every couple of fights. In an early episode,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Quatre's about to blow up his own Gundam, Sandrock, the cockpit opens by itself, causing Quatre to wonder: "Are you telling me to get down, Sandrock?"</span> A few of the suits also have the ZERO system, which tends to inspire insanity in the pilots who use it. That sure doesn't help.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>, Sosuke was coaching the lousy school rugby team. He made them go through physical and mental training from hell. At the end of the training, he gave each of them a football and made them assign female names to them. Cut to one of the football players caressing his ball saying, "Don't worry, baby. I won't be rough. I won't hurt you" with a mentally disturbing smile and crazy eyes.

<ul><li> In the earlier parts of the Golden Age Arc, we see Guts as a child being taught how to use a sword. He uses a two handed blade which is considerably oversized for a kid. We later see him hugging that sword like a teddy bear while he's going to sleep. Considering that he was raised in a mercenary band, blamed for the death of the only mother figure he ever had, and the abuse he suffered from the guy he considered a father figure, it's not too far fetched to believe that for Guts the sword <em>was</em> his only friend at that time. <br/><br/> Guts is often visibly shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">having trouble sleeping without a sword</a> and claims he can't relax without it on hand. Considering the dangers he faces this concern is probably for more practical reasons, but who's to say whether the possible emotional and practical reasons can't complement each other?
</li><li> Played for laughs with Puck and the Behelit Guts carries around. Despite being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>, he affectionately calls it "Betchi."

She gives it a name, sleeps with it, and dresses it up. The only reason she went with it was because it was "cute". Yui's never been totally right in the head to begin with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SumomoMoMomoMo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SumomoMoMomoMo">Sumomo Mo Momo Mo</a></em>, Tenka has a soccer ball that he named Becky.

<ul><li> Something of a subversion with the Soul Reapers' Zanpakuto swords. Each sword is part of the Soul Reaper's being, but also has its own spirit and name. We rarely see a Zanpakuto's spirit (Ichigo's Zangetsu usually only speaks to him in his own mindscape, and Renji's Zabimaru only appears a couple times), but all the principle Soul Reapers have learned their swords' names. While the swords are rarely treated as characters, in one episode Yumichika gets so mad at his he beats it against a rock. Rangiku's sword kind of rubs her the wrong way, too.
</li><li> Any remaining elements of this are thoroughly thrown out the window in one the anime's filler arcs, where all the Zanpakutou spirits are materialized in humanoid forms and wreaking havoc.
<ul><li> In the same arc, the Zanpakuto are given even more human traits; like Yumichika's Fuji Kujaku refusing to reveal its true power because <em>it feels insulted</em> when he calls it that. (For reference, its actual name is Ruri'iro Kujaku.)
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in a newer arc in which having a companion cube causes it to have certain powers. Such as a dollhouse which lets you trap people inside of it or boots that make your kicks increasingly lethal as they get dirty.

<ul><li> Pikachu is shown with a bottle of ketchup even earlier than that, during the third episode of <em>Advance Generation</em>.

If his glasses are removed, it's practically guaranteed that everyone in the vicinity will start paying attention to them instead of him. It's actually worked to his advantage on a few occasions, allowing him to escape notice from enemies and sparing him from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">genderbending</a> satellite (It only targeted his glasses, which turned pink), though he complains about it regardless.

He believes his grandfather's spirit resides within it, going as far as calling it grandpa at several points, and is very protective of it. He refused to give it to Bulma, which is how he ended up going on a quest with her, and the most of the Red Ribbon Army Sage revolves around him looking for it.

<ul><li> Kinto'un, or Flying Nimbus as it's called in the English dub, also gets this treatment. While being a magic cloud it doesn't appear to be any sort of living, thinking creature, but Goku still often talks to and treats it like it was one of another one of his friends. In the manga, the only time it is shown to have a reaction SFX is when Gohan has a race contest against it.

This made Wesker a rather tragic villain, because his core personality is mild-mannered and doesn't like what Scarface is doing or the abuse Scarface heaps on him, but cannot seem to break with the idea that he and Scarface are separate individuals. In one instance, Wesker actually shoots Scarface while the dummy is still on his hand, then proceeds to not notice that his hand is bleeding.

</li><li> In the Danish comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valhalla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valhalla">Valhalla</a></em>, Thor has a tendency to treat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mjollnir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mjollnir">Mjollnir</a> as a pet rather than a weapon; this is most evident in the second album, when the hammer is stolen by Thrym, and Thor is close to panic because the hammer "isn't used to being alone." Of course, Mjollnir is a magical hammer, and on one or two occasions does display something resembling sentience (like when Thor tries to throw it at the Fenris Wolf, and the hammer turns around in mid-air and flies back to Thor rather than face the open jaws of the wolf).
</li><li> One of Bill Maudlin's most famous <em>Up Front</em> cartoons is of a cavalry sergeant about to mercy kill his mount... a jeep with a broken axle.

</li><li> The third incarnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> villain Clayface was in love with Helena, a cheerful blonde... mannequin. In his first appearance there's a creepy yet humorous moment where he says he would have gone insane if he hadn't met her. Batman seems sympathetic by the second time they met: he pulled strings so Clayface could keep Helena in his cell at Arkham. By then, though, the spark in their relationship was gone and Clayface kinda wanted a divorce.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Mafalda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Mafalda">Mafalda</a></em>: Mafalda often makes sarcastic comments to her terrestrial globe — once even tucking it in bed and acting as if it's sick! It's a tad deeper than most examples seeing as she talks to it as a stand in for the world. It can get quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> sometimes, such as in the "sick" example. The poor thing has frequent sharp pains in its democracy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hobbes, depending on your interpretation. Aside from Calvin, the characters treat Hobbes as inanimate (though Susie has occasionally interacted with Hobbes similar to how Calvin does). When Calvin's mom laundered Hobbes, he stumbled around a bit after coming out of the drier. The creator of the strip, Bill Watterson, has stated that he does not believe Hobbes is either truly alive <em>or</em> a Companion Cube — and as there is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> saying otherwise, it seems that Hobbes' Companion Cube status is entirely dependent on the reader of the comics.
</li><li> On occasion, Susie treats Mr. Bun, who is always depicted as a stuffed rabbit, as real. And Hobbes is at one point disturbed by the fact that Mr. Bun appears to be in a coma. Susie plays with toys like a normal child — Calvin brings the nature of reality in the comic into question. (Not an exaggeration. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states there will never be an official explanation regarding Hobbes's nature.)
</li><li> Calvin's evil bicycle ambushed and assaulted him several times.
</li><li> The television in Calvin's house has occasionally had thought bubbles of its own, which no-one else seems to notice.
</li></ul></li><li> Quincy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em>, despite being a live iguana, fits this trope perfectly. When Jason uses Quincy (and some old clothes) as part of a "Lone Iguana" persona, the effect is that of a guest character.
</li><li> In one storyline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MyCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MyCage">My Cage</a></em>, Norm, the main character spent a week out sick, but no one noticed, as his secretary placed a potted plant with a face and the word "Norm" drawn on the pot at his desk instead. The plant later showed up as a member of the company's softball team.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em>:
<ul><li> Linus's security blanket, but not exactly to Linus himself. In one week-long sequence, Lucy became convinced The Blanket had sentience and was out to get her, refusing to be in the house alone with it. One strip even shows The Blanket leaping from Linus' hands to pounce on Lucy. No one else witnessed anything of the sort; as Charlie Brown commented during the riff, "I never thought she would be the first of us to crack." (Interestingly, this was the only sequence of Schulz's strips ever to be rejected by his syndicate. They have turned up in collections, but never had a newspaper "first run.")
</li><li> Sally used to have conversations with the school building (or at least one wall of it). Eventually, the wall began to produce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechBubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechBubble">thought balloons</a> expressing opinions and making observations on life and its philosophical approach to wall-ness, while occasionally dropping bricks on the heads of people he didn't like. (When the building collapsed, Sally interpreted this as the school "committing suicide.") Occasionally Charlie Brown's pitcher's mound would have thoughts and opinions as well.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em>'s teddy bear, Pooky.

When it's growling, Sarge often treats this as a verbal demand for food, sometimes talking to it as if it were his best buddy and sometimes arguing with it.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> strip, a woman had a baby that looked like a loaf of bread, which turned out to be an actual loaf of bread.

Zip is described like a living sentient life form with a personality of its own and not as a vehicle that is ridden from one place to another.

Despite his age and third-hand ownership, Oliver survived a one-thousand mile cross-country trip straight across the spine of Botswana, including the entirety of the Makgadikgadi Pan, the largest salt flat in the world.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBean">Mr. Bean</a></em>'s Teddy, and to some extent his car. Much of the humour comes from the inconsistent way in how he treats them — one minute gently lowering Teddy into his own miniature bed, the next absent-mindedly ripping his head off so he'll fit in the drawer. Then when his car gets run over by a tank, he kneels down in front of the wreckage as sad music plays — only to retrieve the lock and seem perfectly happy with this.

</li><li> The Impala (known to fans as Metallicar) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> is considered by some to be the third main character. It features prominently throughout the series, and Dean is occasionally found to be whispering sweet nothings to it. Chuck the prophet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who is heavily implied to actually be God</span> outright calls it the most important object in the universe.

She seems to share a psychic connection with it, sometimes dispensing advice and visions that she claims come from the log itself. At one point she insists that Agent Cooper direct a question to the log instead of her. It's left ambiguous as to whether the log has any intelligence, but the Log Lady seems to have some otherworldly insight, and Hawk states that it "holds many spirits." The log's size and shape subtly evoke a baby, with two small nubs on the upper section where the baby's arms would be.

While it's initially taken as a sign of how distant she has become to Rory, a younger version of herself is able to remind her that it's actually because Rory is the love of her life.
</li><li> In "The Time of the Doctor", the Doctor owns a battle-worn Cyberman head, which he calls "Handles". He can talk and presents helpful information, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> including decrypting a Gallifreyan code</span> and lives with the eleventh Doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until his, and the eleventh Doctor's, demise</span>.

Originally Chuck was only supposed to be a temporary character but he and Bob were so popular that the writers had to keep them. It gets to the point where all but a few of the characters forget Bob isn't a separate person, the audience will always refer to Bob as a separate character as well. All of the characters dislike Bob because of his rude behavior but like Chuck because he's very well-mannered (the except is Benson as he's one of the few sane ones; Mary, while sane, just considers Chuck as troubled).

<ul><li> The Adeptus Mechanicus "Machine Cult" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> treat <em>all</em> machines as if they contain sentient "machine spirits". Interestingly, <em>actual</em> artificial intelligences are considered anathema by the Cult Mechanicus, as it's believed that "thinking machines" nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">destroyed humanity at one point</a>.
<ul><li> Though, it is notable that Titans, The Giant Mecha of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> universe, are Semi-sentient, with each having its own mind. On one occasion, the mind of a Titan commander is also resident inside the machine, after he dies while still linked up to it.
</li><li> It should also be noted that Machine Spirits seem to be real, particularly in more advanced machines; Land Raider tanks in particular have a reputation for continuing fighting long after their crew has been killed. Either the vehicles genuinely are possessed, quite possible in the demon and god filled setting, or the Techpriests are building AIs into their machines without realizing it, since many machines are made by creating exact copies of ancient designs that nobody really understands anymore.
<ul><li> Some 40k media state that instead of AIs the Adeptus uses the brains of large, predatory animals as organic computers, which explains why a tank can go "feral".
</li></ul></li><li> The closest things to being "cute" in a non-ugly way in that world are the drones the Tau use. They're programmed to be loyal like puppies, and as a result the Tau consider them companions rather than, well, expendable drones (a sentiment decidedly <em>not</em> shared by the players).

How big the Delusion is (how many points it's worth) depends not on the nature of the Delusion, but on how much it affects your character's behavior. In practical terms, this Delusion could range from saying hello to purple objects and patting them (Quirk or Minor Delusion) all the way up to attacking purple things on sight (Major Delusion) and refusing to talk until all of them are taken from the room.

Many 'Mechs are passed down as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon">Ancestral Weapons</a>, so some families train the next generation of pilots with it and pass on its legacy that way. As a result, many Inner Sphere pilots specialize in piloting one or two chassis, and sometimes one 'Mech in specific, leading to this trope when a pilot spends their entire life with a certain 'Mech to the point that they give it a name and sometimes a 'personality' based on its quirks. This is also because Inner Sphere pilots are much more likely to <em>own</em> their own gear than comparable Clan pilots, for whom being reassigned from one 'Mech to another depending on the needs of the unit is a fairly commonplace occurrence. Much of this is inspired by the real-life military examples below, and aircraft pilots/crews in particular.

GLaDOS's comments indirectly invite the player to see it as a living thing and empathize with it, up to the point where she requires the player to "euthanize" it. She later tries to guilt-trip you for killing the Companion Cube. Doug Rattmann's graffiti seen scribbled in behind-the-scenes sections of the testing facility show that he mourns the loss of his Companion Cube. The <em>Lab Rat</em> comic reveals the cube actually <em>talked</em> to Rattmann due to his schizophrenia, and it gave surprisingly helpful advice. The whole thing is a humorous way to teach players that they'll need to carry the cube through several puzzles in order to complete them. One of the developers has stated that he based the use of the trope on a declassified CIA document which stated that people in isolation would bond with inanimate objects.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> carries on the tradition by including several other Companion Cubes with updated designs, first in the early test chambers, where GLaDOS taunts you by destroying one, then reveals that she has "entire warehouses full of them," and <em>then</em> destroys another when you try to smuggle it out of the test chamber, which you would never think to do if she wasn't giving you hints about it. At the very end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she gives you back the original Cube, charred from its trip to the incinerator but otherwise apparently intact</span>.

<ul><li> Earlier Crimbo seasons offered the Pet Rock and the (non)functionally identical Toothsome Rock.
</li><li> The Sombrero and Bloodfaced Volleyball as well, though they do do things...somehow. (though at least Sombrero is partially justified by being combined with a chicken's ghost.)

<ul><li> The Sandvich, which comes from the same update as Natascha, appears to be getting the same attention as well, with lines such as; "What's that, Sandvich? KILL THEM ALL!? GOOD IDEA!"

</li><li> It is also revealed that the Heads in meet the Soldier are the Soldier's companion cubes.
</li><li> According to supplementary comics, the Soldier also thinks he's part of a regiment where the other members are just bits of painted wood, but he's assigned them all distinctive personalities and talks to them as if they're real.
</li><li> One Valve-made comic has a photo of the Heavy sleeping in his forest cabin, with Sasha lying next to him on a smaller bed. The Scout lampshades this odd situation.

</li><li> The series also has "Charley", a potted plant in the main character's office. It's one of the few characters from the original series to show up in the fourth and fifth games.

More straightforwardly, in an early scene of the fourth game, Nero and Kyrie talk about Nero's "Red Queen" sword as if discussing a female.
<ul><li> Two of the Devil Arms, Agni and Rudra, can even talk, although Dante would only take them with him if they kept silent. They start laughing during one of Dante's flashier combos with them, forcing Dante to yell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigShutUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigShutUp">"SILENCE!"</a> as a reminder of their agreement.

Initially you just start playing with it, but then you can talk to it, much to Morte's irritation. It gets better from there, to the point where Morte's final irritation is actually worth a voiced line. Also makes your character alignment more Chaotic.
</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband">Angband</a></em> players treat slime molds as pets rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog">as food items</a>.

<ul><li> In the Lonesome Road DLC, ED-E becomes much more emotive, revealing a deeper personality and backstory. He was the prized creation of Dr. Whitley, who fawned over ED-E, but was unfortunate enough to have been created him in the Enclave. ED-E was forcibly upgraded by another Enclave researcher, a process as painful to ED-E as anesthetic-free vivisection to a human. The last straw was when Colonel Autumn, commander of the Enclave, ordered Whitley to destroy the Duraframe Eyebots for use in the Hellfire Armor project. ED-E was forced to flee from the one man he loved to escape death, who was likely killed in the Enclave-Brotherhood of Steel war. Essentially, ED-E's story is both remarkable and tragic.

The friendship is only temporary, since Timon and Pumbaa reunite again and the meteor strikes a new relationship with a cheetah.

</li><li> In an incredibly literal case of this trope, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Eliacube</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> is this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Nox</a>, who is heartbroken and obsessive enough to hear it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices">talk back</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, this relationship turns ugly.</span>

He takes the burrito to the movie theater, and the owners even end up charging the price of another ticket, which Panda and Ice aren't thrilled about either. Grizz gets defensive whenever Panda or Ice talks negatively about the burrito and even says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">its/"his" name is Burrito, not ''that'' burrito.</a> Panda reads articles about other people obsessed with food items including an Idaho woman obsessed with a bag of potato chips, someone in Japan marrying a bowl of ramen, and someone else adopting a jar of pickles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A flashback reveals that when Grizz was rescued by a fireman as a cub, the burrito resembled the fireman's arm wrapped in a foil-like protective sleeve.</span>
<ul><li> Panda has a body pillow of an anime girl called Miki-chan who he treats as if it were an actual person, and he's also very attached to his phone, who he calls "Cellie." In one episode, Grizz also acts as if Miki-chan were real, and another episode shows that before Panda met the other bears, he was raised alone in a sanctuary where the workers gave him a stuffed toy panda when he was lonely, which he spoke to and had conversations with, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and it even helped him escape to the outside world</span>.

<ul><li> The Pet Rock, a 1970s phenomenon, was based around this idea.
</li><li> The digital pet craze of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> could be seen as yet another variant of this.
</li><li> Many people have toys, porcelain dolls and security blankets for this very reason.
</li><li> The practice of personifying ships and other forms of transportation goes back so far it's definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a> and might be even as old as mankind. Many ancient cultures would ritually paint or carve eyes on the prow of ships as a way of granting them sentience, a practice still followed today in some places. Depending on the culture, ships (and other vehicles) may be personified as male or female, regardless of whether the vehicle's name implies one or the other. Of course, for the English-speaking crowd, a personified vehicle is almost always female, even if she's the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_John_S._McCain_(DDG-56)">USS John S. McCain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In his book <em>Water Transport</em>, historian James Hornell mentions an old Hindu tradition which involves imbuing a protective god or goddess into a ship, taking the personification a step further. This coincides with an "opening of the eye" ceremony, in which pupils are carved into the outline of an eye to "awaken" the ship.
</li><li> During WWI and WWII almost all aircrews named their birds, as they were assigned to fly only one. In those days production standards couldn't be as high as they were today, so every airplane had its own ticks and tricks. This was more noticeable in bombers. Nearly every B-29 bomber ever produced had its own unique flaw that would have made it inoperable. One of the design engineers, Victor Agather, had to fix 600 of these fatal flaws in a three-day time period. Every bomber's crew were the only people who could keep it flying, so they would only be paired with that aircraft, kicking off the relationship between crew and machine. Most of them even made their own extensive modifications to keep their birds flying, like waxing the props. Many bomber crews would not only refer to their airplanes as female, but went so far as to refer to the airplane's model as if it were the airplane's ethnicity. For that matter, the very fact that aircrews <em>call</em> their planes "birds" has overtones of this.
</li><li> Also the subject of a psychiatry study with monkeys. Young monkeys were studied with various socialization forms: one was only socialized with its mother, one was socialized with many other monkeys, and the last was only socialized with a fur-covered board. The young monkey became extremely attached to the board.
</li><li> In 2000, a ficus tree ran against incumbent Rodney P. Frelinghuysen for the 11th district New Jersey house seat... and won the election by a 4:1 ratio before being disqualified. The Ficus campaign was masterminded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore">Michael Moore</a> for his TV show <em>The Awful Truth</em>.

Presumably so that they remember to take care of the firearm and have it at their side whenever possible.

</li><li> In software development, when trying to fix a stubborn bug, it is sometimes considered helpful to discuss the bug with another developer. The practice is considered useful even when the other person is completely unfamiliar with the code, perhaps not even a developer at all. The reasoning is that the act of having to explain it to another person forces you to step back from the problem a bit and challenge some of your assumptions. Lone developers will sometimes resort to discussing the problem with an inanimate object, a practice which has come to be called "talking to the Furby." And then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>...
</li><li> One university's engineering department has a teddy bear sitting in the dean's office. If a student comes in with an engineering problem that they can't handle, they are first urged to "talk to the bear". Often, after they go over the problem with the bear, they do actually come up with a solution.
</li><li> A number of people <a class="urllink" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006030409257">name their cars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and talk to them.

</li><li> Serge Kahili King in his book <em>Urban Shaman</em> explains that he named his personal computer and speaks to it. "All things have their own spirit. They cooperate better if you can relate to them well."
</li><li> It's not entirely uncommon for musicians to name their instruments, especially adolescents in high school band.
<ul><li> B.B. King's guitar Lucille may be the most famous example.
</li><li> Willie Nelson's guitar Trigger is at least a close second.
</li><li> Andres Segovia at times ended up with rumors of a woman in his life after booking transit tickets for his guitar — by name.
</li><li> Stevie Ray Vaughan played a Strat which he named "Lenny" after his wife Lenora.

Doktor runs the online advice column on the Sisters' website. He's also a drum machine.
</li><li> Often professional musicians who play a large instrument (cello, double bass, etc.) travelling by plane will book a separate seat for the instrument (mainly to avoid it getting damaged in the hold). Owing to airplane regulations, they are consequently obliged to give the instrument a name so that all seats have a corresponding name on the flight manifest. Some instruments even qualified for frequent flyer status.
</li></ul></li><li> Steam Locomotives are always referred to as she, even if they have a male name. This often causes confusion to the punters.
</li><li> Joe Duddington apparently gently encouraged Mallard to help her break the World Steam Speed record.
</li><li> Champion Detroit Tigers pitcher Mark Fidrych talked to the ball before throwing it, among other eccentricities. Proof that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> exists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</li><li> Hockey goaltender Patrick Roy was famous during his active career for naming his goalposts and talking to them, thanking them when a shot bounced off one of them instead of going in. Considering his highly successful career, he was probably on to something.
</li><li> Build-A-Bear Workshop is a company that basically caters to this trope, where children (or even grown-ups) go to the workshop and pick the skins of their stuffed animal, fluff it up themselves, put a heart in it, and proceed to give it a birth certificate and even enter it in a system quite like Amber Alert.
</li><li> This was done to a lesser extent with adopting Cabbage Patch Kids. It's played out completely at the official Cabbage Patch Museum. Hundreds of dolls are arranged in theme rooms. The main room is the actual cabbage patch, where several times a day visitors can witness the labor and birth of a real doll out of one of the cabbages. The audience is then asked to help name the new "baby" and she is immediately put up for adoption in the gift shop.

One such delusion is called "Delusional Companions Syndrome", a condition that mostly affects Alzheimer's patients who believe inanimate objects are actually sentient.
</li><li> With the dramatic increase in the use of robotic drones in the US military, there were a variety of concerns including the idea that soldiers might be more removed from battle or otherwise not want to use such things due to their inherent complexity in a chaotic environment (i.e. they'd be more trouble than they're worth). Well, as it turns out, this isn't exactly true...
<ul><li> One EOD squad ended up taking their bomb defusing robot out drinking with them.
</li><li> A soldier was in tears when he brought in his squad's robot drone (nicknamed "Scooby Doo") for repairs. When told he'd just get a new drone, he replied that he didn't want a new one, he wanted Scooby Doo.
</li><li> A soldier ran 84 yards through enemy fire to rescue a downed drone.

</li></ul></li><li> The custom of giving tropical cyclones human names started in 1944, when forecasters in the U.S. military started nicknaming storms after their wives and girlfriends. Giving human names to storms eliminates confusion, but it also adds a certain identity to the storms.
</li><li> In 2007, a female swan fell in love with a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/love-at-first-flight-for-swan-and-boat/">swan-shaped boat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The several TV examples of characters using pillows as either imaginary characters or replacements for real people is based on the real life phenomenon.
</li><li> During the meeting between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander at Erfurt in 1808, Alexander's brother Constantine apparently told one of Napoleon's aides: "I say, Monsieur Oudinot, if your august master were to give me one of his swords, I should take it to bed with me!" (the original French sounded even more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a>, with Constantine saying "<em>je coucherais avec elle</em>", which is more often used to refer to the other kind of "going to bed".)
</li><li> A woman asks her husband to take some pictures of himself with his new selfie stick as he goes about his daily routine. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/5l998f/just_doing_what_my_wife_asked/">Cue a series of pics where the guy actually includes the stick in the pics with him, treating it like a friend or a loyal pet.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Similar to soldiers and their drones, the Opportunity Martian Rover (affectionately called "Oppy") held a similar place in the hearts of NASA, and nerd culture. "She" managed to last 15 years, and was even taught to sing "Happy Birthday" to herself. Her permanent deactivation on February 13th 2019 due to her heating unit being broken by a dust storm was cause for <em>mourning</em> in certain circles.
<ul><li> One and a half year before, after the robotic Cassini spacecraft had been disposed of by plunging her into Saturn's atmosphere, there were tears in JPL's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>, as some team members had been involved in the mission for decades.

However, they are more famous among otaku, who often buy body pillows of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust">fictional characters that they are attracted to</a>, which overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip">Cargo Ship</a>.
