</div><div class="indent"><strong>Eleanor:</strong> Yeah, we were all confused about that too.

None of them seems to work, or if they do, they're usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek">actors, columnists or whatever leaves them with a lot of leisure time</a> to have drama in their clean, well-furnished apartments. How can they afford it? They have Friends Rent Control, named after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, where the cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> their situation by saying they had rent control.
</p><p>Rent control means that a landlord can only raise a tenant's rent by a certain percentage each year, making it possible for long-term residents to continue paying low rents while the neighborhood around them gentrifies. Illegal subletting may be involved if the renter has only lived there a short time.
</p><p>The most obvious cause of the trope is that larger sets are easier to film in. Even if the home is supposed to look relatively run-down or poor, it's a nightmare to block out scenes where characters are practically on top of each other and get in each other's way when they move around. Larger sets also let you break up the action into multiple locations, allowing for concurrent scenes and conversations within the same area.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>However, not all large homes are necessarily examples of the trope. There are numerous mitigating factors that may justify why the characters' can afford such a large home:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Geographic location. To use the United States as an example, Americans on average have the largest homes in the world at every income level. If the characters are explicitly poor, their home may look too big to viewers elsewhere even if it's actually realistic. And there's plenty of variance within the country as well; the average price of a two-bedroom apartment in New York City would get you a <em>penthouse</em> in Cleveland<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ri34');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ri34" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ri34');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">Inland cities</a> in the US tend to have a much lower cost of living than the coasts</span>, and if you don't live in or near a major city, prices can drop even further, meaning it can very well be possible for someone to afford a spacious home on a modest income.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Financial stability of the characters. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalaryMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalaryMan">steady day-job</a> tends to be far more lucrative than a wish-fulfillment career of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">a painter, writer, performer</a>, etc. Roommates can also change everything. A three-bedroom apartment with 3+ roommates can result in a much nicer place than a one-bedroom.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedHouse">quality</a> of the place. Busted appliances, structural damage, and being on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks">Wrong Side of the Tracks</a> also drive the price down. Sometimes there might be a throwaway line about the place having a bad history (native burial ground, site of a murder, etc).
</li><li> The layout and good cinematography make some homes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">look larger than they are</a>. Many people who visit such sets comment on how they're a lot smaller than they look on screen.
</li><li> Time period. The community may have significantly gentrified since the work was filmed. In areas like Southern California and New York, property values have risen far faster than the average salary, so what was once a realistically middle-class home in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">the 1980s</a> might be far too expensive for the same characters today.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/AbsolutelyRoseStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/AbsolutelyRoseStreet">Absolutely Rose Street</a></em>, the main characters are supposed to be a couple of 20-somethings barely keeping afloat yet they live in a spacious southern California house (or at minimum, a very large basement).
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first anime, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a>'s</em> household, in the particularly expensive Tokyo district of Juubangai, is kept afloat by a <em>news photographer</em> (although later it seems he's been promoted to editor, and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">live-action television series</a> he's instead highly respected and well-known photojournalist).
</li><li> Another baffling example is the case of Makoto Kino/Jupiter, who is orphaned and does not have a job but owns and maintains her own apartment. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> tends to say that her parents left her a very large inheritance. The same is also true of Mamoru Chiba/Tuxedo Mask, however in the anime he is seen working at various jobs and it is explicitly stated that his parents left him a <em>very</em> large trust fund.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ">Detective School Q</a></em>, it's not clear if Kyu's mom actually <em>has</em> a job, but she can afford a house in Tokyo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, one has to wonder how Delia Ketchum affords her house, considering that she doesn't seem to work (except in Takeshi Shudō's novelization, where it's explained that she runs Pallet Town's only restaurant, Pallet House, which she inherited from her mother) and she has no husband. Mr. Mime, doing all the household chores. Granted, perhaps the <em>Pokemon</em> regions have different economic policies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> played with this in case of Keiichi, who lives with all three goddesses in a ridiculously large mansion that no college student could realistically afford. In reality, however, it's a rundown and abandoned Buddhist temple that was refurbished by Belldandy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">magic</a>.
</li><li> The three sisters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe">Minami-ke</a></em> are all students, with the oldest being in High School, and they live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">by themselves</a> in a fairly big four-room apartment, despite having no apparent income. It's implied once that their father isn't around, either living elsewhere or dead, and the mother isn't referred to at all.
</li><li> Played with in various continuities of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> A frequent cause of disbelief is the size of Tenchi's house, that's apparently too large for the incomes of a single architect (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Tenchi's father</a> Nobuyuki) and a retired Shinto priest (his grandfather Katsuhito) to maintain, let alone acquire a land for, especially with the frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode">Broke Episodes</a> in TV Series, bringing the accusations of Masakis being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandPoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandPoor">Land Poor</a>. On the other hand, at least in the OVA continuity it's justified by the fact that it sits in the countryside on the grounds of a family shrine, of which Katsuhito is the priest, and that their original house in the city was much smaller. Furthermore, at least in the OVA continuity the Jurai Empire has serious covert influence on Earth, and Katsuhito has basically infinite funds, if he ever chose to use them.
</li><li> Possibly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLovelyGhostKana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLovelyGhostKana">My Lovely Ghost Kana</a></em>, because the apartment building where Daikichi lives is described as "nearly abandoned" and he may actually be squatting. Neither is it entirely clear what he actually does for a living.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> seems to enjoy toying with this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It helps that the characters who live alone don't require things like food or heat to survive.</span> Mami, Homura, and Kyoko are 15-year old girls who live alone in a fairly large Japanese city with no income, yet they can each afford their own homes. Homura owns a large apartment in a European-styled building with modern furniture and holographic displays, though odds are she steals things to afford it (or stole the apartment itself), given <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that's how she gets her weapons</span>. Kyoko is shown in nice rooms, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's homeless, and the nice rooms are hotel rooms she gets into</span>. Mami's apartment is an aversion at first; it is rather large, yet barren and spartan, with cheap furnishings that reasonably fit with her means. However, this realism was a byproduct of the animation budget running out. The Blu-Ray version fills her house with all sorts of things that she could never afford, planting it <a class="urllink" href="http://images.puella-magi.net/7/76/Mami_nice_apt.jpg?20110426211524">firmly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> into this trope.
<ul><li> The main character's no exception. Madoka's dad is a househusband, she has a baby brother and her mom is a realistically alcoholic business woman. Even if she makes a ton, it can't be enough to afford the Kanames' large, custom-built, ultramodern house in the Mitakihara suburbs. Which amusingly is the case, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that Madoka's family got the house build by a friend who works in the construction industry.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> is notable for avoiding this trope most of the time, but Jenrya/Henry's house is a little harder to justify; he has a bunch of siblings and his parents jobs (never explicitly explained, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states they are a computer programmer and a graphic designer, respectively) dont seem like they would be able to afford the enormous apartment he lives in.
</li><li> The Tendo Dojo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> is a traditional Japanese compound with four bedrooms, two guestrooms, a large tearoom, and a large freestanding dojo, all surrounded by a an expansive walled garden including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatGoesDoink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatGoesDoink">The Thing That Goes "Doink"</a>. It's all a bit much for a self-employed martial artist supporting three daughters and three freeloaders. While it's reasonable to assume that a traditional dojo would have rooms to house students, Mr. Tendo doesn't appear to <em>have</em> any students, other than Akane (daughter) and Ranma (freeloader).
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>, where none of the girls appear to be employed and, aside from Naru and Shinobu, none of whom have any source of family income. And somehow they all make rent, something that is referenced once or twice throughout the series.
</li><li> The Hyoudou residence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School D×D</a></em> starts out reasonable, being a two-story family home with both parents implied to work. It then starts to push it when Asia and then Rias move in, revealing it has at least two spare bedrooms.

And that's just going off what she's inherited, since she also works as what's implied to be a high priced assassin and takes a number of lucrative jobs over the course of the series, so she doesn't ever appear to be worried about money.

And when she does finally start working, she's still in a job that doesn't pay much. Even for Iowa, one of the cheapest housing markets in the country, that's quite a stretch. (When she rents the house, the manager can be heard saying it's $700 a month, and apparently doesn't ask for any information about her employment.) As well as that she's able to afford plenty of luxuries like brand name products. The book is only slightly better — Sara/Laura paid a month's rent for one floor of a house in advance but then had to live on beans and apples for two weeks until her job (which came out of nowhere and paid very well, not to mention paid <em>in advance</em>) started. The rent was supposed to be "cut" because Laura was willing to paint, but it couldn't have been cut <em>that</em> much; painting is a one-time expense. So the real question is why she fled her husband after months of planning without even enough money to pay for a month's expenses, knowing she'd have to be exceptionally lucky to land a job that doesn't require an identity.

When her business begins to suffer, however, her lifestyle doesn't seem to be affected at all (aside from one scene where she doesn't have enough cash to cover her purchases at a food market).

(It's explicitly stated in one of the short stories that Michael Carpenter refuses to cut corners and being a Knight hasn't allowed him the time to grow his business enough to attract many really big, lucrative jobs.) They live in a large house in Chicago that is always in perfect repair, since Michael apparently has enough spare time between fighting evil and building middle-class houses to keep his own home and yard in fantastic shape, including upgraded doors, a panic room, new extensions as needed for a growing family, and a treehouse that's probably at least studio-apartment size (though the fact that he builds houses for a living means that if he does have the time, he can do all that purely for the cost of materials, as he clearly has the skills to do such things on his own time for free). It's possible that divine grace (or, more likely, the Church) drops baskets full of money on a Knight of the Cross, though that doesn't explain why teenage runaway Molly Carpenter could afford a place to stay, along with several hundreds of dollars worth of tattoos and piercings, without access to her parent's money.

<ul><li> The rent for Monica's apartment <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/21/friends-debut-anniversary-how-much-is-monicas-apartment-worth-now.html">was estimated, if it were real,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to be $4,000-$4,600 per month<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2a2k8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2a2k8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2a2k8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is adjusted for inflation from 2018 dollars — the article ballparked it at $7,000-$8,000/month in Sept. 2018 dollars and doesn't take into account any gentrification effects New York has gone through since the mid-1990s</span>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwaved</a> by Monica claiming that her grandmother originally rented the apartment at $200/month and she is illegally subletting it, which is actually in the realm of possibility due to rent control in Manhattan. The superintendent is actually aware that Monica is breaking the law, and one episode centered on Joey trying to persuade him not to blow the whistle after his patience runs out. That being said, there was a chunk of time where Monica was unemployed, meaning the entire apartment's rent fell to the wages of a waitress. A particularly terrible, and therefore probably poorly-tipped, waitress. Though in fairness, Monica borrows money from Ross and makes several references to her savings being quickly depleted, so clearly she was still paying some rent. Given her status as the responsible one, it's likely she would save up in the event of crisis.
</li><li> Chandler and Joey's apartment directly across the hall is an aversion, as Chandler has what is implied to be a high-paying white collar job which would allow him to support both himself and the frequently unemployed Joey, and yet their apartment is roughly a quarter the size of Monica's and is sparsely furnished. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Chandler in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, by telling his newborn children of the apartment: "because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal."
</li><li> Played straight with Phoebe, whose apartment was larger and nicer than Joey and Chandler's. Justified in early seasons as she was sharing it with her grandmother but is later living alone on a masseuse's salary. There is a plot point later in the series where Phoebe is now working for a corporate chain that pays better, despite it being against her morals.
</li><li> There's also the original apartment Ross resided in that was about midway between Joey and Chandler's and Monica and Rachel's apartments size-wise that he lived in alone. He may have lived there with Carol originally, but he stays there until Emily forces him to move and he moves in with Joey and Chandler, then to Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, which is much smaller than even Joey and Chandler's place, but much nicer looking.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Becker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Becker">Becker</a></em>: Linda the brain dead bimbo nurse of Dr. Becker lives in a spacious and lavishly furnished apartment overlooking Central Park that Becker is completely envious of. Though this is because her parents, who are extremely rich, pay for it. Becker himself has told her that he has the desire to murder her and live there, played for laughs.
<div class="indent"><strong>Linda</strong>: You know Becker, I have a real urge to hug you. <br/><strong>Becker</strong>: Yeah, I have a real urge to kill you and live here.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>: Mac's Georgetown apartment probably costs as much for one month's rent as a JAG lawyer would earn in three months. It can't even be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> in any meaningful way, since it's well-established that Mac came from a poor family. (To their credit, they never really even tried.) The same arguably applies to Harm's apartment, but it has the mitigating circumstance of being located "north of Union Station" (a really bad neighborhood in real life, so it's somewhat plausible that even an apartment that big and nice would be relatively cheap) and being almost derelict until Harm personally renovated the place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivingSingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivingSingle">Living Single</a></em> also takes full advantage of this trope. While it makes sense for stockbroker Kyle and superintendent Overton to afford their nice place and for lawyer Maxine to have her own rarely-seen apartment, the place (and main hangout) where Regine, Khadijah and Synclaire live and how it could be afforded defies logic. The women live in a beautifully furnished unit where each of them not only has their own room , but also <em>has a second-story</em>, in spite of them being employed as a department store salesgirl, the owner of a fledgling magazine (which is so cash-pressed, that they usually don't even have money for office supplies) and an aspiring actress/receptionist for said magazine, respectively. But as the series goes on, Regine gets better jobs over time and Khadijah's magazine gains hype which presumably leads to higher pay, which makes their living situation easier to swallow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout">Al Bundy</a> made minimum wage and was the only working member of the family, yet they lived in a two-story house with a large basement in a neighborhood that's nice enough to have a pair of upper-middle class bankers as their next-door neighbors. It's also clean and tastefully decorated, making it a stretch for us to believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingInAFurnitureStore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingInAFurnitureStore">that the place is a dump</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7">S Club 7</a></em>:
<ul><li> The second season of their TV series <em>LA 7</em> fits closest to the trope. S Club 7 manage to find a pretty nice building with enough room for seven people. Their landlady Joni features as a supporting character and she first gives them the apartment out of sympathy. The gang are constantly talking about how they're broke and owe each other money, hand-waving it somewhat. One episode also has the power getting rather easily shut down just from all seven using it at once — and Joni claims that the wiring was "kind of a death trap".
</li><li> <em>Miami 7</em> inverts it, with the group living in bunk beds in what looks more like a cramped military barracks than a Miami hotel. Knowing how tight the owner Howard is, it's incredibly possible that he gave them the worst rooms in an already terrible hotel.
</li><li> <em>Hollywood 7</em> and <em>Viva S Club</em> were a bit more justified in that they were now established as a band in America and thus earning enough to afford their homes in Hollywood and Barcelona respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> Carrie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a></em> is an interesting example, as this depends on whether the episode in question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">depicts her as a nationwide sensation like the real Candace Bushnell or as another workaday columnist.</a> If the latter is true, then it's unknown how she can afford her nice apartment and her extensive collection of shoes. One episode revealed that her rent is only $750 a month, though at the time she only had $1,600 in her bank account. One episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> the trope. Carrie remarks to her screenwriter boyfriend-of-the-season that his TV script about a bunch of young actors living in a Manhattan penthouse is hardly realistic. Another episode reveals her apartment was rent controlled. When Aidan buys her building and gives her the option of either buying the apartment or leaving, she starts to look at more believably-priced buildings (including one which apparently reeks because it's right above an Indian restaurant.) Apparently, she got the apartment and the rental value just exploded around her. The exterior of her apartment, actually a five bedroom townhouse, sold for $13.2 million in 2013.
</li><li> Richie and Eddie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom">Bottom</a></em> definitely are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingInAFurnitureStore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingInAFurnitureStore">Living in a Furniture Store</a>: their residence is a gradually decaying first-floor walkup flat over a corner shop. And yet, although we occasionally meet the landlord, making the rent never seems to be an issue, despite the fact that our protagonists haven't held a steady job since 1979. They attempt to handwave this away in an early episode by mentioning an aunt of Richie's who is the actual owner of the flat; said aunt, however, is never spoken of again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> has perhaps the strangest variation on this. The show's White House sets include vast, opulently furnished rooms such as the Lobby, the Roosevelt Room, and the Mural Room. The real-life West Wing either doesn't have these at all, or has much smaller, shabbier versions, as you'd expect given that, for all intents and purposes, this is essentially a glorified government office building. Part of what causes this dissonance is the desire to create a sense of constant activity within the White House, resulting in the TV version being more active than the real thing (as well as having many more pretty glass doors and windows to exhibit this activity).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>: While rents are probably fairly affordable in the Colorado suburb where everyone lives, the fact that most of the cast lacks any income brings this trope into effect.
<ul><li> The Troy/Abed/Annie apartment. Annie originally lives by herself in a terrible apartment but moves in with Troy and Abed to a nicer area. They split the rent on the two-bedroom apartment, which is probably pretty affordable, but it's never stated where any of them are getting the money, as none of them have jobs. Presumably they're getting money from their parents, though this is never confirmed.
</li><li> Jeff lives by himself in a nice apartment. In the first season, he has to deal with not having enough money to live there or afford new fixtures for the place, but he decides to stay living there. In spite of still not having a job, his rent problems don't get brought up again.
</li><li> Subverted with Britta in season 5, when she learns that her parents have been secretly paying her rent behind her back.
</li></ul></li><li> Seemingly played straight, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>. Dennis and Mac live in a nice two-bedroom apartment with a leather couch, despite making less than they would on unemployment. Dee lives alone in a very nice apartment despite making even less than the bar owners. Dennis and Dee come from a wealthy family, however, and a Season 5 episode explicitly mentions that Frank pays Dee's rent (and presumably at least helping with Dennis'). Meanwhile, Charlie lives in abject squalor, averting the trope entirely.
</li><li> Particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>.
<ul><li> Mohinder is able to afford a <em>huge</em> apartment in Brooklyn working as a taxi driver, as was his dad. Apparently — according to Season 2, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matt and Molly move in with him</span> — it was a three-bedroom, only one of which was occupied throughout Season 1. We do, however, see Mohinder's family's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a> in India, implying that his family was wealthy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Which makes you wonder why they were working as cabbies in the first place...</a>
</li><li> They really draw attention to it in Peter's case: he gets a job as a nurse, throws a huge party in his new apartment, and everyone acts like it's tiny. Sure, his family's rich and they live in a mansion, but it's still a huge apartment by New York standards.
</li><li> D.L. and Niki's house also qualifies. Their entire plot is kicked off by the fact that they can't afford the rent. But they live in a two-story house in the suburbs which is a little too big for three people, has a pool in the backyard and reflective surfaces on pretty much everything, and a PlayStation 3 inside. If only they'd moved into an apartment or sold something, they wouldn't have had to borrow money from the mob.
</li><li> The Bennetts "go underground" by living in a massive house in a very wealthy neighborhood in Southern California. Noah's cover job is an entry-level position at a copy shop. Presumably he has a great deal of money from working with Primatech and Claire's biological family is absurdly wealthy but using it to live beyond his obvious means kind of defeats the purpose of going into hiding.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>
<ul><li> The apartment where Ted, Marshall, and Lily live has an abnormally large main room but is otherwise not that big. Both the kitchen and the bedrooms are fairly small (Ted's drafting table is in the main room cause it won't fit anywhere else) and it's implied the building itself isn't that great. Ted has always been employed as an architect and Marshall lives off his student loans. Averted when Lily moves out and ends up living in a one room apartment so small that its Murphy bed can't even come down all the way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Ted in Season 4: "I thought having a rent-controlled apartment on the Upper West Side was half the reason she agreed to marry me." Also lampshaded in a flashback when Marshall points out that they can just barely afford their apartment.
</li><li> Justified when Marshall and Lily move into their own place — it's nice, but not overly spacious, and it's stated to be outside their price range despite both of them working full-time (he as a lawyer!). It makes even more sense when we find out that the only reason it was even close to their price range was that it stinks due to its proximity to a sewage plant, and the floors are not level.
<ul><li> It increasingly starts to strain belief when Marshall loses his job and still somehow manages to keep the apartment. He had to take a much higher interest rate when the credit check revealed Lily's enormous credit card debt and his own student loans from Columbia. Not to mention the apartment was discovered to have warped floors that required an expensive repair process.
</li></ul></li><li> Robin's original apartment in the first few seasons is also pretty spacious considering she worked for a low-end news job at the worst station in New York and had five dogs. Season 9 explains that Robin has a lot of money from her wealthy family — and she was previously a famous Canadian pop star.
</li><li> Lampshaded after Marshall and Lily spend some time in a spacious suburban home, and when they return to their apartment, it suddenly appears cramped and tiny in comparison. (This sets up a trope subversion for the rest of the show: We can now assume that all of the apartments are small, and only look big to people used to New York apartments.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Ted's discussion of the apartment being much better is an example of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">Self-Serving Memory</a> telling the entire story to his kids.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>. At first, Elliot lives in a quality apartment despite her low salary. It is later revealed that her rich father pays for all her expenses, and when she refuses to let him make decisions on her life, he cuts her off, forcing her to bunk with her friends or live in a U-Haul truck for an extended period. We do see the effects of this trope, however, when Carla thinks of JD and Turk's normal-sized apartment as "tiny."
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a></em>. The twins and their mother occupy a dwelling that looks more like an incredibly-cramped one bedroom apartment than a suite in a five-star hotel. In the first episode, though, Carey says that he and Mr. Moseby worked out a deal where she gets free room and board.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reaper">Reaper</a></em>, the guys move into a <em>massive</em> three bedroom apartment which cost them only $1,200 a month in rent. Despite Sock trying to handwave it away by saying that he "got a great deal" and it "used to be a meth lab," it's obviously way over the minimum-wage group's income bracket. Especially considering the established gay couple living next door, who have obviously been there for ages, and the wonderful state of repair it is in. This is later justified when it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Devil, Satan, Father of Lies, He Who Is Legion, the Beast Whose Number Is 666, happened to sign their lease as part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> to put down a demonic rebellion</span>.
</li><li> Explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlightOfTheConchords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlightOfTheConchords">Flight of the Conchords</a></em>: The boys' New York City apartment is quite humble, with a small living area, tiny bathroom, and a single bedroom that they share. Even still, it's not clear how they afford it when they make almost no money performing gigs in libraries and such. Brett eventually gets a "real" job holding signs. In the last episode, it's revealed that they've been paying their rent in New Zealand dollars instead of American, so they've been living practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates">rent-free</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: The living room and dining room are somewhat realistic, but how many condos do you know that have a second <em>and</em> third floor and an elevator? It's also decked out with the latest technology. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> confirmed that the elevator opened up to more floors than just the three the Shays used, which might explain why they can afford the apartment — Anyone can enter their apartment at anytime, without their permission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>,
<ul><li> During the first season, Cordelia finds herself a sweet, roomy apartment that she can afford on a receptionist's salary. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's haunted. One of the ghosts tries to kill her, but the other is nice and is thus not exorcised. Phantom Dennis is referenced occasionally in future seasons.</span>
</li><li> It was also never explained how Angel could afford to live and keep an office in the building that he used for Season 1. The hotel used for Season 2 onward however received two handwaves on the subject: first a wealthy client who owed Angel Investigations a favor handled all of the paperwork on the matter, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Lilah</a> (in order to piss off a co-worker) fabricated even more paperwork. Some episodes show that Angel has a sizable collection of antiques from his three hundred years of being a vampire — so presumably he sells them to avoid money problems.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Humphreys keep griping about how they are poor (at least in comparison to the rest of the cast) and how times are rough, which makes sense given that Rufus is the sole breadmaker and he owns a low key art gallery. Their loft, however, suggests that they are considerably more wealthy than Rufus' job would make them, and that they are far from as poor as they keep saying that they are.
</li><li> Blair's dorm room at NYU is approximately the size of at least two actual dorm rooms, so unless she also bought the room next to hers and knocked down the adjoining wall, there's no explanation for how absurdly spacious her room is.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>, Jerry and Elaine have steady jobs, and Jerry's apartment is based heavily on his actual former apartment in the Upper West Side. George's living arrangements depend on his employment status, sometimes resulting in him having to live with his parents. As far as Kramer is concerned, no one has any idea how he can afford his apartment with no obvious source of income, but this was kind of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> throughout the series. It was shown in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou">Mad About You</a></em> that Kramer sublets from Paul and that Paul doesn't want to let go of the apartment; as such he may be subletting at under market value as Kramer is a "good" tenant. In an early episode, it's mentioned that the rent of the apartment above Jerry's is only $400 (possibly <em>actually</em> rent controlled, considering the former resident was an elderly lady).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> it was initially played straight - with the three sisters owning a spacious house in San Francisco, which has some of the most expensive real estate in the US. The house has been in the family for generations, but even the property tax would be a too much for a bank teller-turned-head chef and museum curator-turned-auctioneer to afford. Around the fifth season it's a bit more realistic; Piper now runs a club that is always packed with people (and is able to afford respectable musical guests) and Phoebe is doing well enough as an advice columnist to appear on talk shows and get billboards. The house <em>is</em> said to have been built on a spiritual Nexus generations ago, being passed down over the years — so we have to assume that their ancestors exploited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a> quite a bit — if the show weren't really big on the "not using magic for personal gain" thing; the need to protect the nexus the house is sitting on from falling into the hands of evil might have allowed them to get around that.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRookie2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRookie2018">The Rookie</a></em>, protagonist John Nolan is shown living in a luxury home that would be nowhere near affordable for a rookie cop. It's soon revealed that it belongs to a friend of John's who's allowing him to live there rent free; by the second season, he has moved into a dilapidated house and is working to fix it up on his own time using his past construction experience.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh">Drake &amp; Josh</a></em>, the family lives in a beautiful dwelling. But the father is only a weatherman on the local news. And he does a lousy job of predicting the weather. As for the mother, we never even see her working. What's more is that the pilot episode implies the house comes from Drake's side of the family — so Audrey must be doing very well for herself to own such a house while supporting two children. Audrey is divorced from her first husband so she may have won the house in a settlement, considering she appears to have full custody of the children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>
<ul><li> Although not an apartment, Buffy and Willow's dorm room is rather large for a dorm housing incoming freshmen.
</li><li> Xander averted this throughout the series. In Season 4 he lived in his parents' basement and being charged rent while he went through a number of scut jobs. Then in Season 5, he moved into an absurdly spacious apartment, but was hesitant because the rent was too high and, while he and Anya possibly could have afforded it if they lived together, he wasn't comfortable with it; later in the episode his contract construction gig becomes a permanent job and he takes the apartment. Throughout the rest of the series we regularly see him on the job at construction sites, and by Season 7 he's implied to have been promoted again, since he's in charge of a major project and frequently in suits to talk to clients.
</li><li> In Seasons 1-3, Joyce has a gallery and yet Buffy is always shown wearing the latest fashions in every episode without working on her own. While one could argue that Buffy's father might send money their way it's still a huge stretch that Joyce's gallery pays for their nice house (and the constant repairs to it), all their luxuries and Buffy's designer wardrobe. In one episode, Xander comments that Joyce had at some point taken to buying cheap furniture (the coffee table was made of balsa wood) and having workable yet inexpensive repair work done around the main window due to the constant damage to the house.
</li><li> Sunnydale is stated to have insanely low property values. This fact serves two purposes: it explains how a single mom, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and later, a group of twentysomethings who are either college students or working in fast food</span> can afford such a nice home, and it explains why people even live in a town that is ravaged by demons on a near-weekly basis.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes">The Young Ones</a></em>: Four unemployed college students are renting a house in London. Averted partly by the implication that Mike is blackmailing their landlord into discounting their rent, partly by the fact that the house is falling to pieces (their first house is condemned and demolished at the end of the first episode), and almost entirely by the fact that all UK higher education students at the time got a generous means-tested grant to cover their living expenses, Housing Benefit to top up any shortfall, unemployment benefit during vacations, and paid no tuition fees. Part of the joke was the needless squalor in which they lived, given how relatively well-off students could be. In the final episode, they get turfed out when Jerzy has enough of them not paying rent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> is a borderline example. Lorelai and Rory live in a lavishly furnished two-story house in rural Connecticut, far larger than is practical for a single mother and her teenage daughter. She lives there on the salary of a bed-and-breakfast manager, a job she earned working up from being a maid after being a teenage mother at sixteen. It's a plot point that Lorelai saved up for years to afford the house, which isn't in the best condition. For the bulk of Rory's childhood, they lived rent-free in a converted shack behind the inn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bunheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bunheads">Bunheads</a></em> veers wildly back and forth on this trope: one of the arcs of the first season was dedicated to the financial intricacies of the main characters' home ownership situation, which, however, never made much sense and never seemed to actually imperil their ownership of a house that they explicitly could not afford. Played utterly straight when Sasha, a sixteen-year-old girl without a paying job, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whose parents have both moved to different cities, leaving her to live on her own, rents and furnishes a gigantic apartment in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingInAFurnitureStore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingInAFurnitureStore">impeccable taste</a></span>. Although her resourcefulness in dealing with the logistics of all this at 16 is highlighted, there's not so much as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> towards <em>who is paying for all this</em>.

Ricky's apartment gets a pass because it used to belong to Leo's wealthy parents. A few headscratchers in particular are Adrian and her mom having an upscale apartment in Season 1, even though they were supposed to be kinda poor. Daniel and his friends also manage to have lavish apartments, despite being college students.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens">The King of Queens</a></em>. Doug is a package delivery man and Carrie is a legal secretary, yet they can afford a detached, two-story house in Queens while supporting Carrie's elderly father and paying for a car, big-screen television, daily dog walker and other luxuries. Granted, Doug's job is unionized, big-firm legal secretaries do pretty well, Arthur has retirement money to pay his way, and Queens is not Manhattan. Still, it <em>is</em> New York City with the related real estate prices, taxes and insurance rates.
</li><li> Long-running Australian soap <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em> has many examples, mostly teen characters set up in their own living spaces but with no job or income to support them.

<ul><li> The production team takes great pains to make Sean's apartment in Season 3 look like a dump, but a single person on welfare in Ontario receives about $300 a month for rent. There's no way he could realistically pay for an apartment that size in Toronto.
</li><li> The house that Ellie, Marco, Paige, and Alex (replaced with Griffin later on) shared looked a little more spacious than what four college students could realistically afford.
</li><li> Similarly, in later seasons, Fiona's condo. At first her finances are being covered by her wealthy parents but after her mother is investigated for tax fraud, Fiona is forced to take on a roommate and yet the both of them are able to pay for a very large condo in a very trendy neighbourhood in Toronto with their combined salaries from minimum wage mall jobs (and Fiona's is only part-time, as she was still enrolled in school).

Don Ramon and La Chilindrina live in a one-bedroom apartment in a low-rent neighborhood. However, given that Don Ramon is either unemployed or in a very low-wage job, he should still not be able to afford it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Thing is, Señor Barriga forgives his rent and has been doing so for the past fourteen months</a>, and in some episodes, Don Ramon manages to scrape up the dosh to pay for at least one month.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>, averted and played straight. Castle, being a famous bestselling author of over 20 novels as well as being well-known in New York's elite and upper-class circles, can easily afford his spacious penthouse. On the other hand, Beckett's apartment would break the wallet of a police detective, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and this was before it got blown up.

Or how Elena and Jeremy manage to live comfortably despite all of their caretakers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being dead</span>. Though the latter case is understandable being the Gilberts are a wealthy family, they're friends with the mayor and also several vampires who can just compel the payments to go away.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl">New Girl</a></em>. The cast lives in an extremely spacious loft apartment in Los Angeles, and their fortunes rise and fall over the course of the show. Winston and Jess are each jobless at some point in the early seasons, and Nick is always broke. However, Schmidt does make a good living at a white collar job. In later seasons, as many as six people are living in the loft, splitting the rent. Similar apartments rent for <a class="urllink" href="http://la.curbed.com/2015/6/3/9955406/new-girl-apartment">$4,500 a month<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

It makes you wonder if he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">on the take</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>: Some found it unrealistic that Danny could have afforded what was obviously a very nice, very big town house (5-bedrooms, with a spacious attic, huge basement, and attached garage) in a presumably equally very nice section of San Francisco on a TV morning show host's salary, as well as support three young children. There's never any mention of Joey or Jesse paying him rent (not that they could have, given how sporadic their employment was for the first few seasons of the show).
<ul><li> Real estate prices in the early to mid 80s in San Francisco were a much different animal than today when Danny and his wife presumably would have bought the property. Expensive, sure, but not out of reach of a television newscaster, particularly if his wife also worked. Life insurance from her death would also likely have gone a long way towards paying off the house.
</li><li> This comes up in the pilot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullerHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullerHouse">Fuller House</a>. With all his daughters long since grown up and moved out, Danny is looking at selling the house, which by now in the modern San Francisco market would go for literally millions. But when DJ and her children come to visit not long after her husband's death and he sees how hard a time she is having at taking care of her kids alone, Danny and later Jessie and Joey offer to put their own plans on hold to help her out. But after Stephanie and Kimmy offer their help instead, Danny instead gives them the house to live in, setting up the premise of the revived series.
</li></ul></li><li> Near the end of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>, Reese moves into a huge apartment overlooking a park that probably has a monthly rent greater than the monthly mortgage payment of most suburban houses, which he <em>never</em> could have afforded back when he was an Army NCO or a CIA agent (The pay scale for his current job — vigilante working on behalf of reclusive billionaire — never being mentioned). Fortunately, the apartment was provided by his boss, who could easily afford to pay the rent for him (assuming Finch doesn't own the building outright). Finch also mentions in a later season that he is paying Reese a <em>lot</em>, to the point that he can pay for any lifestyle he chooses even after routinely donating most of it to charity.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>. Nobody in New York, especially not owners of a sandwich shop that seems to be perpetually half-empty, can have a house, complete with basement, parking lot, and balcony in TriBeCa. Though there could be explanation in that Jerry (the dad) seems to STILL have some very big pull in the magical world. This would help with the situation. Also, their uncle not only is magic, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Shakira</a>, so he might lend them money.
</li><li> Justified with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a> and John's flat on Baker Street, as Sherlock has helped the landlady Mrs. Hudson (by ensuring her runaway husband would be executed in the US), so she gives him a discount (unspecified, of course). On the other hand, Sherlock makes no money off his police work and frequently refuses compensation from private clients (John usually steps in and takes the money). John was only shown working once by getting a job as a local doctor... only to fall asleep in the office due to long nights investigating. He does receive pension after being discharged from the army but claims in the pilot that it's not nearly enough to afford a place in London. Also, in the pilot, Mycroft offers to pay John to spy on Sherlock (John didn't know who Mycroft was at the time). When Sherlock finds out, he berates John for refusing and later explains that Mycroft's concern was that of a brother, not an enemy. Mrs. Hudson can afford to live in a townhouse in an expensive London neighborhood because her late husband ran a drug cartel and she inherited a sizable fortune when he was executed.
</li><li> Justified with Sherlock's brownstone in New York in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em>, as his father is the one who owns the place and lets his son use it, provided Sherlock stays clean and goes through the 12-step program. Joan is hired to live with him and keep him clean, being paid enough to keep her apartment. Later, after finding out that the guy she was subletting to filmed a porn video there, she gives up the place and moves her stuff to the brownstone. As in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>, Holmes consults the NYPD for free, although he does work with private clients during downtime. After Holmes Sr. stops paying Joan for her services, Sherlock offers to pay her out of his own pocket if she stays on as his apprentice. Previously, Joan was an accomplished surgeon and, presumably, could afford a nice place. We later find out that the Holmes family is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">Fiction 500</a> wealthy and thus Sherlock's living accommodations are actually quite spartan by their standards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em> — when Reese storms/is kicked out of the house, he manages to rent a really nice apartment on an (admittedly well-paying) part-time job. However, it turns out he's paying the rent and all the expenses by credit card, and has racked up several thousand dollars debt in a matter of weeks. It's also implied in a Halloween episode that Malcolm's family can afford their house partly because its value plummeted after the man who lived in it just prior to them went insane, slaughtered his family, and decorated the place with their body parts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTenthKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTenthKingdom">The 10th Kingdom</a></em>: Virginia, a waitress, and her father Tony are able live in an apartment right next to Central Park because Tony is the janitor there and the apartment is part of his pay.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, it is unknown how Earl and Joy paid rent on their trailer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which they de-facto inherited from Earl's old roommate Frank, who went to prison</span>, considering that Earl was often between jobs (he did occasionally work various odd-jobs, but due to his problems with authority, they never lasted long), and Joy never worked at that time. (She is occasionally shown to run a nail salon out of her trailer later in the series, but it appears that she started that business <em>after</em> her marriage to Earl ended.) They stole a lot of things, but those were almost always either things like formula for the kids, or luxury items that they used but did not resell. It's subverted later, when Earl mentions that he and Joy would camp out in an abandoned RV when the bill collectors got to be too much. (It was their de-facto "vacation home.") Even though their standard of living is low, by all logic it should be lower.
<ul><li> Not that Joy's standard of living is <em>that</em> much better after she divorces Earl for her longtime lover Darnell. As a bartender or the manager of the Crab Shack, Darnell makes a base salary even below minimum wage, and this being Camden, the tip jar is often empty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>
<ul><li> Some viewers have wondered how Marley's mom can afford a two-story house when their poverty is often a plot point. However, the house could be a rental, and renting in semi-rural Ohio would cost a fraction of New York's prices.
</li><li> The Bushwick loft that the New York group live in starting in Season 4. At first it's just Rachel and Kurt, then Santana joins them but doesn't seem to pay rent. The loft is quite spacious, though the apparently low price could be justified by the fact that it's very far from Manhattan and the neighborhood is rough. Still, for a while the only one with a job is Kurt who had an internship at Vogue.com until the three of them got part time jobs at a diner. It's possible that their parents are helping them out though since they are college students. Now though Rachel and Santana have moved out so it's just Blaine and Kurt living there, and Blaine doesn't have a job (yet) so we don't know how that loft is getting paid for. Blaine's parents have been noted to be well-off enough to pay the high tuition cost at Dalton, so they probably help out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> usually justified this, one way or another. Most of the characters are established to either make enough to afford decent housing or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders">are mooching off those who can.</a> The second season shows that Grace can apparently make enough to afford a large apartment by herself, but not enough to actually furnish or clean it.
</li><li> In the pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, Emma is shown living in a spacious high-rise in downtown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston">Boston</a> that would be pricey for a bounty hunter, even one with a steady flow of assignments (which is hardly guaranteed), especially in Massachusetts where being a bounty hunter is an effectively dead job since 1980s. Once again in Season 3, with the timeline reset, Emma and Henry now reside in even more expensive NYC, in a fancier apartment. Boy, apparently New York City's got lots of bail jumpers to bring in.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graceland">Graceland</a></em> the main characters live in a spacious beach home that they could never afford. This is perfectly justified since they are federal undercover agents and the house is a safe house owned by the federal government. However, it also means that they cannot really bring any not-in-the-loop friends to the house since their cover identities could not afford the rent on a place like that and people would start asking questions. Mike can get away with this since his cover is that of a pilot on temporary assignment in LA whose expenses are covered by his airline. On the other hand Johnny is supposed to be a personal trainer and Charlie usually pretends to be a homeless junkie so they could never explain how they can afford to live there. However, Charlie only pretends to be a junkie when working a case involving drugs, in the pilot it's mentioned she tells the locals she's a trust-fund kid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CarolineInTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CarolineInTheCity">Caroline in the City</a></em>: Caroline lives in a palatial apartment in Manhattan. The number of comic strip creators (even nationally syndicated ones) who could afford that can be counted on one hand, but she appears to be one of them. (Most comic strip creators have very middle-class salaries.) It's helped by her being popular enough to have a Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon and frequently mentioning working on calendars and greeting cards as well, making it seem like Caroline has been franchised in-universe into a merchandising giant like Garfield. Richard, by contrast, lives in a squalid studio apartment that became available when the previous tenants were murdered (and is shown <em>racing</em> to the crime scene to rent it before someone else does). Annie, a perennial dancer in <em>Cats,</em> lives in a similar single-room apartment and leeches almost <em>everything</em> off Caroline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CucumberBananaTofu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CucumberBananaTofu">Cucumber Banana Tofu</a></em>: Dean and Freddie only pay £400 a month for an entire industrial building! Justified in that it's not 100% legal and their landlord is a gangster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Matt Murdock lives in a pretty large apartment in Hell's Kitchen, which has some of the highest rent prices in the United States. As a recent law school graduate who's only just starting his own practice, this place should be well outside Matt's budget. But, it's mentioned when Matt and Foggy are scouting out their space for Nelson &amp; Murdock that Hell's Kitchen saw property values drop due to damage sustained during "The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">Incident</a>". Making Matt's apartment even cheaper is its generally run-down aesthetic (notice that the minibar is made of unfinished plywood), and the bright electronic billboard across the street that shines brightly through the living room window - an eyesore for anyone with functioning eyes, but not a problem for a blind man.
<div class="indent"><strong>Karen Page:</strong> <em>[looking at the billboard]</em> Holy shit! <br/><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> Went up a year ago. I'm told that co-op there nearly rioted. Some oversight from the developer's agreement. <em>[shrugs]</em> Upside is, nobody wanted it and I got a corner apartment at a helluva discount.
</div></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">the comic</a> premiered in the 60's, Hell's Kitchen really <em>was</em> pretty ratchet, but by the 2010's, the neighborhood had gentrified considerably. But since it's so ingrained in the Daredevil mythos, moving him to, say, Newark was out of the question.
</li><li> Matt's living situation gets a bit more complicated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em>, since he's still living out of the apartment but is now an independent <em>pro bono</em> attorney, and probably earns less than he earned at Nelson &amp; Murdock. It's implied Matt received a large inheritance from Elektra upon her death at the end of Season 2. Lampshaded in "Ashes, Ashes" when Matt and Jessica Jones drop by the apartment so Matt can change into civilian clothes before they go to interview John Raymond's daughter, and Jessica asks Matt, "So you wanna tell me how a pro bono lawyer can afford a loft like this in New York City?" Like with Karen, Matt responds by telling her about the billboard, and jokes (badly) that he sometimes helps his landlord with tenants that are late with their rent. A fake Craiglist ad put out for the apartment right before the release of season 3 lists the rent as being around $2,000 a month, which ain't exactly cheap.
</li><li> Karen Page's various apartments are all large for the job she currently has. In season 1, working an entry-level job at Union Allied, her apartment is quite big, with a distinct bedroom. The writers take some steps to try and be realistic, as in season 2, she's downgraded to living in a large studio apartment, no doubt because she burned through Fisk's hush money pretty quickly, and her new job as Nelson &amp; Murdock's office manager doesn't pay as much as Union Allied did. In <em>The Defenders</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em> season 1, and <em>Daredevil</em> season 3, Karen is now living in a large, well-furnished apartment, even though she's a brand-new journalist for the <em>New York Bulletin</em> (not a high-paying job) and somehow is also paying Matt's rent on top of her own while he's missing post-Midland Circle. Some lines of dialogue do suggest that Karen is financially strained in season 3 (in the third episode, she comments when having dinner with Ellison's family that this is her first home-cooked meal in months; while her sole scene in the first episode involves her asking Foggy to help her out with paying Matt's rent).
</li><li> Of the main characters, Foggy Nelson is probably the only one who can realistically afford his apartment. While we never see his apartments in season 1 or season 2, he moves in with his girlfriend Marci Stahl after joining her at Jeri Hogarth's firm at the end of season 2. In season 3, they're shown living together in a high-rise condominium in North Williamsburg. Both of them are attorneys at Jeri Hogarth's firm, which, considering its size as depicted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>, would mean they'd both be pulling down six figure salaries.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>.
<ul><li> Justified thanks to the titular notice, Michael Westen has no job history, no credit, no bank accounts, and a decidedly irregular income. But he lives in a very large multi-level apartment in Miami, overlooking a river, that only costs him $200 a month. But it's explained in the pilot episode the apartment is actually a converted storage space above a nightclub that is not technically zoned as an apartment. Westen had to agree he was a squatter should the authorities question him and he doesn't mind the noise level because he's slept through worse over the years. Just about anyone else would. The pilot episode shows the loft in its bare-bones condition, and over the course of the first season makes some changes so that it looks halfway livable, with a fridge, kitchen counter, furniture...
</li><li> Inverted in the pilot episode, where the loft had a normal floor to ceiling height, and looked like it was little more than a converted storage space. After it went to series, the ceiling double in height and the room gained a raised platform on one end. Still looks like converted storage, as there are still club items stacked against the back wall and the place is never painted, and while we never see the bathroom, there is clearly no other separate room as Michael treats it as studio with his mattress right in the open between the door and the kitchenette area. In an early episode the landlord offers Michael a month rent-free in exchange for help with a problem, it's implied that this might not be the only time they've made such an arrangement.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Monk himself is downplayed or an odd variant of this trope. For a private investigator and consultant to the San Francisco Police Department, his apartment (1 bed, 2 bath, kitchen, dining and living rooms) is very nice for notoriously expensive San Francisco (AKA home to some of the highest rent prices on the West Coast). While Monk's personal expenses are somewhat reduced (he doesn't own or drive a car, rarely travels, does not own any high-end electronics, and has an iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">Limited Wardrobe</a>, etc.) his OCD brings about a number of other expenses many people don't have (frequent psychiatrist sessions with Dr. Kroger or Dr. Bell, a personal assistant, etc.) and others most people would find unnecessary (he only uses an umbrella only once, runs his dishwasher and washing machine too often, etc.).
</li><li> Monk's assistant Natalie Teeger plays it straight. She has money troubles from time to time due to Monk sometimes not being able to pay her in a timely fashion, she does not take money from her wealthy parents, but still, her Noe Valley house<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32ex7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32ex7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32ex7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to the Lee Goldberg and Hy Conrad novels, Natalie lives in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood</span> is much too large for herself and her daughter Julie (not to mention that the interior set doesn't look like something you might find in that part of San Francisco).
</li><li> Done in the tie-in book <em>Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants,</em> where a murder victim is a shoe salesman who lives in a converted loft apartment (also pretty expensive real estate). It's lampshaded as the characters wonder how a lowly shoe salesman is able to afford such a place.
</li><li> In "Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man," the murder victim Gwen Zaleski is an out-of-work actress who lives in a pretty nice 21st floor apartment. It's explained here that her lover Trevor McDowell, furniture showroom magnate, was paying her bills. That McDowell was about to stop paying the bills is considered by Monk as a clue that implicates him as the killer.

Marnie is forced to pay the full rent after Hannah loses her parental funding. While paying half would be possible, it's way too much of a stretch for Marnie to pay the full amount given that her art gallery job would pay no more than $30,000 per year and she gets only limited family support. Played up even more in the final two seasons when Hannah and Elijah occupy it, one episode reveals Hannah only earns $24,000 a year, while it's ambiguous if Elijah has a job, he last worked as a barista for Ray and would leave work early on whims.
</li><li> The short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> TV adaptation justified Harry's surprisingly nice home in Chicago as the only thing on which he spent any of his inheritance from his well-off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in Season 1, Jake lives in a large, pleasant apartment despite being <em>terrible</em> with money (to the point where he's implied to have declared bankruptcy at least once) — it's quickly explained that it was his grandmother's apartment, and that he still benefits from the rent control she negotiated decades earlier (Jake and Gina both refer to having spent time in the apartment during childhood; they're now in their early thirties). Furthermore, almost as soon as the apartment appears on-screen it's revealed that he's about to lose it because the building is about to become a co-op and he can't afford to purchase the place. In the end, Gina puts a down payment on the apartment for herself, but this time it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the fact that she's been renting the same one-room studio for over ten years and saving up until a nicer place came along.
</li><li> And when you actually see Gina's old apartment (which becomes Jake's new place), the set <em>is</em> actually about as small as they could make it while still allowing space to actually film the scene. For bonus points, you never see more than three actors in a scene in Gina's/Jake's apartment, presumably because there's no more floor space for them all to stand up at once without obstructing the camera.
</li><li> Amy's apartment is also larger than might be expected for a single person living on a detective's salary: though none of the rooms are large it has a separate dining room and is implied to have a spare bedroom (since the squad mistakenly believe she lives with her grandmother). However, Amy is explicitly stated to be Jake's exact opposite in her attitude to money, and it's completely in-character for her to be so good at budgeting that she's able to afford a nice place for herself.
</li><li> Rosa also lives in a very nice and spacious apartment that is well-furnished and fully decorated. Complicating matters is the fact that she's so paranoid about her personal information being revealed that she's set up an intricate financial maze under false identities and shell corporations, which adds to the cost of the already-expensive NYC rent.

The parents are a Catholic school coach and a homemaker. Especially bad as a running theme is that the family is struggling financially. It's indicated that the school provided the family with the house. And even if not, it's also implied that it isn't the nicest of places — the four oldest sisters share an attic bedroom, son JR shares with his baby brother, and youngest daughter Sherry shares with her baby sister.
</li><li> Tony DiNozzo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> lives in a very nice apartment for a guy living on a cop's salary. Late in Season 13, McGee does some digging and learns that not only does Tony own the apartment outright but he bought it back when he was still a probationary agent and thus was not making much money. It turns out that Tony paid well below market price for the apartment since it was once the site of a gruesome triple homicide, after which nobody wanted to live there anymore. Tony was able to get the place cheap and put a grand piano on top of a large bloodstain that couldn't be completely cleaned. Tim then informs Tony that if Tony wanted to sell the apartment, enough time has passed since the murders that he is no longer legally required to inform potential buyers of its sordid history and thus could get full market value for it. In the following season, a subplot of one episode is the team quarreling over who gets to lease that apartment from Tony's dad after Tony leaves the team and the country. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tim ends up with it, partially because he and his fiancee Deliah need the extra space.</span> A season later, new agent Nick Torres laments that back when he did undercover work in South America, he could get a gorgeous apartment for $400 US a month. The cost of living in the DC Metro area is <em>much</em> higher.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> lampshades this in one episode, where Zelda alludes to the fact that the neighbours are suspicious that she and Hilda are able to afford such a fancy Victorian house in Massachusetts — when Hilda is a struggling violinist and Zelda doesn't actually work until the fifth season. The aunts can afford whatever they want by having held onto various things over the centuries until they turn valuable.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> <em>The City</em> (a reworking of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Loving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Loving">Loving</a></em>), the survivors of the Corinth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> move to an apartment building in New York City's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoHo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoHo">So Ho</a> neighborhood. Aside from this building implausibly being able to house a bar, medical clinic, fashion studio, and several apartments, there is no way <em>any</em>of the people living there (with the exception of the woman who owned the building) could have afforded to, even with a roommate, as several tenants were shown to have.
</li><li> The number of characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastenders">Eastenders</a></em> who could afford to live <em>anywhere</em> in London is almost microscopic.

</li><li> Characters on their ITV rival <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> just <em>barely</em> avert this, according to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a845709/albert-square-actually-really-expensive-eastenders-coronation-street/">this study<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of housing costs on British soaps. Living conditions would be a lot more spartan than shown on screen, however.
</li><li> The Gifford family in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdFeet">Cold Feet</a></em> live in a large, well-appointed (if slightly run-down) house in London which they apparently own, despite their low income. Averted to varying extents by the other characters, whose vaguely defined careers are implied to be well-paid.
</li><li> Referenced and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>. Early in Season 4, when Fitz and Simmons were looking for an apartment together, Daisy, having gone off the grid to protect fellow Inhumans, lured Simmons into helping her by emailing her an ad for a rather nice apartment, commenting that Simmons was "always a sucker for a breakfast nook." As Daisy was always the lead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> for Fitz and Simmons, she did promise Simmons that the apartment was theirs if they wanted it, adding "And it's rent-controlled."

While most of the staff quit, the building itself should still cost quite a lot just to keep the lights on, but they are still producing a number of inventions to help the Flash, and Harrison Wells is shown to still maintain a lavish home outside the lab, all without any high-profile contracts. Apparently the lab is still generating money somehow. Fans have theorized that they are receiving consulting fees from the police, royalties when the police use their technology, and perhaps more royalties on other existing patents, but it's never explained outright. When Barry inherits the lab, his own lifestyle immediately improves, and he takes his girlfriend to an expensive restaurant and later buys a <em>very</em> nice apartment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl (2015)</a></em>: Kara has a very nice apartment in the middle of the city, which she lives in alone, despite starting out as a low-paid assistant and going on to be a low-paid journalist. Of course, her sister is a secret government agent and her mother a successful scientist, so they might have been helping. In season 4, Kara mentions that it's rent-controlled.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked on the American television version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnimalKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnimalKingdom">Animal Kingdom</a></em> where the Codys own a number of apartment buildings around Oceanside and rent them out at a fraction of the going market rate. It's actually a money laundering scheme. The Codys make most of their money through armed robbery and similar crimes and need a way to justify their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousSpending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousSpending">Suspicious Spending</a>. On paper the tenants pay just under market rate in rent and all the tenants will swear that this is what they really pay. Thus the Codys can claim that their money comes from rental income and pay their taxes on it like normal citizens. The secondary effect of this scheme is to generate a lot of local goodwill for the Codys and makes the locals less likely to inform on the Codys to the police. One elderly lady has been part of the scheme for years, never had her actual rent raised and is paying about 5% of what her lease says she is supposed to pay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> actually inverts this in principle, as Leonard and Sheldon are collegiate physicists living together in Pasadena. In fact, some have argued they are living well below their income level. It's implied at several points that the two of them don't make particularly great money even though it should be well above average (a season one episode Sheldon says "If I could afford it I wouldn't have YOU as a roommate"). It's been proposed that the reason neither of them sought a nicer place was primarily due to Sheldon's dislike of change—he <em>could</em> find something better, but then he'd have to get used to it all over again. Sheldon is also a frugal spender who doesn't care much for luxury, so he's probably happy with a modest living quarters. And Leonard's long-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> with Penny made for a good reason to keep him living in the same building with her; if he moved elsewhere, he would see her less.
<ul><li> Penny, on the other hand, lives next door as a waitress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingForABreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingForABreak">Waiting for a Break</a> and her ability to make rent is frequently questioned (she was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Perpetual Poverty</a> and regularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders">bummed off Leonard and Sheldon for food, wifi and other things</a>). Though her apartment is smaller than Leonard and Sheldon's, having one bedroom and one bathroom as opposed to their two bedroom, one bath apartment, which would make it cheaper.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em> didn't start out this way with Alan being a grocery store manager and Amy flip flopping between housewife and realtor. However, after deciding on having the Amy being a homemaker, Eric &amp; Cory going off to college, and a fourth baby on the way you saw this trope being played straight. It also made Alan not being immediately happy after hearing Amy was pregnant again as being a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedWrongness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedWrongness">Informed Wrongness</a>.
</li><li> Deconstructed with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em>. The Conners had an older but reasonably spacious two-story home with a basement even though the parents worked a series of low-paying jobs and suffered extended periods of unemployment, but the home was heavily mortgaged and being unable to pay the bills was a real concern. The series made it quite clear that the family really <em>wasn't</em> able to "afford" their home and were constantly struggling to make ends meet - all the way back to when they bought it, and had to borrow money from Roseanne's parents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KimsConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KimsConvenience">Kim's Convenience</a></em>, Janet and Gerald's apartment seems surprisingly spacious and decent considering both are college students that only have casual jobs at best (with Janet not even getting paid since it's her parents' convenience store). The one possibility for them being able to afford the place is Janet's parents Mr. and Mrs. Kim helping out since they don't want their daughter living in an unsafe cheap place (and Mr. Kim is more than keen for his house to finally be offspring-free). Jung and Kimchi's apartment is debatable; it appears to be a one-bedroom plus a den repurposed as a second bedroom, which would be much cheaper than a proper two-bedroom, but still expensive for a couple of car rental customer service employees even in the least pricey neighbourhoods of Toronto.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>
<ul><li> Frasier himself is a somewhat downplayed example, as he does have a presumably well-paying job as a radio host. However, his condo is extremely spacious and well-furnished with swanky designer furniture and art, making many viewers wonder how he could afford it even on a six-figure salary. Even in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, local AM talk radio personalities weren't millionaires. (For reference, the furniture for the actual set cost about $500,000.) And since Frasier had just come off a divorce when he moved in, and is a spendthrift who lives a very luxurious lifestyle, it's unlikely that he has any additional income from savings or investments.
</li><li> Niles is a curious example. He's a psychiatrist like Frasier (although in private practice) but has been living well above his means due to being married to Maris, who is a millionaire. Once they begin divorce proceedings, Niles moves into a luxurious apartment at the Montana (a very exclusive building that even Frasier couldn't get into) that has three stories, a library, a study and a gift-wrapping room. However, Maris soon cuts Niles off from her finances, resulting in him no longer being able to afford his rent thanks to his legal bills draining most of his salary. He has to temporarily move into a studio apartment at the Shangri-La while subletting his Montana apartment. Fortunately thanks to his new lawyer Donny Douglas, Niles gets a healthy settlement in the divorce and returns to the Montana.

In season 6, however, they moved to Burbank, taking an apartment that had a living room larger than their entire Milwaukee apartment - before starting working, and having maybe $100 in savings.

Justified in that Max was illegally subletting the apartment from an old man who didn't live there anymore. That being said, the apartment isn't really that great. There's only one bedroom, and the utilities are either broken down or dangerous, and the neighborhood they live in is in a very bad part of New York.

It's stated that their frenemy Marina had the place as one of her safehouses. She lets the magicians stay there, and she has so little regard for the place that she doesn't kick them out even after they come into conflict with her. It's stated <em>once</em> that the group pays rent by running errands for the magical being that owns the building, which is fortunate because most of the characters don't have regular jobs.

When Sutton transfers to the fashion department and learns that it comes with an unexpected pay cut, she realizes that she would not be able to afford her half of the rent and Jane would need to sublet her room in order to cover the payments. Although, as the showrunner admitted in an interview, it is a <em>nice</em> shared apartment.

Shirou is an orphaned high school student who works several part-time jobs; and he certainly didn't have enough of an inheritance to afford such a place. The VN explains that the house is actually owned by the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> syndicate; Shirou's father Kiritsugu had rented it from them, and after his passing they allow Shirou to stay there as a favor to Kiritsugu.

Some episodes draw attention to it though.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in "Homer's Enemy":
<div class="indent"><strong>Frank Grimes</strong>: <em>(in awe)</em> Good Heavens! This is a palace! H-How can, how in the world can you afford to live in a house like this, Simpson? <br/><strong>Homer</strong>: I dunno. Don't ask me how the economy works.

Plus, Springfield is considered in-universe to be a crappy place to live, which could drive down prices.
</li><li> The creators have also been known to state that they've deliberately kept the precise layout of the Simpsons' home vague and inconsistent, so it's hard to tell how big it really is.

</li><li> Flanders has a very nice house with a very spacious and lavish rumpus room in the basement, but in an early episode is stated to only make $27 a week more than Homer does before going into business for himself.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissionHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissionHill">Mission Hill</a></em>: Andy is working at a water mattress store at (presumably) just above minimum wage, Posey is just...there, and no one knew what Jim did for a living until Kevin came along, yet they live in a very spacious apartment (with a second floor!) in a decent building with neighbours they like, in a part of town that doesn't seem run down or depressed. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyWealthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyWealthy">Jim is revealed to be a highly paid corporate executive</a> with tons of clout for basically being a computer whiz. This isn't revealed until Andy loses his job and a tooth, and Jim lets him use his health insurance to have it fixed, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeverAsked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeverAsked">Andy never asked</a> — even though he's Jim's best and oldest friend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></em>: Mac's apartment is fairly spacious, despite the fact that he lives with his single mother who's supporting him and his brother. His father is presumed dead (as opposed to divorced or separated), so she probably doesn't get child support or alimony. It's also revealed that the enormous, titular Foster's Home gets donations (in reference to a house that feeds and provides room &amp; board for hundreds of imaginary friends). Although when Mac fibs about there being no hot water, his mom passes it off as one of the problems with their home. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">She doesn't object to him turning on the AC though shortly afterward.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>: The alien trio move into a large house outside downtown Sherman (similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>). How do they afford it? Why Octus is able to create<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4qh75');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4qh75" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4qh75');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">sounds nicer than "counterfeit"</span> money to pay for it as opposed to applying for a home loan. ("Fine. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Everyone</a></em> pays for houses in cash.")
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em>
<ul><li> Played with: Bugs and Daffy live in a very nice house in a neighborhood where almost everyone (excluding Yosemite Sam) appear to be rather pleasant, if a bit eccentric. While Daffy is stated to have no job and very poor credit, Bugs, however, is revealed to have invented the carrot peeler and most, if not all of his money stems from the royalties.
</li><li> In the episode "Peel of Fortune," Daffy bought the house (based on royalties from an automatic carrot peeler he stole from Bugs) and lets Bugs live with him. However, Daffy's demands causes Bugs to lose it and he storms out. He is forced to move back into his old rabbit hole from the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoons. He finds the experience unpleasant, after years of suburban lifestyle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo is restored</a> when the schematic Daffy stole and mass-produced turns out to have an irreparable defect: overnight, Daffy's once again a freeloader and Bugs' manual-carrot-peeler royalties are rolling in again.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>, both SpongeBob and Squidward live in nice two-story houses and are able to furnish them while still affording food and everything they need for their hobbies. This is despite the fact that they work for a fast food joint run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Mr. Krabs</a>, who would make them pay him if he could get away with it, and SpongeBob had his house even before he was employed at all. The most logical conclusion is that they don't pay for their homes at all; "Home Sweet Pineapple" shows SpongeBob's house simply grows (complete with furniture and everything...) while Squidward perhaps, like most sea creatures in real life, simply found an abandoned Easter Island Head and made it his home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears">We Bare Bears</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a>. The bears live in a renovated cave they paid nothing for, at least some of their furniture is hand-made, they either walk (often in "bearstack" mode) or use public transportation, and numerous episodes show they make very little money. That said, this doesn't stop them from getting an Internet connection, cell phones, laptops, television, a fridge, and they still have plenty of free time to do whatever the plot requires.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom">Ruby Gloom</a></em>: Ruby and her friends live in a large mansion on a large amount of property, despite having no visible source of income whatsoever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs">Super Noobs</a></em>: Alien warriors Memnock and Zenblock move into a house in the second episode, which is a two story house that is fairly spacious and well kept. However, Memnock and Zenblock apparently have no job besides being virus warriors so its unknown how they are able to afford to keep living in it, let alone being able to buy other things. Ironically this spacious house turned out to be too small for them due to their large size and this problem caused them to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudEpisode">Feud Episode</a> until the Noobs decide to add more spacious high tech rooms underneath the house in order to end the feud. Its speculated that the Benevolent Alliance supplies Memnock and Zenblock with the funds they need to afford the house smother can continue staying in it and be able to train the noobs.
</li><li> Elisa Maza of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> lives alone in a fairly spacious loft apartment in Soho on a detective's salary, while simultaneously buying amenities for the Manhattan Clan. Given that she is half-Native American, it's possible that she receives reparations money as well, but it can still seem fairly ridiculous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>. Steven only lives in his very nice (if small) home because it was built and integrated into the Crystal Gems' base (which is clearly not owned by any human) <em>by</em> the Crystal Gems, expressly for him to live in. His father, Greg, supports him in ways other than housing, but only barely manages to do so by effectively living out of the tiny car wash he runs, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">he receives an unexpected windfall of cash</a> from a 10 million dollar royalty check for a song he wrote in his brief music career.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> initially seems to play this straight, as the Treehouse seems <em>way</em> too large and lavish for a jobless kid and his talking dog/adoptive brother to afford and maintain, especially given that the show is set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>. But it soon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">turns out</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffluentAscetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffluentAscetic">the Treehouse is downright spartan for Finn and Jake</a>, as they're rich enough to crash economies by themselves with the massive hoard of treasure, artifacts, and weaponry they've built up from years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling">Dungeon Crawling</a> and monster-slaying. The only reason they aren't living in a straight-up castle is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">they don't care enough</a> to <em>spend</em> much of that money, seeing it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> that comes secondary to the adventure itself. It's implied that this is a common situation for adventurers; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Billy</a> is even wealthier than Finn and Jake, yet lives in a dank cave that isn't furnished with anything other than his loot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>: Given their status as presumably self employed scientists working in a very specific field, and universally regarded as quacks, it is unclear exactly how the Fenton's could afford to construct all their various inventions, including a gateway to an alternate dimension and multiple vehicles, let alone their house.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> New York City's rent control laws have allowed long-time tenants to hold onto <em>insanely</em> low rents as the city has become increasingly expensive. <a class="urllink" href="http://nypost.com/2012/03/18/soho-seniors-spend-as-little-as-55-a-month-for-rent-controlled-apartments/">Two longtime tenants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Manhattan's trendy SoHo neighborhood paid $55 and $71 a month where the average rent for a one bedroom apartment is over $2,500. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/14/us/new-york-apartment-rent-control-actress-trnd/index.html">One woman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> paid only $28 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village she had been renting for 63 years, estimated to go for $5,000 on the open market.
</li><li> A similar thing happened in California. A proposition passed during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">the 1970s</a> that limited how much property tax could increase. This meant however that property values had to be reassessed. Though everyone who owned property before then were grandfathered in at their current rate. This means in some areas, there are some property owners who are paying a fraction of the tax that everyone else would be if they purchased property today.
</li><li> A variant for American military personnel living off-post in friendly nations. The US military will provide a housing allowance, allowing personnel to live in nicer homes they'd otherwise be unable to afford on their salaries.
