</div></div><p>Two characters can be competing for the same goal, without one of them even aware of the competition. Maybe the reason they haven't picked up on the rivalry is that it is hard to take their rival seriously. Maybe the rival simply hasn't shown up onscreen at the same time. It might just be that the rival is so much weaker, that they can't be considered a serious threat. Whatever the reason, the rival is competing for the same thing as the other character. Objectives for competition may be the fair maiden's hand, simple revenge, a pot of gold, the title of "World's Best Whatever", or the extra-special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> of the week.

<ul><li> Part-time model Sakiyama Kaori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Airmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Airmaster">Airmaster</a></em> becomes an amateur wrestler, semi-berserker streetfighter solely to challenge Aikawa Maki. Downplayed in that she is too loud and crazed to fully ignore, to the point everyone memetically mentions her full name when she appears.
</li><li> Sakaki never notices Kagura's self-proclaimed rivalry, even when it is proclaimed to her face, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>. Despite that, Kagura doesn't take their rivalry personally and is nice to Sakaki even before they get to know each other. Kagura eventually moves on to establish a genuine rivalry with Tomo, as both have similar levels of energy.
</li><li> Momoko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChouKuseNiNarisou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChouKuseNiNarisou">Chou Kuse ni Narisou</a></em> considers Nagisa to be her rival, but Nagisa doesn't learn of Momoko's identity until the second half of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, Near blatantly ignores Mello's attempts to beat him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ironically, Not So Harmless Mello ends up actually helping in the end, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDeathIsJustTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDeathIsJustTheBeginning">his own death</a>.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld">El-Hazard: The Magnificent World</a></em> OVA, Makoto is largely unaware of Katsuhiko Jinnai's hatred for him; in fact he considers Jinnai a friend. Whereas Jinnai thinks that Makoto has a secret vendetta against <em>him</em>, given the number of times that Makoto has coincidentally gotten in his way and/or pissed him off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> has Sougo Okita, the 1st captain of the Shinsengumi, constantly trying to kill his superior, vice-commander Toshiro Hijikata, just so he can take over his vice-commander position. Hijikata, in turn, never seems to take notice of any of this (even regarding Okita's attempts on his life as "unfunny pranks").
</li><li> During most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em>, Maya is unaware that Ayumi sees her as a huge threat to her acting career. And as result, Ayumi sees her as the main rival. Maya, instead, sees Ayumi as an inspiration worth looking up to. It's not until near the end of the Anime series that Maya realizes this when Ayumi, herself, admits it.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Once Ayumi confessed that she was thinking about letting Maya fall off a weak wooden bridge and die, but saved her at the last minute, the two end up fighting. Afterwards, they both declare each other rivals.</span>
</li><li> Ryuuka, the pompous rich leader of the Jihiyou rival house in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HanaukyoMaidTai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HanaukyoMaidTai">Hanaukyō Maid Tai</a></em>. In episodes 7 and 11 of the first series Taro doesn't know who she is, even though he met her in episode 4.
</li><li> Yadano Makeru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KomiCantCommunicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KomiCantCommunicate">Komi Can't Communicate</a></em> sees herself as a rival to Komi, and is constantly trying to beat her in "competitions". Not only does she always lose, but Komi never realizes there was a competition in the first place.
</li><li> Variation: Haitani and Shirai, Urashima Keitaro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">best friends at the beginning</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>, disappear for a while once the plot gets going. Eventually, they reappear just to "see how Keitaro's doing", that is to say, mess up his life more. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the manga has the other characters constantly asking who they are and how they know Keitaro.
</li><li> This trope is justified and deconstructed with protagonist Miki Onimaru of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume">Muteki Kanban Musume</a></em> who can never remember Kankuro Nishiyama, despite his attempting to serve her with a formal challenge to battle nearly every episode. Justified because Miki is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolYardBullyAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolYardBullyAllGrownUp">School Yard Bully All Grown Up</a> who suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">But for Me, It Was Tuesday</a>. And deconstructed because as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSeries">Fighting Series</a> protagonist, Miki always encounters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitPartBadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitPartBadGuys">Bit Part Bad Guys</a>/ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryPunchableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryPunchableMan">Very Punchable Men</a> that defy her, she promptly defeats and immediately forgets about; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">why should Kankuro be different than them?</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Todoroki is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> of the class, so Bakugo declares him the one to be defeated. Todoroki does acknowledge Bakugo's skills, but thinks his rival is Midoriya. During the Sports Festival Arc, Todoroki and Midoriya become rivals, while Bakugo becomes the third wheel for their rivalry doing his best just to get the attention of either. Later, when Midoriya and Todoroki become friends, Bakugo is still trying to get Todoroki to be his rival.
</li><li> Bakugo also, in the beginning at least, constantly sees Midoriya as some kind of rival, but Midoriya never notices and treats him as a friend. Eventually after some character development, his view of Midoriya wears down into a more friendly rivalry, and Midoriya reciprocates.
</li><li> Endeavor holds a deep grudge over being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a> to All Might, and when he found himself unable to surpass him, he turned to his children in the hopes they would surpass him and All-Might later on. Despite All Might's attempts to be friendly, Endeavor holds nothing but contempt for him, convinced that All Might looks down on him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When All Might is forced to retire due to his injuries and Endeavor gets the number one hero spot by default, Endeavor finally calms down. He even asks All Might what it means to be the Symbol of Peace, and begins helping All Might's successor train</span>.
</li><li> An unusual example between Mirio and Midoriya, as <em>neither</em> of them knew each other until much later, or that there was even a competition to begin with. Before All Might picked Midoriya, Mirio was top pick to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">his successor</a>, but Midoriya didn't find out about this until long after he had already received All Might's power, and Mirio remains completely unaware. Although after finding out, Midoriya does begin comparing himself unfavourably to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Mirio</a>, not helped by Sir Nighteye trying to convince Midoriya to give the power to Mirio.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> An interesting variation occurs with Might Guy to Kakashi. Guy is the intense one, and whenever he brings up the "rivalry" Kakashi says something to the effect of "I'm sorry; did you say something?" Kakashi knows full well that Guy wants an intense rivalry, but puts on an act of indifference because he doesn't terribly want to <em>be</em> Guy's rival, and really wishes they could interact normally. That's why, when Kakashi chooses their "competitions", he tends to pick something that will be over quickly and doesn't take any effort, like rock-paper-scissors.
</li><li> Humorously, Guy has Kisame as a genuinely unknown rival of his own. Guy can <em>vaguely</em> remember him, but never remembers his name <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Kisame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">kills himself.</a></span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danzou</span> was fiercely envious of the Third Hokage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He had a severe inferiority complex towards Sarutobi, especially during a flashback where he wasn't able to volunteer himself for a suicidal mission sacrificing his life for the rest of his teammates, but Sarutobi did. In his eyes, Danzou wasn't able to live up to his family's and his own beliefs. Not to mention the Second Hokage naming Sarutobi as his successor in front of Danzou, something he had longed for and bitterly desired for the rest of his life</span>. At the same time, he did respect the Third and was even on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with him. Which is actually kind of a big deal, because he ends up being the first person to use the Third's name - <em>nobody</em> else is shown to be on a first-name basis with him, not even his former squad or <em>his own son</em>.
</li><li> Naruto himself was this to Sasuke at the beginning of the manga, as he was constantly trying to outdo Sasuke, but Sasuke didn't really care about him. As he got stronger, Sasuke eventually acknowledged him. Unfortunately, to Sasuke, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">if Naruto could challenge him, it meant his own skills were inadequate</a>, which contributed significantly to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>.
</li><li> Kiba has become this to Naruto (moreso in the anime, but it's there in the manga, too). Is it simply being ashamed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a>? Or is it just because the whole "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFoxAndTheHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFoxAndTheHound">The Fox and the Hound</a></em>" bit is supposed to be funny? Or is it simply because the two are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">hot-headed, impulsive and ambitious</a>? Taking it even further, he's even expressed a desire to be Hokage just like Naruto.

Not only are they both unaware that Boa hates them for being the sole women on Luffy's crew and are thus that much closer to him, but they also have yet to even meet her in <em>person</em>. Not to mention that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Luffy</a> doesn't have romantic feelings for <em>anyone</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">Buggy</a> perceives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Shanks</a> as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">Sitcom Arch-Nemesis</a>, who he blames for making him eat a devil fruit and losing his ability to swim. Disregarding the <em>huge</em> discrepancy in strength, Shanks is either completely unaware or selectively oblivious to this, thinking that they're still the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> they've always been since they were kids.

Subverted in Sinnoh, where Jessie was a more legitimate competition for Dawn, while Kalos zigzags this, since while Jessie was also competent in showcases, Serena still barely noticed her, if more because they rarely interacted, the latter preferring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival">friendlier competition</a>.

A big part of this is because Naga, for all her talents, happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">several orders of magnitude flakier</a> than Lina, which leads to her undercutting her own effectiveness. The fact that Naga introduced herself to Lina by suddenly challenging her out of nowhere, proclaiming they were rivals when they had never even met before is another reason for Lina's lack of interest. The fact that Naga introduced herself by <em>setting fire to the Inn where they were staying</em> and then fell into the fire herself convinced Lina that Naga did not have both oars in the water right from the start.

Hisa then told Mihoko that her right eye was pretty, and Mihoko wanted to see her again to talk with her.

Hayato spends much of the series angsting over how much better a pilot Amuro is and desperately trying to prove that he's just as good (unfortunately for Hayato, Amuro is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> and leaves him in the dust from the start). Amuro never realizes any of this is going on, being much more preoccupied with his own issues and rivalry with Char. In a sense this is also the case for Amuro and Char's rivalry, at least at first - Char does recognize the strength of the Gundam and Amuro's growing potential, but doesn't see him as any specific threat and only focuses on him because of the interest Zeon as a whole has in getting the overpowered and undefeatable Gundam out of the picture; in fact, he meets Amuro face-to-face at one point and helps him out of a ditch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Lalah sacrifices herself to protect Char from Amuro</a> when they meet in battle again over Solomon.

In their earlier battle, Yzak just viewed Kira (as the Strike's pilot) as a normal enemy that he must shoot down, but then in one battle Kira badly damaged Yzak's Duel and injured him to the point he got a large scar on his face. As a result, he hated Kira down to his deepest heart, counting his scar as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfShame">Mark of Shame</a> that reminds him of Kira (and Strike particularly).

They do meet briefly, but don't know who each other is. This means that they only know each other by their actions in battle, and Shinn in particular without knowing of Kira's kind shy nature, believes that he's either evil or crazy and either way a very arrogant person that needs to be put down. Kira doesn't think much of Shinn at all, and when Shinn changes machines, doesn't initially even realize it's him he's fighting (while Shinn interesting immediately correctly assumes the guy piloting the brand new Strike Freedom is still Kira). When Shinn meets him again and is told who he is, the idea that this kind man was the guy he was fighting kills any remaining notion that his side was correct.
<ul><li> Averted with Shinn and Athrun, and in fact pitted against someone that he couldn't write off as a faceless guy who he could believe to be evil (because Shinn knew Athrun was a good person at heart), Shinn couldn't quite muster up his usual performance.

This appears to have happened just a week or so earlier and it's hard to imagine that week being so jam-packed with excitement that Mugen would lose track of all the guys he maimed. Second is in the three part finale, where the three brothers crippled by Mugen during the raid on the sugar ship converge on him; leader Umanosuke loses his mind even more than Ryujiro did when he hears Mugen has no idea what he's talking about. Again, it's hardly unreasonable to expect him to remember this since the sugar ship raid is one of the major formative experiences of his recent life.

In the Mahora Festival arc, she's all about "punishing" Negi for being an irresponsible teacher and is kinda boisterous about showing how much better she is. Needless to say, she's always defeated (and naked) almost every time she insists on picking a fight with him.

Kuwabara was obsessed with defeating Yusuke, but it took a few fights before Yusuke even started to remember his name. When the series begins, Yusuke still doesn't consider Kuwabara a serious rival, since he easily wins every single fight. Eventually, Kuwabara abandons the rivalry and becomes friends with Yusuke, more focused on getting through the Dark Tournament and then the Black Chapters crisis alive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em>, the protagonist is pursued by Dr. Gel of the Gogol Empire for reasons unclear.

The rematch with Hol Horse and Boingo is sort of a step-up, because at least Polnareff realizes that Hol Horse (and <em>only</em> Hol Horse) is trying to kill them. Iggy also attacks Boingo, but only because he accidentally hit Iggy with a crate and not because he found out Boingo's a Stand user.
</li><li> Emi and Takeshi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em> are both this to Kousei, at least before they reunite in the story.

Though Saitama gives him some acknowledgement and understands his intentions, he doesn't seem at all interested in him and forgets his name shortly after their first encounter, seeing him more as a pest than a serious opponent.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>. It's not that Sakura doesn't know Syaoran is rivalling her for the Clow Cards, she's even a bit genuinely intimidated by it, just she doesn't understand why it's a rivalry for the large part. She even thanks Syaoran for helping her collect some or even gives him ones she believes he earned more. This complete lack of animosity eventually wears down Syaoran's competitive streak until he's more just her ally.

This conflict culminated in a coup against Galvatron from which he recovered and killed Sixshot, ironically before Optimus even knew of his existance.

Episode 10 implies that Victor actually left because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he got infatuated with Yuri Katsuki on the night of the Grand Prix Final banquet</span>, and he isn't actually sure who J.J. is or what his nickname stands for.

While he says this to anyone who'll listen, even the Guardians play along with him despite their fanatical, kill-those-with-insufficient-loyalty mentality (although it's possible they see him as untouchable because he was made by one of the original players). If Ainz has even heard of him, he doesn't show it (though it helps that Eclair's plan once he's in charge involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">keeping the place absolutely spotless</a>).

<ul><li> Slyde. For a moment he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> on the ropes! Read the issue (Spider Man Unlimited v3 #1, for the record), it's very entertaining. And in this case, Spider-Man <em>does</em> know who Slyde <em>is</em>; you don't have a guy as a decently recurring enemy for years without remembering him. He just regards him as little more than an occasional nuisance.
</li><li> There's a similar scene in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Shocker</a> manages to capture Spider-Man. Throughout the series, he was played up as a joke, a character who didn't even really qualify as a supervillain that Spidey would easily subdue in the opening pages of an arc to show "business as usual." While he has Spider-Man hanging upside-down he reveals that from his point of view, things weren't nearly so funny, revealing a level of anger and humiliation made only worse by the fact that Spider-Man never gave him a second thought.
</li><li> In Eddie Brock's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Venom">Venom</a>'s original backstory, he was just a reporter whose shoddy journalism was exposed by Spider-Man. Eddie Brock claimed to have interviewed the Sin-eater, but it turns out the guy was just a compulsive confessor, and Spidey caught the real criminal. Eddie snapped and held a grudge against Spider-Man that only got worse after bonding with the Venom symbiote. At this time Spidey had never even met Eddie face to face.
</li><li> This Trope was combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">What Measure Is a Mook?</a> in the story "Light the Night", a rather dramatic multipart story involving Electro. A subplot of the story dealt with a mugger who Spidey had caught on numerous occasions, but could <em>never</em> remember from one time to the next. The guy hated Spider-Man, not so much because he kept getting punched out and webbed to the wall; he even said he wouldn't mind so much if, for once, Spidey <em>remembered who he was!</em> Eventually, the guy tries to pull a grandiose stunt and rob a high-class party, pretending to be a super-villain (doing a rather lame job of it), and when Spidey shows up, again, he seems enraged by his "arch-enemy's" presence, but Spidey has no-idea who he is. It becomes a moot point a minute later, as Electro tries to pull an even <em>bigger</em> stunt that threatens to wipe out the entire city block. Still, the story ends somewhat happy for the guy; he runs into a beautiful socialite from the party who doesn't recognize him as the criminal, and they hit it off quickly. But when Spidey walks by them on the last page - in his civilian identity as Peter - he <em>still</em> doesn't recognize him. (Maybe he just had a forgettable face...)
</li><li> During one story, he is attacked by C-list villain Will O'the Wisp. Spider-Man's response is "And you are...?" Wisp gives a rundown of every encounter they've had, to which Spider-Man repeatedly responds that he doesn't remember any of this. Subverted by Spidey's narration, where he reveals that he knows perfectly well who Will O'the Wisp is, and is just messing with him.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Acts of Vengeance</em> storyline was all about this. During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> which focused primarily on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> but involved most other heroes, members of the super-hero community were subject to attacks by villains they had never fought before or barely even knew- ie. the Mandarin, normally Iron Man's arch-foe, instead battled the X-Men. In fact, most of the villains in question didn't even know the true reason; some had simply been hired out by the masterminds behind the true plot, others had been duped into doing so. (The true scheme was a plot by Loki to destroy the Avengers once and for all by recruiting a council of powerful and influential villains, but they fell apart due to infighting.)
</li><li> Kearson DeWitt put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, or rather Tony Stark, through six kinds of hell during the "Armor Wars II" storyline; he was commissioned by the Marrs twins to take Tony out, but for him it is clearly, indeed emphatically personal. He rants and raves at Stark for some cruel injustice that was done to him - but when the story finally comes to a head, and - after a long and devastating battle - DeWitt's face is revealed to Tony, he does not recognize him. Atypically for the trope, this shocks him profoundly. The idea was that DeWitt was one of the many guys Tony crushed during his selfish rise to power and while DeWitt remembers it clearly, Tony never even knew the guy's name.
<ul><li> In the later three-annual-crossover "Assault on Armor City", it is revealed (in retcon, natch) that DeWitt is the son of an unrecognized engineering genius, whose designs - DeWitt believes - were stolen by Stark and formed the basis for Iron Man, while the true inventor died 'a broken and penniless man'. It's kind of a bum move which pulls the sting out of the original story.

After a 3rd release from prison, he tracks down Rick Jones and destroys his house with a bazooka.

At first, Slade can't believe this entire rampage of murder is "over me stealing a girl 20 years ago" but Walsh reveals it's even bigger. Getting a closer look, Slade realizes Walsh was Jackal, the terrorist who had slit the throat of Slade's son, Joe, rendering him mute. To top it all off, an injured Jackal then joined the group HIVE and recruited Slade's other son, Grant to become the first Ravager, which got him killed.

Socially, his classmate's ability to incite the rest of his group during the sports festival and U.S.J. incident was so great that, when combined with the inspiring figure Hikigaya portrayed during the singles bout, Midoriya couldn't help but favorably compare Hachiman to the Symbol of Peace himself. For a more comedic example, what Midoriya actually finds most impressive is Hachiman's ability to casually talk to girls and converse with Bakugo without getting his head bit off.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> has a couple of possible examples.
<ul><li> Cersei very definitely sees Margaery Tyrell as a rival, but it is not clear whether Margaery is actually trying to undermine Cersei or not. It is certainly true that Margaery's family is trying to increase their power at Cersei's expense, but it is unknown if Margaery is knowingly assisting in their schemes, or is genuinely trying to be friendly with Cersei and is upsetting her largely by accident. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The latter seems unlikely, since she is shrewd enough to immediately see through Cersei's plan to get her damned in trial by combat, and calls her a "vile, scheming, evil bitch".</span> Cersei's main reason for antagonizing Margery is because of a prophecy that says she will be brought down by a younger and more beautiful queen. The reader is well aware that this could just as easily be Daenerys, whom Cersei has never even considered.
</li><li> Viserys Targaryen is one for Robert Baratheon: Viserys sees himself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> to Robert's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, but Robert (correctly) sees Viserys' sister Daenerys as more dangerous (though for the wrong reasons). Despite this, Robert still considers him a threat, but would likely reconsider this if he knew just how staggeringly incompetent and useless Viserys really is, making this a strange example of Viserys being a Partly-known Rival who <em>deserves</em> to be treated as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a>, and probably <em>would</em> be treated as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a> if Robert actually knew anything about him. Viserys is also convinced he's been staying just ahead of Robert's assassins for his whole life, but Robert had never actually tried to have him killed since he got to Essos.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFountainhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFountainhead">The Fountainhead</a></em>, Toohey considers himself Howard Roark's arch-rival. When he confronts Roark and asks him, "Why don't you tell me plainly what you think about me?", Roark replies, "I don't think about you."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>: In the Book of Job, Satan works to undermine Job's faith by ruining his life, intending to prove to God that Job's piety is superficial. Job variously lays blame for his misfortune on bad luck, unkind fate, or his own mistakes, and resists the temptation to blame God, but he never even <em>suspects</em> that Satan might be engineering his misfortune.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MarlaMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MarlaMason">Marla Mason</a></em> series, the chaos witch Nicolette is obsessed with becoming Marla's nemesis, while Marla considers her nothing more than a minor nuisance. In the novel <em>Lady of Misrule</em>, several characters outright tell Marla that her refusal to take Nicolette seriously has motivated her to become a far greater threat than she might otherwise have been, as she is trying to become so dangerous that Marla won't be able to ignore her anymore.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix">Gotrek &amp; Felix</a></em> series, the Skaven wizard Thanquol spends decades plotting how to defeat the titular duo after they hunted him for so long and destroyed all his plans. When he finally catches them he finds out that they have no idea who he is, or that the various Skaven attacks they had blundered into over the years were even connected.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Saruman has always envied Gandalf for being the more popular of the two (which was in no small part thanks to him being humbler and wiser). Gandalf on the other hand always respected Saruman and apparently had no idea how much his fellow Maia resented him, being sincere and personable right up to the moment Saruman revealed his true colours and attacked him.

</li><li> Wendy Mass' short story "The Stars at the Finish Line" averts this - the protagonist's academic rivalry with a girl he has a crush on has nabbed him excellent grades. When he mentions this to her close to the end of the story, she acts confused...then laughs and reveals that of course the rivalry was mutual; she was just messing with his head.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDinosaurLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDinosaurLords">The Dinosaur Lords</a></em>, Falk considers Jaume to be his rival and contantly attempts to one-up him, undermine him and, above all, prove that he's worse than Falk. Jaume, on the other hand, has no idea of this and considers Falk to be little more than his co-worker, though one who ascended through ranks admirably fast.

<ul><li> In the first season, Oliver was unaware Malcom Merlyn was behind many of the actions of the year and was also the murderous Dark Archer. Even when Ollie suspected Malcom, he thought the Archer was just Malcom's enforcer, which nearly got him killed when he confronted Merlyn on his own.
</li><li> For his part, Malcom didn't know until the finale that his son's best friend was the vigilante fighting him all year.
</li><li> In the second season, Ollie doesn't know until mid-way through the year that his various challenges are from former ally turned enemy Slade Wilson.
</li><li> Oliver believed Isabel Rochev was a partner and shrewd businesswoman. It's only after Isabel takes over his company that Oliver finds out she's working with Slade, out for revenge after Oliver's father broke off their affair.
</li><li> Finally, Oliver considers Sebastian Blood a good ally, not knowing he's the murderous Brother Blood, another agent of Slade's. Laurel figured it out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">but no one believed her</a> and Blood eventually discredited her so thoroughly that even she was left doubting herself.

</li><li> And then there was Harmony who no-one took seriously at first. She eventually got the gang's attention... well for a moment, but once Buffy saved Dawn, Buffy completely forgot about her. Harmony continued to think Buffy was after her though, even asking Spike to harbor her. Harmony even hid in a coffin when Buffy came to Spike's crypt once thinking that Buffy had found her and was going to kill her. Buffy was actually there to question Spike as usual and had no idea Harmony was even still around.

<ul><li> Ramsay Snow/Bolton was this initially with Jon Snow. Before becoming Warden of the North, Ramsay was rather interested in Jon Snow, who didn't even know much about Ramsay beyond being a Bolton bastard son. Ramsay mentions Jon Snow to his father, citing that despite his bastardry, Jon is still a Stark and is a threat to their rule. Later, he tells Sansa (whose eyes light up upon hearing this) that her half-brother Jon Snow has become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, citing this as proof that bastard children can rise high in the world. Locke, the man he sent to assassinate Jon, gets it even worse; he's killed off by a third party before Jon realizes he isn't a friend, and leaves so little impression everyone immediately forgets he existed.
</li><li> Joffrey absolutely despised Robb Stark. While Robb in return wants to kill Joffrey he considers Tywin to be his true threat. Fitting form, Joffrey considers Robb Stark's death his greatest victory even though he didn't play any role in it.
</li><li> Viserys Targaryen to Robert Baratheon. When Robert hears that Daenerys is pregnant, he goes berserk and calls for her assassination, but when giving the order he throws out "and that fool Viserys", almost as an afterthought.

<ul><li> An interesting example is Nimueh. Though she is a formidable opponent, most of her evil plans are done from a distance, and Prince Arthur never discovers who she truly is after she pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyDamsel">Decoy Damsel</a> on him. She interacts only once with King Uther (who would be her major foe) but then dies in the season finale without any sort of confrontation with either Uther or Arthur. In fact, it's unclear whether they even know that she's dead.
</li><li> It happens again with Morgana. As of the end of series 4, Arthur has no idea that Morgana <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed Uther, resurrected Lancelot, enchanted Guinevere to cheat on Arthur, or brainwashed Merlin into trying to kill Arthur.</span>

At this stage Guinevere is in exile, and although Mithian eventually tumbles to the idea that Arthur isn't interested because of another woman (asking "who is it that trumps a princess?" and "what great family does she come from?"), Guinevere never learns of Mithian's existence at all. Mithian does return in season 5, but it's unclear in Gwen knows that Mithian was Arthur's former fiancee or if she just thinks of Mithian as a political ally that Arthur feels duty-bound to help.

Tasha, the former KBG agent, talks of how she's fought with this woman several times and they have an intense rivalry going. The killer is defeated thanks to Val (who's only posing as a bodyguard when she's really a goofy Valley Girl) and Tasha informs the killer she's beaten. To her shock, the killer says she's never met Tasha before but "you have beaten me once more, Valerie Irons." Apparently, the woman's pride and ego leads her to believe a "world-class bodyguard" like Valerie <em>must</em> be someone she tangled with before.

While he doesn't exactly consider her a 'rival', he is rather shocked to find she doesn't even recognize him. This is eventually subverted when she reveals that whoever pointed out the salutatorian to her accidentally pointed to a random Andorian Julian had been talking to at the time; in other words, she did respect Bashir but just didn't realize he was human!

It turns out to be Alice Sands, a former classmate of Jane's from the police academy who had long been used to coming in first thanks to her demanding father but ended up always behind Jane in training. When Jane graduated top of the class, the woman's father basically disowned her and her life went downhill, all of which she's blamed on Jane, who's amazed as she never even knew the woman in the academy and didn't know they were "competing."
<ul><li> When Alice is arrested, she launches into a major speech on how she was always in Jane's shadow and grew to hate the woman. Jane flatly tells her "You know what I remember about you from the academy? <em>Nothing.</em>" Despite that, Alice still seems to consider her and Jane as major enemies.

<ul><li> Perhaps the most well-known wrestling example: Starting in the mid-nineties, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneDouglas">Shane Douglas</a> has spent over a decade running down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>. Flair barely paid him any attention. This didn't stop even after Douglas finally got a program with Flair in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> in 2000 (and beat Flair twice).
</li><li> During the last year of WCW, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a> was clearly being modeled as a copy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> with promos, popularity and a finisher ("The Bookend") that was a copy of the Rock Bottom. When Booker joined WWF in 2001, he interrupted the Rock in the ring to run the Rock down and say he was the better man. The Rock's reply: "Who...in the blue hell...are you?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>, as part of its campaign to compete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, markets itself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> alternative to WWE, being more violent and bloodier, even going so far as to make occasional not-so-veiled quips at their "competition". WWE responds by...going about their business as usual, not paying any mind to them.
<ul><li> Then there was that ridiculous and pointless storyline where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoadDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoadDogg">BG James</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyGunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyGunn">Kip James</a> as the "Voodoo Kin Mafia" would spend weeks mocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>. They would often challenge the three to a fight with $1 million on the line, wait a few minutes, then denounce them as cowards for not showing up. The three <em>never</em> gave any indication they were aware of this, and when Michaels <em>did</em> make a reference to someone "jerking a curtain", even the fans mistook it as a jab at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a></em> rather than the James gang.
</li><li> According to some backstage reports, this wasn't simply a "dig at the WWE" angle - this was a genuine attempt by TNA to do a crossover with WWE, the $1 million prize money was apparently real (at a time when many of their top draws worked second jobs to pay the bills). They actually sent a message to the WWE front office, asking if the head of the largest wrestling promotion in America and two of his biggest stars would appear on their show broadcast from Universal Studios. Apparently, Dixie Carter was legitimately shocked when they ignored her, and kept checking at the TNA office to see if Vince had left her any messages.
</li><li> It's educational to compare WWE's reaction to TNA with their reaction to the formation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a> in 2019. For pretty much their entire history, WWE has basically treated TNA with bemused indifference, just keeping half an eye on them to see if they have anyone leaving who'd be worth signing (most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> in 2016). When AEW started up, WWE went into overdrive in an attempt to drive them out of business by immediately moving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a> from the WWE Network to live TV on Wednesday night to counter-program against <em>AEW Dynamite</em>, going into a frenzy of signing as much new talent as possible while resigning existing talent to much longer contracts in an attempt to keep performers from leaving WWE for AEW, and generally trying to screw with AEW as much as possible e.g trying to keep them from booking large venues such as Madison Square Garden. Mind you, WWE isn't in quite as unassailable a position in the industry in 2019 as they were back in 2002, with a much more dissatisfied employee roster and fanbase, which is possibly just making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> much more paranoid than he once was about competition.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>'s first major feud was as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>. Lesnar injured Cena in a match, leading up to months of Cena putting out videos trash talking Lesnar while he recovered. When he returned, Cena would even adopt a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, the F-U, as a mockery of Lesnar's finisher, the F-5. Lesnar showed absolutely no response to Cena, and when they met again... well, Lesnar beat him again, though Cena actually looked really good in the match, even in defeat, solidifying his status as a rising star.
</li><li> In 2004 H2Wrestling acted as such to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>, running directly against it with fired ROH wrestler Teddy Hart. ROH was in a moment of weakness, having lost its distributor to the RF Video Scandal, but for the same reason didn't pay H2 or Hart any mind and Hart made a brief return to ROH in 2009 after H2 went under.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> was this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> during their first feud in 2009. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> since then, however.
<ul><li> He got this <em>again</em> in 2011, where The Miz was <em>WWE Champion</em> and was supposed to be the main event at Wrestlemania against Cena. Unfortunately for Miz, Cena and the audience were far more concerned with Cena's problems with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a>. It wasn't until Miz ambushed and practically murdered Cena that anybody really remembered that he was actually in the equation at all.
</li></ul></li><li> TNA had its own unknown rival in the form of Pro Wrestling Syndicate, who it actually did acknowledge...after eight years, during a conflict with its much more known rival Global Force Wrestling. Though the Syndicate was very tongue-in-cheek on their own end, nowhere near as persistent or antagonistic as TNA was towards WWE.
</li><li> Within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> itself, the Briscoes Decade feud was setup by BJ Whitmer encouraging Adam Page to call out Jay Briscoe while Briscoe was not around in an attempt to make Jay look bad. Page, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">not really getting the point</a>, went on to confront and challenge Jay on the first show they were both on together after this. Jay accepted, but not before admitting he had no idea who Page was.
</li><li> Brandi Lauren was this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllysinKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllysinKay">Allysin Kay</a> in Shine Wrestling. Lauren did get Kays (divided)attention after using Kay's own(possible stolen) disguise to help LuFisto retain the single's title belt against Kay, but Kay could never quite remember what it was that made Lauren hate her in the first place. What was worse, <em>the fans</em> couldn't remember seeing Brandi Lauren before, so her whole gimmick in Shine became bragging about how she had been a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNamebigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNamebigEgo">star</a>" on bigger shows like EVOLVE and WWE NXT.

<ul><li> The England vs. Germany football rivalry continues to rage harder and harder into the 2010s... or at least it does in England. The Germans could not care less about England and are much more concerned with their actual arch-rivals, the Dutch. One thing about the 1966 match that <em>did</em> rankle with German fans for a long time was England's controversial third goal; as a result of that, when in a 2006 World Cup match a bad refereeing call deprived England of a <em>valid</em> goal, there was much celebration of a 40-year-old injustice being righted.
</li><li> The city of Baltimore lost their longtime football team, the Colts, to the city of Indianapolis in the spring of 1984. The fans of the team have since sported a longtime hatred of the team for abandoning them, as well as the owners of the team (Robert Irsay at first, then his son Jim after Robert passed away). Since Baltimore gained a new NFL team (the Ravens), whenever the Colts have visited, they have been introduced as the "Indianapolis professional football team" (pointedly avoiding the nickname "Colts"), among other indignities. Those in Indianapolis have no particular hatred of the Baltimore Ravens (or the city of Baltimore in general); many Colts fans don't even know there <em>is</em> a rivalry, and the rest simply don't care.
</li><li> Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns claim rivalries with all three teams in their division: With the Pittsburgh Steelers as a traditional rivalry; with the Cincinnati Bengals as an intrastate rival; and the Ravens for taking the original Browns from them. Unfortunately, due to their...ineptness...at fielding a competitive team, those three teams focus more on each other than the Browns.
</li><li> Both fans and players of the Cincinnati Reds and Milwaukee Brewers have a bitter hatred of the St. Louis Cardinals due to the later team's constant success within their division (and for Brewers losing to the Cardinals in their only World Series appearance), but most Cardinal fans did not realize this, as they were more focused on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Chicago Cubs and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry">Friendly Rival</a> Houston Astros. That was until players on the Reds (Brandon Phillips in 2010) and Brewers (Nyjer Morgan and Zack Greinke in 2011) started insulting the Cardinals. The fans became very aware of the rivalry after that.
</li><li> Fans of the San Diego Padres absolutely hate the Dodgers, bitter at how Dodgers fans have a habit of traveling en masse to San Diego for games and often nullifying their home-field advantage, as well as how the Dodgers are simply their closest geographical rivals in general. Unfortunately for them, their hatred can never be reciprocated, as the Dodgers tend to save all their hate for the Giants, their ancient enemy.
</li><li> The Minnesota Twins fandom contend they have had a rivalry with the New York Yankees ever since beating the Yankees in their very first game in 1961. They often push how they go after the Yankees in playoff chases and celebrated how they were World Champions in 1987 and 1991 when the Yankees were mired in the cellar. It's increased as since 2004, the Twins have lost 10 playoff games to the Yankees and consider them prime targets. Ask any Yankees fan and they barely give the Twins a second thought as not even a distraction to the iconic hate between the Yankees and Red Sox.
</li><li> On a similar note, the New York Mets have almost <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">always</a></em> had to live in the shadow of the regular in-city favorite Yankees. As such they consider the Yankees to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">the local tyrants</a> who need to be taken down a peg, and have declared themselves as the Yankees' second-biggest rivals after the Red Sox. Yankees fans, on the other hand, generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">have zero opinion on the Mets</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1s59u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1s59u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1s59u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Outside of when the Mets and Yankees actually face off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">such as the 2000 World Series</a></span> and a minority are <em>also</em> fans of the Mets who would like to see them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou">win the World Series over any team that's not the Yankees.</a>
</li><li> In the NHL the Nashville Predators and the Columbus Blue Jackets both see the Detroit Red Wings as a major rival. The Red Wings on the other hand are focused on the other Original 6 teams (particularly division rivals - Chicago when they were in the Central; Toronto and Boston now in the Atlantic), the Pittsburgh Penguins, and during the 90s and early 2000s the Colorado Avalanche.
<ul><li> The Preds were just getting recognized by the Red Wings as genuine rivals (after Nashville won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdTimesTheCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdTimesTheCharm">their third playoff matchup in 2012</a>, but the Wings have since moved to the Eastern Conference. Nashville has to focus on Chicago now... but the Blackhawks have been in a heated rivalry with the Vancouver Canucks.
</li><li> Blue Jackets fans, being in the heart of Ohio State territory, hate the Red Wings and everything else from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">that state up north</a>". How a Wings fan sees the Jackets? "Oh, you guys have a team? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">How cute.</a>" It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Detroit swept Columbus</a> the one time the Blue Jackets made the playoffs before the 2013 realignment.
</li></ul></li><li> NCAA Division 2 Lone Star Conference. Midwestern State University and Tarleton State University are hated rivals. Like, Red Sox-Yankees hated rivals. Both of them completely ignore West Texas A&amp;M, who simply believe that both schools are their biggest rivals, and focus on each other. This even got taken to new heights in the 2012 LSC Championship semifinals (basketball), where TSU played WTAMU. WTAMU's fans even tried to invade Tarleton's side of the court. What did Tarleton do? Absolutely nothing. Not even attempt to drown them out.
<ul><li> 2012's football season may have changed that. West Texas's student body "declared war" on MSU's student body in the build-up to the football game on the weekend of November 3, due to this game's winner likely winning the conference and the loser likely going to the dreaded Kanza Bowl (highest-ranked non-playoff teams go, but it's on a bad date and the weather is usually terrible). In the six teams played between the two schools' various sports teams that week, the home field advantage has been minimal, and the games have been rather violent where applicable.

</li></ul></li><li> In NCAA Football the Marshall University Thundering Herd plays this to the West Virginia University Mountaineers. Marshall fans consider this an important heated rivalry and the "Friends of Coal" bowl to be a must watch event. WVU fans consider their annual meeting a pointless game against a mediocre, obscure team.
</li><li> The North Carolina State University Wolfpack considers the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to be their rivals. The NC State side of the rivalry is quite heated and intense. UNC, however is too busy with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%93Duke_rivalry">one of the greatest rivalries in the history of college basketball<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to pay much attention to State, and considers NC State to be, at most, an annoying little brother.
<ul><li> Part of this is because the NC State-UNC rivalry <strong>used</strong> to be bigger than the UNC-Duke Rivalry, but as Duke has risen and NC State has fallen, it has faded in UNC's eyes. This just makes NC State fans madder.
</li></ul></li><li> In English Football, there was a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf">survey as to who clubs consider their chief rivals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Less than half of the "rivalries" were two-way. For example, Manchester United and Liverpool have one of the most intense rivalries in sport. But don't tell that to Arsenal, Bolton, or Leeds, which consider Man Utd their archrival, or Everton, which considers Liverpool its arch-rival.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianFootballLeague">Montreal Alouettes</a>, whose traditional rival (Ottawa) was out of commission after folding twice, had a few of these until a third Ottawa team started up in 2014. Their Labour Day Classic game (traditionally a time where the whole league pairs up in rivalry matches) shifted to an East-versus-West game against the BC Lions, a team that has no real rival, but they never treated BC as their new rival. In 2009, an attempt was made to found a team in Quebec City and have them be Montreal's rival because they'd be in the same province, similar to Edmonton-Calgary and Hamilton-Toronto. Montreal basically laughed it off and shut down their attempt, saying any bid to make another team in their province would have to go through them. Now that Ottawa has a team again, however, the fact that it's technically a new franchise hasn't stopped Montreal from igniting the old flames, probably because they're not the original Montreal Alouettes either and actually began as the Baltimore Stallions during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">American expansion experiment</a>.
</li><li> In NCAA Division I ice hockey, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has decided that Clarkson University is their main rival, while Clarkson focuses primarily on its rivalries with St. Lawrence University, its main mutual rival, and Cornell University. Ironically, Clarkson is somewhat an unknown rival to Cornell, which believes its true rival to be Harvard, another Ivy League School, although, unlike RPI students, Clarkson students generally realize that Cornell does not consider them a rival.
</li><li> Michigan State University considers the University of Michigan to be their biggest rival. Unfortunately for them, while Michigan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">does consider it to be a significant rivalry</a>, it plays second fiddle to Michigan's intense rivalry with Ohio State, stemming from the state border dispute over the ownership of the Toledo Strip. In fact, Michigan fans will root for MSU if they are playing Ohio State because they hate them that much.
</li><li> Rex Ryan, head coach of the Buffalo Bills and formerly of the New York Jets, seems to consider Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, constantly calling him out and talking smack. Belichick, on the other hand, hardly seems to even <em>notice</em> Ryan, though being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Belichick</a>, it's as much the way he is with <em>everyone</em>, not truly lack of interest (his preparation for all opposing teams is exhaustively intense and informative) - Ryan is nothing more than the next entry on the schedule to him.
</li><li> In regards to South-American national soccer teams, the "Rivalry of the Pacific Ocean" often comes off as Peru having this towards Chile. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">The otherwise more or less friendly</a> Peruvians tend to rage at Chileans whenever it's time for their national teams to play in Peruvian soil, which often takes Chileans by surprise since they tend to focus <em>far</em> more on their next-door neighbors: Argentina.
</li><li> In what is probably the most extreme example, UConn head football coach Bob Diaco decided to create a conference rivalry game for the team after losing their traditional rival games during the 2013 conference realignment. He chose the University of Central Florida and went on to create the "Civil ConFLiCT" and have a trophy made up. However, UCF has no interest in the rivalry whatsoever, going so far as to <em>leave the trophy at UConn's stadium</em> when they first won the game in 2016. And with UConn leaving the conference shortly after, it seems this rivalry was more of a dead on arrival-ry.

Bartz has lost his memories of his home world, and doesn't remember Gilgamesh, who shows up and demands a duel. The icing on the cake that Gilgamesh doesn't even seem to realize that Bartz has absolutely no idea who Gilgamesh is in this continuity; Gilgamesh misinterprets Bartz's look of confusion at his arrival as his being dumbstruck at seeing him again. Bartz only accepts his challenge because he feels it'd be a fun way to pass the time.

Specifically, if you kill another player 4 times in succession without being killed by them in return, you will be designated their nemesis and have a flashing icon displayed over your head. Only that player will be able to see this icon (and if they kill you, they receive bonus points) and it won't appear over their head when you spot them. And, even though the nemesis in question will be notified that they're dominating that player after the fourth kill, enemy players' names are not shown outside of the kill feed (except when disguised while playing as a Spy), often leaving the only way to identify a player you've dominated as being the guy who repeatedly charges you brandishing a melee weapon.

Tarquin does later frame Ian for assassination, but it's over a petty argument and to "test" Haley</span>, more or less the opposite of what Ian imagined. Although Tarquin does state he vaguely remembers Ian at one point (but not his name), so he may be partially right.

If Z-100 has noticed, they have yet to show it.
</li><li> This happened briefly in Seattle too in the mid-'00s. A new alternative station popped up with a lineup of DJs that was almost exclusively formerly with the alternative station that had existed in Seattle for around a decade and a half at that point, and their ads and listener testimonials repeatedly made a point of noting how the more popular alternative station sucks now. The more popular station never, ever acknowledged their existence and the upstart alternative station was gone within a year.

Albania would go on to build numerous bunkers around the country out of fear of an invasion that never came. Needless to say, his more successful rivals didn't care much for invading.

This has created a chasm between Battlefield fans and Call of Duty fans where the former claim that their games are a more unique FPS and <em>CoD</em> is generic and doesn't deserve all the sales and popularity it has as a franchise. Call of Duty's response? Its developers were quite surprised to hear that developers and fans of the Battlefield games even care all that much about it and doesn't see why the two franchises can't learn from each other and make the industry as a whole stronger. To non-fans, the two series are often seen as interchangeable.

<ul><li> Nintendo pays the other two little to no mind, Microsoft generally advertises as being the best option without acknowledging the other options, and Sony, interestingly enough, advertises as being the best, but doesn't mention what they're the best <em>at.</em> Except for the Xbox Kinect and Playstation Move being deliberately designed to capitalise on the success of the Wii.
</li><li> An interesting example of this happened with the reveal of the Xbox One and Playstation 4. When fans complained about many of the features of the Xbox One, Microsoft responded with a very "take it or leave it" attitude and basically said that the customer would have to either buy an Xbox One or be stuck in the past. When Sony took advantage of the bad press and based their E3 presentation around unfavorably comparing the One to their PS4 and emphasizing that the PS4 would <em>not</em> have the same controversial features, Microsoft seemed to suddenly realize they have competition and backpedaled on nearly every infamous feature they'd announced.
</li><li> On the topic of consoles, NEC apparently tried to pick a fight with Sega via their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTurbo">Johnny Turbo</a> comics, solely because Sega was the only other console manufacturer at the time who had a CD-ROM accessory out for their console. They even went as far as disputing Sega's claim that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> was the first 16-bit console in the market and claims that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16">TurboGrafx-16</a> was first (which isn't technically correct, as the main CPU of the TG16 was an 8-bit 6502 derivative). Sega most likely didn't care as they did nothing to respond in kind to NEC.
</li></ul></li><li> The Entertainment industry seems to have a bone to pick with the Internet. Justified, as there's much piracy and whatnot going on online. The users of the internet in general couldn't care less... until they tried to force through SOPA, PIPA, and ACTA, that is. And even ACTA wasn't that well-known until the controversy surrounding SOPA and PIPA in the U.S. got people worldwide to take notice.
</li><li> For the longest time, MMORPG rivalries would always take this form with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> being the big guy who had no clue who its rivals were. After <em>WoW</em> established its gameplay and business structure as viable, damn near every MMO to release in its wake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">took deliberate steps to copy it</a>, with inevitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>s in its direction - only to die themselves within a year or two without ever being acknowledged by <em>WoW</em>, since by that point <em>WoW</em> had also generated so much money that the costs to even begin competing on the same level were astronomical, not to mention that the way the genre works would inevitably make <em>WoW</em> the more appealing option (newcomers to the genre would be more interested in the existing and longer-running game that had more content, and those already playing <em>WoW</em> would be heavily invested in and just keep on playing <em>WoW</em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> is so far the only other subscription-based MMO to become a big enough threat to <em>WoW</em>'s dominance to affect when it releases patches, and even then it took <em>XIV</em> almost a decade to get to that point from starting as just another MMO that rushed to beat a <em>WoW</em> expansion to market and nearly killed itself right out of the gate for it.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> there is usually one or two sub reddits that are more or less a hatedom for popular sub reddits. The larger sub reddits rarely notice unless they represent viewpoints that frequently clash in real life (and sometimes not even then).
</li><li> North Korea had been constantly threatening the United States and South Korea with nuclear war early in 2013. Judging by the comments on news stories about these threats, most Americans were unaware why North Korea was suddenly so angry at them and were not at all intimidated. In general, the entire justification for their military government is the "inevitable" American invasion, when America has barely thought about them for over 50 years and, short of North Korea actually crossing the DMZ, has no reason to do so. This specific case appears to have been something the NK leadership made up so that after the posturing they can claim the Americans backed down. More recently, however, this has been subverted given that the DPRK's improving nuclear tech has increased the fear of their threats having the possibility of actually being followed through with among average Americans, and American politicians are competing with each other over who has the best solution in dealing with the North.
</li><li> In the late 19th century, the thought of annexation by the US was a huge issue to Canadians.
<ul><li> Politicians won elections campaigning against it, political cartoons were circulated in Canadian newspapers depicting Canada or Britannia kicking Uncle Sam to the curb, etc. Meanwhile, most Americans weren't focused on Canada, caring much more about the Civil War, the conflicts with the Native Americans, and military interventions in Central America. There were only two times that the United States actually made any attempt toward annexing Canada: once during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>, and once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">before the US technically existed</a>. After that, US expansion was uniformly aimed westward, not northward.
</li><li> The leading Canadian politicians of the era kept the state of affairs firmly in this trope. Their goal was to make sure that the United States did not start looking north as a direction for expansion. The Northwest Mounted Police were established primarily to make sure that Canada could justify its claims over the areas that would become Alberta and Saskatchewan and a transcontinental railroad was built to solidify this claim. However, Canada never tried to claim any territory to the south which was claimed by the United States. This resulted in any Americans who tried to look north to quickly decide that it would be too much of a headache when they could go west instead.
</li><li> This still shows up in the way the War of 1812 is covered in history books in respective countries. From the Canadian perspective, this was the conflict in which Canadian farmers beat back Yankee invaders and burned down the White House in revenge (rather inaccurately, since the forces that raided Washington were British regulars with hardly a Canadian among them), while very few people in United States know much about this war. Those that do saw the British as their primary enemy in the war, and the casus beli as British impressment of American sailors. The British don't even remember ever fighting it; it was a sideshow for their series of wars with Napolean.
</li></ul></li><li> When Hugo Chávez was alive, he fancied himself and the "Revolution" he led in Venezuela as the biggest enemy of the USA, deprecating the "Empire", rejecting American humanitarian help, antagonizing every American functionary he could and insulting whoever was the States' President at the time. Suffice to say, the feeling wasn't mutual (the King of Spain <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%BFPor_qu%C3%A9_no_te_callas%3F">reacted to his antics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> more than any American President did). The thing was perfectly summed up in a <a class="urllink" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zqvj99gVfLQ/SBTq2IGA_dI/AAAAAAAACDI/Kf5JdC0tX2g/s400/DANGER.jpg">political cartoon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> which depicts Chavez as a gas station employee insulting car driver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> while the latter says "Yes, yes, whatever you say... fill up the tank, buddy!" His successor as President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, has continued the pattern.
</li><li> Several political analysts see the traditional anti-American feeling prevalent in South America as a form of this trope. While not denying the controversial policies applied in the region, and the justified hate several citizens of certain countries have against USA, the truth is that more often than not the countries that obsess the most against the USA tend to be the ones who have had the least direct American intervention during their history. Most Americans don't even know about it.
</li><li> When it was discovered that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a> Day" and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> 50th Anniversary were on the same day (November 23rd, 2013), some of the band's fans were quite upset, going so far as to demand that <em>Doctor Who</em> change the date of the Anniversary Special and claim that One Direction had somehow "picked the day first." Doctor Who fans just either laughed at them (if they were being generous), or asked who One Direction was.
</li><li> Since they weren't invited to the treaties that ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, Andorra was technically at war with Germany for 25 years without Germany noticing. Better yet, America was invited but didn't sign, meaning technically, America was still at war with Germany until they later signed a separate peace agreement. Similarly, Teddy Roosevelt forgot to invite representatives from Montenegro to the peace conference to end the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussoJapaneseWar">Russo-Japanese War</a> that he was hosting at Portsmouth because he did not realize that Montenegro declared war against Japan in a show of solidarity with Russia.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> was this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> when he was the US' President. Despite actually calling for his <em>impeachment</em> (which often tries the patience of members of her own party) he rarely even acknowledged a thing she said, brushing off the few questions interviewers asked him about her.
</li><li> There's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boehner">John Boehner's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> attempt to <em>sue the president</em>. Needless to say the president doesn't seem to have even noticed this, let alone actually care (he certainly hasn't felt the need to comment).
</li><li> In the U.S., members of the the Green Party really, really hate the Democratic Party, despite, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">or possibly because of</a>, the Greens being very similar ideologically to the left wing of the Democrats. The Democrats almost never mention the Greens, but many of them did blame Ralph Nader and Jill Stein for their presidential losses in 2000 and 2016. This is probably connected to the party leadership refusing to acknowledge that its own left wing exists unless it's to blame Bernie Sanders or the Occupy movement for something.
</li><li> Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It's common for Baltimoreans to have chips on their shoulders about DC. In DC, by contrast, some people show how PC they are by saying nice things about Baltimore, while most people need to be reminded that Baltimore even exists.
</li><li> The Westboro Baptist Church claims God hates <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">everyone on Earth</a></em>. Unless they directly picket someone, most people just ignore them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a> was this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>. The whole reason why Eric Arthur Blair used the pseudonym George Orwell was because he was deadly afraid that Stalin would try and assassinate him, and his two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">most</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">famous</a> works were based on his views on Stalin and his regime. As far as we know, Stalin didn't even know Orwell <em>existed</em> and was far more preoccupied with the Germans and later the Allies to care about some political author from England.
</li><li> Subverted between Internet host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoahAntwiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoahAntwiler">Noah Antwiler</a> and pro wrestling's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">Dixie Carter</a>. At the time, Antwiler was making a series of videos mocking TNA Wrestling, which <em>did</em> catch Carter's attention. Her Tweets trying to figure out the situation were initially seen as insults <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">due to differences in regional dialects</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4y14i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4y14i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4y14i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Carter asked if Antwiler was being "nasty", a Southern colloquialism for "rude" or "petty"</span>, but once things were cleared up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryJoeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryJoeShow">Angry Joe</a> and others, Antwiler pointed out that the head of an entertainment company really shouldn't be spending much time or energy on what a single Internet critic thinks of them.
