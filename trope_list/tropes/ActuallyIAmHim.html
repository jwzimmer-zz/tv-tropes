During the search, he meets a stranger, and the conversation turns to the sought-after character. The stranger will typically either respond, "Oh, I know him well..." or else act as if he's never heard of the person. Either way, in time it is revealed that this stranger <em>is</em> the sought-after character.
</p><p>Often, the stranger is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">playing dumb</a> about their true identity in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">assess the searcher's character</a> and intentions, the idea being that the searcher's behavior will be more genuine in the presence of someone they perceive to be just an ordinary stranger. This can lead to a painful lesson for the searcher once he learns the truth about the stranger, making this a favorite form of introduction among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Trickster Mentors</a>.

</p><p>Further confusion can arise if the sought-after character is of a different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderMisdirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderMisdirection">gender</a>, race, species, etc. than the searcher was expecting, such as when a sought-after "doctor" turns out to be a woman scientist.

<ul><li> Happens at the end of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel">Light Novel</a>, when a Japanese tourist in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">frame story</a> decides to ask the narrator (whom is assumed to be Maiza) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow">where Firo is now</a>, seeing as he's not present like everyone else is. "Maiza" responds...?
<div class="indent">Isn't he right here?...Oh, That's right, I have yet to introduce myself. Well, normally with business associations, I just leave without having ever said my name...
</div></li><li> In a particularly funny example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em>, Train eventually acquires an impostor, who the gang meets. Sven and Eve want to smack him upside the head, but Train listens to his wild stories with a look of wonder on his face, and eventually agrees to become the impostor's apprentice. When people challenge the impostor, Train steps up to the plate, claiming that the other guys aren't "worthy for [Train's] master to spit on." THEN the imposter notices the XIII tattoo, and the unique gun...
</li><li> This is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>. When Spike and Jet go in search of the hacker known as Radical Edward, they get so many widely-varying stories about who Edward is and what he's supposedly like that Jet sarcastically comments that they're looking for a 3-year-old, 7-foot alien genius that plays basketball. When Ed hacks into their computer and they ask who Radical Edward is, she responds in her perpetual adorable third person way of talking, "But Ed is Ed." In case it wasn't clear: Edward is very much a girl tacking on the "Assumed Wrong Gender" part of this trope.
</li><li> Hilariously inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, where, upon meeting a normal monkey, Goku instantly assumed him to be the legendary King Kai, and spent a while fooling around with him before the real Kai - who himself could easily qualify for this trope under different circumstances, what with how he looks and acts - shows up.
</li><li> A thorn in Edward's side in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, that people are more willing to believe that Alphonse is the famous "Fullmetal Alchemist" and not him. (Al <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">a walking suit of armor</a>...)
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em>. It's not clear when Sophie realizes the strange young wizard is Howl himself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> a variation occurs. Rei appears in the story seeking a certain "Man with the Seven Scars", after being told that the aforementioned subject has kidnapped his sister, Airi. Rei eventually meets Kenshiro, who is known for the seven scars in his chest, and tells him about the man he's seeking. Kenshiro initially says nothing about it, and although he has a penchant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleStrip">ripping out his jacket and shirt before delivering a beatdown to bad guys</a>, Ken strangely refrains from doing this for the entirety of the arc, until Rei learns the truth anyway. Ken and Rei go on to beat the crap out of the Kiba clan, rescuing Airi and eventually becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> in the process, but then Kenshiro decides to confront Rei over the issue with the Man with the Seven Scars, both because Ken is an honest person, and because Rei would someday discover his scars, sooner or later, and should that happen Rei might turn on him, so the issue needs to be resolved. Thus, Ken reveals his scarred chest to Rei; Rei initially is shocked, but then refuses to believe Ken was the man he was looking for as the captor of Airi, on the basis that he knows Ken is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> who helped Rei himself rescue his sister anyways. Some time later, Ken reveals that the true culprit behind Airi's kidnapping was his evil adoptive brother, Jagi, who had scarred his own chest with seven scars in order to frame Kenshiro and tarnish the latter's reputation.

</li><li> Also, Team White Snow's captain isn't Zanak, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's Max</span>, although it's easy to make the mistake since he's the Forward and all the other team captains are Forwards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends">Kemono Friends</a></em>: For much of the series, Racoon is chasing after a hat thief, and along the way she runs into a number of Friends who tell her about their encounters with an incredibly helpful person named Kaban. When she finally catches her prey in Episode 11, her friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder">Fennec</a>, who's been paying more attention to those stories, calmly explains that the "Hat Thief" <em>is</em> Kaban. Racoon initially doesn't believe her, saying that someone as good as Kaban would never steal, but eventually she realizes that she had it wrong from the start and apologizes.
</li><li> In the manga adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>: Ocarina of Time</em>, Link meets young Zelda, who has escaped from the castle and disguised herself as a commoner girl. When Link asks her about Princess Zelda's whereabouts, she tells him that she and Zelda are good friends and that she'd introduce him if he played with her for a whole day.

</div></li><li> The 1962 Paramount cartoon <em>Perry Popgun</em> has the titular detective entering a club in disguise, and everyone recognizes him. Everyone except his girlfriend Goldie, who slaps him when he approaches her.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PiratesOfDarkWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PiratesOfDarkWater">Pirates of Dark Water</a></em>, Ren seeks out the wise man Alomar in the Abby of Galdebar. First he meets an imposing man, who he assumes is Alomar, but he's just a servant. Next he encounters a fearsome dragon, who it turns out is Alomar.
</li><li> An episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PolePosition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PolePosition">Pole Position</a></em> animated series had the characters sent to retrieve a sensitive research satellite for a "Doctor T.

Meanwhile two fellows, both claiming to be "Dr. Ted Russell" and "Dr. Tom Russell" are trying to get the satellite. The protagonists finally find it...and the backwoods-lady reveals that they're <em>both</em> industrial spies. Her full name is Dr. <em>Theodora</em> Russell, and she just happens to live out in the middle of nowhere.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the third-season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Flaming Moe's". Moe's bar, temporarily tremendously popular due to Moe's appropriation of Homer's drink, the "Flaming Homer", possesses a man going by "Hugh Jass", the fake name that Bart chose to prank the bar with. Jass good-naturedly allowed Bart to bail on the failed prank call.

Yularen asks Agent Kallus for his opinion on who the mole might be. Kallus gives a very careful response to that question Â— because, in keeping with this trope, <em>he</em> is the mole.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, Leo's first meeting with The Ancient One is a textbook example of the trope. Fortunately he figures it out on his own.
</li><li> This happens in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>: Robin went to study martial arts under a mysterious teacher called The True Master. To get to The True Master, he must climb a tall mountain before sundown. Along the way, he repeatedly encounters an old woman who requests his help carrying her things up the mountain, which he refuses because he's in a hurry. When he arrives, it turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">she is The True Master</a>, but there's no implication that she concealed her identity on purpose. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">Robin just never thought to ask</a>.

<ul><li> Nestor Makhno, the Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary, caught a group of German officers going to a party held in their honour by Ukrainian landlords, who had welcomed the invading Germans. After executing the officers, Makhno and his men dressed in the German army uniforms and attended the party in their stead. Much of the conversation at the dinner party circled around Makhno. At the end of the meal, a toast was offered to the capture of the dreaded anarchist Nestor Makhno. Makhno drank off the toast and announced, "I am Nestor Makhno." In the silence and horror which followed, Makhno tossed a bomb into the room as he and his men leaped out the windows and escaped.

<ul><li> In 2000, presidential candidate George W. Bush appointed Dick Cheney as the head of his running mate search committee before choosing Cheney for the job.
</li><li> The conclave of Cardinals following the death or abdication of a Pope is presided over by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. In 2005, after the death of Pope John Paul II, the Dean was Joseph Ratzinger, whom the conclave elected Pope Benedict XVI. He was considered, as it were, the frontrunner even before John Paul II was dead.
</li></ul></li><li> Disgruntled customers on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight">Not Always Right</a> often demand to see the manager or owner, only to be told that they're already speaking to him/her.

</li><li> There's an Italian joke subverting this trope: Jesus walks along the street when he sees a sad old man sitting on a bench. He stops and asks him what his name is and why he is sad. He says his name is Joseph and he has lost his son. "How will you recognise your son?" "He has nails in his hands and feet." "Father!" "Pinocchio!" (Geppetto is a diminutive for Giuseppe, the Italian form of Joseph.)
</li><li> At one point right after confederation, Sir John A Macdonald (the first Prime Minister of Canada) was at a diplomatic reception in Washington, D.C., where he struck up a conversation with an American senator's wife. When he revealed he was from Canada, she began asking about his Prime Minister, stating she had heard stories that he was a drunk and a rogue. Sir John A agreed with her on both points, at which point the senator himself wandered over and fully introduced him.

While he was secretly scouting out land for a second theme park on the US east coast in the mid 1960s, he'd travel under fake names. Eventually he was recognized (since he did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">host a TV show</a> at the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">it was crazy that it hadn't happened before</a>) by a reporter who asked if he was the real Walt Disney. Walt replied with "No, but I get confused for that bastard all the time. Trust me, when I find that son of a bitch I'm <em>really</em> going to let him have it." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Since of course the "real" Walt Disney would never swear or threaten physical harm on anyone, the reporter decided it wasn't him and walked away.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> once attended a picket line of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em> as a picketer.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>
<ul><li> Painter Gilbert Stuart had a moment with George Washington. Stuart had been invited to a presidential levee and, assuming it was run along the same lines as similar events in Europe, presumed the room full of milling, chatting gentlemen was a sort of waiting room and he would in due course be ushered into the presence. Eventually President Washington noticed an unfamiliar guest wandering around talking to no one and, like a good host, went over and introduced himself. Stuart, it is said, never entirely recovered from this experience.
</li><li> A man was riding along when he saw an officer who was ordering soldiers to lift timber but not doing anything to help them. The rider asked him why he was just standing there; the officer sneered, "Why sir, I'm a corporal!" Upon hearing this, the stranger promptly dismounted and spent several minutes helping the men move the timber. As he was about to ride off, he turned to the pompous corporal and quietly said, "The next time you have a piece of timber for your men to handle, corporal, send for your commander-in-chief."
</li></ul></li><li> There is a story concerning Peisistratus, a politician from Ancient Athens, who was walking through the Athenian countryside and got chatting with a farmer. Not realising who he was talking to, the farmer spent most of the conversation criticising Peisistratus' policies, calling him a tyrant and complaining about unfair taxes. Peisistratus listened patiently, then asked "What do you get from the land you farm?" The farmer replied: "Nothing but aches and pains. If only Peisistratus and his tax collectors would take their fair share of those." Peisistratus, having a good sense of humour, decreed that the farmer need never pay taxes again.
</li><li> British artist Sir Stanley Spencer was invited to receive an award at a ceremony in London. While getting off the train at Euston station, a gentleman mistook him for a porter and asked for help carrying his bags. Stanley obliged and helped the man carry his bags across London. When he arrived at the ceremony that evening, the award was handed to him by the gentleman he'd helped earlier that day.
</li><li> There is an almost certainly apocryphal story of various great leaders such as Napoleon or Peter the Great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">going out into his army disguised as a common soldier</a>. He met a savvy veteran who shared that he had gotten short on money and taken his sword to a pawn shop, with the plans to redeem it as soon as he got paid. Until then, he had only the hilt of a sword attached to a stick that went into his scabbard. Later that day, Napoleon returned undisguised to hold a surprise inspection. He found a soldier who did not pass, then turned to the veteran and ordered him to cut down his comrade. The veteran, knowing he faced punishment if anyone knew he had pawned his sword, cried out "May God turn my sword to wood so that I need not do this thing!" He then drew his sword hilt which had a wooden blade. The next day, he received a beautiful new sword and a note saying "This one will get you more at the pawn shop," signed Napoleon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a> said once that she'd go out to a restaurant, and be told "You look <em>just like</em> the girl who plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Hermione Granger</a>!", to which Emma would laugh and inform them that, well, that's because she <em>is</em> "that girl".
</li><li> Following treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, Australian songstress Delta Goodrem's hair grew back shorter, curlier and darker. A stranger is alleged to have told her "You look a lot like Delta Goodrem, only prettier."
</li><li> Inverted by J. Golden Kimball, a prominent Mormon in the early 20th century. Once he was drinking coffee in a restaurant and someone recognized him, prompting the following exchange.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lady:</strong> Aren't you Brother Kimball? And isn't that coffee you're drinking? <br/><strong>Kimball:</strong> Ma'am, you're the third person today who's mistaken me for that old SOB.

The clerk asked if her husband didn't perhaps have a bit of a crush on Trinity, to which Moss replied, "I hope so!"

You look like the woman on the show," to which she replied "Is it good?" and he said "I like it".
</li><li> In another joke, an officer moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey">a Pentagon job</a> finds himself overloaded with bureaucratic red tape. Worse, he notices that a young lieutenant in the next office is finishing far more paperwork in far less time. Swallowing his pride, he asks the lieutenant his secret, which turns out to be "Just stamp everything 'Route to Major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrSmith">John Smith</a>' Â— somebody around here is bound to have that name and rank". One guess who that turned out to be....
</li><li> The Secret Service was protecting President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> during a trip to Canada. A particularly keen agent stopped a middle-aged man who was about to walk into the house at Harrington Lake where the President was staying. "Who are you and where are you going?" "I live here, and I'm going to the bathroom," said Lester B. Pearson, Prime Minister of Canada.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman">Feynman's</a> second day at Cornell, he went to the housing office to look for a place to stay. They told him "Listen, Buddy, the room situation is tough. In fact, it's so tough that believe it or not, a professor had to sleep in the lobby here last night." He replied, "I am that professor and I'm not keen on doing it again."
</li><li> Queen Elizabeth II once stopped in a roadside shop incognito during a road trip. As she was paying, the clerk said, "You know, you look awfully like the Queen." Her Majesty replied, "How very reassuring."
</li><li> An Athenian named Aristides, nicknamed "the Just" is said to have once been approached by a man who didn't recognize him who wanted help writing the name Aristides on an ostrakon (a piece of broken pottery that Athenians used as scrap paper) as his vote for who to ostracise<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note262k9');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note262k9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note262k9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">i.e. exile from Athens for ten years</span>. When asked why he wanted Aristides ostracised, the stranger replied that he'd never met him, but was sick of hearing him called "the Just". Being an honest man, Aristides wrotes his own name on the ostrakon, and ended up ostracised, though presumably by more than one vote.
</li><li> After the 2017 Barcelona van attack, a woman attracted by the commotion asked what had happened to a man leaving the area. The man shrugged and said he didn't know. He was Younes Abouyaaqoub, the perpetrator of the attack.

And even with her <em>Game of Thrones</em> castmates, no one would know it was her.
</li><li> Shortly after Michael Jackson's "Beat It" came out, Eddie Van Halen (who plays the guitar solo on the track) was at a record store when the song came on. He overheard a teenager saying to his friends, "Listen to this guy, trying to sound like Eddie Van Halen!" He then tapped the poor kid on the shoulder and said, "Actually, that IS me." No word on how the skeptical lad reacted.
