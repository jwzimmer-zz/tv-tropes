Due to their frequent role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">narrators</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfView">Point of View</a> characters, a protagonist's perspective tends to make an impression on the work more than any other character's—their thoughts will overlap with narration, their feelings will shape the setting, and their priorities will dictate the plot. The way events are treated will be colored by how they relate to the protagonist, the things they love, the people they care about. It's hard to imagine a story told otherwise, but then sometimes this point of view seems to spread like an inkblot and color the way <em>everything</em> behaves and thinks. The work lapses into Protagonist-Centered Morality — a state where, on some profound cosmic level, the very fabric of the fictional universe seems to be seeing things from the protagonist's point of view. Every single sympathetic character, the symbolism, the narration, judge characters as worthy of praise, condemnation or indifference depending on how much favor they carry with the "good guys". The protagonists themselves can seemingly do no wrong, and even if there's anyone at all who would beg to differ, they're obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">a bad guy</a>.

There will be no warning signs that the protagonist is being unfair to the hero who saved all these people. No one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls them out</a> on how disrespectful they're being to the memory of thousands of the mass-murderer's victims. This will not come back to haunt them.

Conversely, by exaggerating the trope, they may tempt viewers to disavow seemingly morally-bankrupt decisions of the protagonist, then allow plot developments to suggest that they acted wisely. Viewers who discover these nuances can learn many important things about the integrity of their own moral compass, and thus benefit.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Koga's wolf pack ate Rin's entire village (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">despite them beating up Rin</a>) and gleefully killed her when she tried escaping. But after kidnapping Kagome and a little mini arc, suddenly he's been turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> and no worse. When Koga kidnapped Kagome he was more than willing to let his pack eat Shippo, who is the demon equivalent of a seven-year-old, until Kagome refused to help him if they did. Worse, his motivation for pursuing Naraku is that one of Naraku's demons slaughtered his entire pack; you know, kind of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">exact same thing he did to poor little Rin and her innocent village</a></em>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turned into</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> much later in the series, though he still maintained the jerkass act.
</li><li> The entire narrative seems to very solidly take Kagome's side in the entire love triangle with herself, Inuyasha, and Kikyo, even in ways that don't really make any sense. One recurring theme is that other characters don't seem to want Inuyasha to fix his badly broken relationship with Kikyo in any way whatsoever, as he will be reprimanded for "cheating" on Kagome and hurting her feelings for speaking to or about her or what happened between them, despite the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> turning them against each other and having Inuyasha sealed to a tree for 50 years would logically be the kind of thing you would understand trying to sort out to some extent. This attitude toward Inuyasha and Kikyo's relationship is present <em>long</em> before he and Kagome officially get together at the very end of the story and even before their relationship is anything remotely serious. In addition to this, while Inuyasha was sealed to the tree he was asleep the whole time. To him it seemed like Kikyo turned on him the day before he met Kagome. Kagome herself notices this early on. That said, early on in the story, Kikyo tried to kill him so they could be together in the afterlife since she already died and was brought back in an unstable temporary body.
</li><li> To say nothing of the fact that Kagome frequently beats Inuyasha via the rosary around his neck whenever he annoys her in the slightest. While played for comedy, he is shown to both actively fear being "sat" and screams in pain whenever it happens. No one ever says a word in his defense over a protective measure being so abused like it is. As a matter of fact, his so called "friends" often chide him, either openly or to themselves, about how stupid he is for causing the beating in the first place. Forget being a beaten spouse, Inuyasha is more like an enslaved dog who is forced to act as muscle for a group that only values him when he acts in the manner in which they approve. A particularly horrifying example happens early on. To wit, Inuyasha was badly wounded in a battle with a Nigh-Immortal Yura of the hair. As he recuperates up in a tree all by himself, Kagome appears with a first aid kit. Now, despite knowing next to nothing about medical care at this point, Kagome demands that he come down so that she can care for him. When Inuyasha chooses to grumpily demand to be left alone, Kagome sits him. This yanks him out of the tree, and sends him plummeting ten, fifteen feet, before smashing him face first into the ground hard enough to leave an imprint. Think on this. Kagome slams a person who she believes to be seriously wounded into the earth with the force of a giant. Then she has the utter gall to LECTURE Inuyasha about how stupid and stubborn he is. To make matters worse, she is never, EVER called out on this.
</li><li> In Kikyo second appearance Inuyasha and Co. are trying to figure out who or what is stealing the souls of dying women and stop them. Once they find out it's Kikyo stealing the souls to keep herself alive though, the group and the story immediately stop caring and shift to focusing on the drama of the love triangle. Kikyo spends the rest of the series stealing and eating souls regularly and it doesn't raise a peep from anyone after this point.

It was unprovoked and a horrible thing to do, and Gajeel was still a psycho then, but no one got hurt. Yet, Natsu and everyone else demand retribution, and then seek it out when someone is actually attacked. Okay, fine, but fast forward to the Grand Magic Games arc. Natsu hears the sad kicked-out-of-guild story of Yukino, who he's known for all of one day, and decides to <em>break into their guild quarters and start beating the crap out of people unprovoked</em>. He is actively not only causing property damage, but assaulting people who did nothing to him. Mind, this isn't even their guild hall—it's a hotel they're staying in for the Games, and they'll have to pay for the damages. At worst, people say that Natsu acted rashly but his heart was in the right place and at best, people defend him.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After First Master Mavis Vermilion, explains how she got her curse, a curse that kills everything around her, and feels guilty for what happened because of it, the protagonists tell her not to feel guilty. And yet, no one has ever shown any kind of sympathy for Zeref who has suffered the exact same curse for <em>400 years</em>. For centuries he has been known as the darkest and most evil magician in history, even though most of the deaths he caused were due to his curse. It is very possible that Mavis would too be considered as evil if she were to live as long as him (and it should be noted compared to Zeref, she's only seen killing <em>one</em> person completely by accident when her curse first awakens). The masters of Fairy Tail are aware of this so they maintain this story a secret.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The only one that seems to feel sympathy for him is Mavis herself, since she experienced the same curse, even if in a considerably shorter time, though she opposes the man she once loved after he declares his intention to wipe out humanity.</span>

Before his climactic fight with Kallen, he mentions that acts which might normally brand one as a mass murderer will instead be treated as those of a hero if they are done for the sake of one's country. When Kallen presses that Luciano wants to be a hero, he flat out says that he simply enjoys killing, and the good reputation is just a bonus.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. The protagonists are pirates, so they don't care if someone does bad things unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a>. If someone makes their friend cry, he's a bad guy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Arlong</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Crocodile</a> etc.) but if a bad guy helps them (Buggy) they are grateful and no one mentions their evil deeds. On the other hand, they do understand that the marines are the good guys as often as the other way around, but they get hostile treatment because of their opposing standpoints. Essentially, Luffy and the Strawhats do not consider themselves heroes, they don't do things for the greater good. Luffy only cares about his friends, it just so happens that most of the time when he's helping a friend or one of his crew members, he's doing the greater good. And Luffy makes friends quite easily, so odds are very good that any villain he encounters will be a threat to one of Luffy's friends.
<ul><li> Humorously lampshaded when Luffy tells a civilian friend of theirs that he can't trust <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Aokiji</a> because Aokiji is a Marine. After getting a confused look in response he remembers that Marines are the good guys (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">in theory, at least</a>).
</li><li> Surprisingly subverted with Crocodile. Luffy flat-out initially rejects breaking Crocodile out of prison, showing even he has his limits. He only does so because one of Luffy's new friends points out that they need his strength (and is able to <em>blackmail</em> Crocodile into compliance with a secret not yet known.)
</li></ul></li><li> At the start of the second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em>, Umi comments on how the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">the end of the first half</a> have left her unable to enjoy playing RPGs anymore.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In order to gain his Blue-Eyes White Dragon cards, Seto Kaiba used his wealth and connections to force one of the original owners into bankruptcy and another to commit suicide. He then kidnapped Yugi's grandfather Sugoroku, humiliated him in their duel, and destroyed Sugoroku's Blue-Eyes White Dragon card out of pure spite before forcing Yugi's grandfather to suffer a simulation of the Penalty Game Yami Yugi had forced on him. He then forced Yugi and his friends to play his Death-T games which Kaiba had designed specifically to kill Yugi, employing professional hitmen, a torturer, and even a serial child murderer in the various stages to do so. When his younger brother Mokuba, perhaps the only person who actually loved Kaiba, failed to defeat Yugi, Kaiba subjugated him to the same holographic penalty game he had inflicted on Sugoroku. After rebuilding his heart, Kaiba still treats Yugi and his friends with disdain and explicitly uses hatred to try and defeat Yugi, but at most is considered a jerk who doesn't understand what the others have been through—but his own abusive childhood, which colored his actions, is overlooked by everyone but Yugi and Mokuba.
</li><li> And then there's Mokuba, who after Kaiba's initial defeat following his attempt to steal Sugoroku's Blue-Eyes White Dragon, had no compunctions about using violence and trickery to force Yugi into playing rigged games that had the threat of death should Yugi lose. As with Kaiba, Mokuba's actions are later excused by the other characters simply because of an abusive childhood and love for his big brother. He is more easily excused as he is portrayed as younger than the other characters.
</li><li> On a more general level, antagonists who use manipulative mind-games are called dishonorable, ones who keep secrets are called liars, ones that go on the defensive are called cowards exposing their own weakness, and ones that use cheap tactics are called cheaters. When main characters do these things they're simply said to be using intelligent strategy.
</li></ul></li><li> Nobody ever considers the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> to be evil in their own reality (and their constant claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"It's not our fault!"</a> is readily believed) despite the fact that they've committed <em>planet-wide genocide</em> multiple times. (A combination of this Trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Crosses the Line Twice</a> is needed here.)
</li><li> Mostly averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series; after defeating the villainous threat, the heroes don't just use the titular orbs to bring back the friends lost during the fight with said villain... they bring back <em>everyone</em> the villain killed. This was first shown following the King Piccolo Arc, where originally the heroes asked Shenron to just bring back their friends<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0x271');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0x271" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0x271');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Krillin, Master Roshi, and Chiaotzu</span>, but Yamacha insisted that <em>all</em> of King Piccolo's victims be revived.
<ul><li> There is the habit of turning former foes into allies and even friends. While you can argue Piccolo is not the same person as King Piccolo, even though he has all his memories, Vegeta is clearly responsible for billions of deaths on many worlds, for which he took great pleasure in.

Everyone, including Yuuji himself, comes to her defense and gets pissed off at them for how horrible it was for them to say something like that to her (and he decides to beat them up for it as well). The problem is, Shouko daily inflicts violence on Yuuji that stretches well beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male</a> territory into the downright <em>criminal</em>. Apparently, being a torturous, psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> is okay if you're one of the protagonists, but verbally knocking her down a peg is not.
</li><li> Kyoji Nemoto getting his hands on Mizuki's love letter and using it to blackmail her in order to get her out of the class battle makes him a cheating scumbag, and the protagonists continue to believe he only did it because he had something personal against her or was a misogynist, even though he makes it clear it had nothing to do with either of those things and was just trying to get her out of the way so his class could win, considering she's basically the only reason why Class F keeps winning so much. The story agrees with them; not only is Nemoto soundly defeated, he's subjected to various humiliations for it which quickly become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">disproportionate</a>. When Miharu uses a compromising photo to blackmail the two main boys, which gets them ostracized and beat up by the entire female enrollment of the school, nothing bad happens to her, even when she's found out, and her own misandry is never brought up, even though Nemoto is called a misogynist just because the target of his blackmail happened to be a girl.
</li><li> The Tokonatsu duo had a very legitimate gripe with Aki and Yuuji; when they ate at class F's cafe during the school festival, Yuuji was completely rude to them, served them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Mizuki's cooking</a> despite knowing full well that it wasn't safe for human consumption, and <em>beat them up</em> when they complained. When they attempt to get one back on the boys for ruining something <em>they paid for</em>, everyone views them as assholes, although at worst they're just being petty, which is no worse than Yuuji seemingly going out of his way just to pick a fight with them.

Keep in mind that attempted assassination of what is basically the leader of a nation is an extremely serious crime no matter where in the world you are, but she gets let off the hook by <em>Seitenshi herself</em> because Rentaro and Enju had befriended her the day before.

Danzo has committed a string of morally questionable actions for (what he views as) the good of the village, but what puts the protagonists at odds with him was giving the Cloud village permission to kill Sasuke, who had recently assisted the same terrorist organization that had antagonized the village throughout Part II (and had just reduced it to a crater) by capturing a jinchuuriki like Naruto without any regard for the man's life.

<ul><li> In <em>The Red Sea Sharks</em> he supports Emir Ben Kalish Ezab over Bab El Ehr despite that Ben Kalish Ezab apparently tortures people, thinks trials are a waste of time, and was fine with slave trading until Arabair refused his son's stupid request. This could be seen as holding more water than claiming that General Alcazar is "Tintin's pet dictator".
</li><li> The first time he got involved with Alcazar it was accidentally in the course of an investigation of a museum robbery in <em>The Broken Ear</em>. Here Tintin shouted "long live Alcazar!" while drunk, and afterwards was treated as a friend by Alcazar. In <em>Tintin and the Picaros</em> Tintin only became involved in the civil war in San Theodoros because he wanted to save his friends Bianca Castafiore, Thompson and Thomson (wrongfully arrested as part of a plot against Tintin masterminded by Colonel Sponsz). And when he helped Alcazar to win he did it to ensure that the coup would be bloodless.
</li><li> The problem is perhaps that with Hergé's somewhat disillusioned world-view, plus the fact that he and Tintin come from a small country like Belgium, it would simply not be a realistic option for Tintin to oust both sides from power and impose a third option with no visible popular support in Khemed or San Theodoros.

<ul><li> This hit its peak when, during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BattleOfTheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BattleOfTheAtom">Battle of the Atom</a></em> crossover, Wolverine calls out Cyke for killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX">Charles Xavier</a>. Never mind that Cyke was possessed by a cosmic force and killed Xavier in self defense  <em>Wolverine kills all the time!</em> Cyclops calls him out on the hypocrisy, pointing out that Cyclops has killed one person, while Wolverine has killed <em>many</em>. How does Wolverine respond? "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">You killed the only one that matters</a>." That is a direct quote. Note that at the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Northstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Northstar">Northstar</a> was on his team, a character who, a few years ago, Wolverine had killed while brainwashed, essentially the same circumstances that Cyclops was under when he killed Xavier. No one points this out, not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Northstar himself</a>.
</li><li> A better rationalisation for this was presented in one of the <em>A+X</em> team-up books that followed <em>Avengers vs X-Men</em>, when Cyclops and Wolverine were reluctantly forced to work together. Afterwards, Wolverine explained his main problem was not so much what Cyclops did (though he definitely had a problem with that), but that he felt Cyclops was refusing to take responsibility for it - which at least makes some degree of sense.
</li></ul></li><li> The way the X-Men respond to anyone who attempts to cure mutants smacks heavily of this trope. The X-Men, by and large, are all incredibly good looking (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics">Beast</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> - though he's still generally drawn as a male version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a>) and have powers that are mostly cool and easy to control (Cyclops and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> being the two obvious exceptions). Anyone who ever tries to find a way to cure mutants is 100% always a villain who needs to be stopped. There really isn't every any consideration of all the mutants who got the shit-end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> and ended up with something like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gasshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gasshole">perpetual flatulence</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">being really ugly</a> and therefore <em>would</em> benefit from a way to live a normal human life. Unfortunately, though, this is justified by the fact that in the Marvel Universe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>, and any such cure really would be weaponised. Immediately.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wanted">Wanted</a></em> deconstructs this in a rather interesting way. The protagonist Wesley Gibson starts out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">an almost comically gutless, whiny loser</a> before he is introduced into the world of supervillains. As part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a> act, he instead becomes a sadistic, depraved mass-murdering monster through an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney">The Hero's Journey</a>-type of story arc, while the reader is forced to side with him due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> perspective and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a> morality. In reality Wesley's enemies are barely worse than him, and the comic ends with Wesley becoming one of the five supervillain overlords of the planet, his journey to power, wealth and evil completed. Any readers who at this point were still rooting for the guy as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> badass despite his depravities are soon reminded how bad he is when he turns to the reader, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">calls them out on supporting him</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">then rapes you</a>. Don't forget, <em>he's the villain</em>.
</li><li> The way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> treats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> in comparison to how he deals with every other thief in Gotham. While a lot of people think of Catwoman as primarily being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, the fact is that there are many stories where Catwoman is out for herself. But even when she's not helping him, Batman usually doesn't seem too concerned with catching her. And the people Catwoman steals from? Well, apparently they don't matter. We're meant to feel that he does it because he sees the potential for good in her—but it's impossible to not feel that he wouldn't be so lenient with her if he didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">have the hots for her</a>. He does have his limits, though. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em>, he captures Catwoman and turns her over to the police after she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills 237 members of a terrorist cell that had bombed the orphanage she grew up in. He's clearly not happy about it, but says she left him no choice this time</span>. However, it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Catwoman, as in Selina Kyle, actually took the blame for her protege, Holly, who killed all the members of said terrorist cell. This is revealed when Bruce and Selina track her down; she has been hiding with Talia</span>.
</li><li> Catwoman's Marvel counterpart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a> also receives this alot. While initially a villain, Black Cat eventually transitioned into being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicThief">Karmic Thief</a>, and while Spider-Man was bothered by this aspect of her life, he never bothered to turn her in because of their complicated relationship. This gets turned on its head and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>: Otto Octavius who has none of Peter's history or personal bias towards Black Cat, brutally turns her over to the authorities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> has this towards the titular character. Otto steals the body and identity of Spider-Man in order to escape punishment, murders people while operating as the hero, and engages in a relationship with two women, one of whom being long time love interest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane Watson</a>, which borders on sexual assault, but none of this is ever brought up in order to condemn the character, and instead the entire narrative is devoted to Otto's supposed "Redemption." The rationale being that Otto did good things as Spider-Man, and is a good man deep down, which ignores the fact that the story itself shows that the only reason Otto continued to fight crime was to continue his cover and to overshadow Peter's legacy as Spider-Man.
</li><li> Archie LeBrock of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grandville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grandville">Grandville</a></em> apparently only cares what happens to you if he's personally well-acquainted with you. So, while he might lose a lot of sleep and become a nervous wreck over the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarah, whom he slept with and was protecting,</span> he doesn't shed a tear over the fact that he gets lots of other people killed indirectly (sometimes just by talking to them), besides the horrifically brutal tortures and murders he inflicts on both goon squads and innocent policemen alike. Strangely, the only person he personally calls "evil" he actually seems to respect and speak to almost affectionately in a "Why did it have to be like this?" fashion <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as she dies</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TalesOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TalesOfTheJedi">Tales of the Jedi</a></em>: Empress Teta, military dictator of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Koros system</a> and anti-Sith crusader <em>par excellence</em>. She's <em>supposed</em> to be one of the good guys, but there are worrying little things in her portrayal. Like how the POWs from her victorious wars of unification for the greater good are still in hard labor camps a decade after the last war ended. Or how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">the system is renamed the Empress Teta System</a> afterwards. Not to mention conquering other planets in wars which must have killed millions to begin with. which are explicitly described as quite brutal. The heroes don't seem to care since she's on their side. Granted, her enemies, being Sith, are very much worse.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pedestal">Pedestal</a></em>, the protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaks the main antagonist, a terrorist, out of jail</span>. The morality of this is discussed surprisingly little in the fic compared to other issues.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> discusses and deconstructs this with the Avengers, who are repeatedly noted to be a group of heroes who have rules of engagement while on duty, to capture, not kill. However, it is also repeatedly noted and demonstrated that they are capable of being incredibly ruthless, tend to accept no authority but their own, and verge on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">Revenge Before Reason</a> (Loki, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed">Reformed, but Not Tamed</a>, is the go-to man for interrogation, and at one points methodically murders <em>the entire Red Room</em> - who, granted, made HYDRA look soft and cuddly). The narrative points out how this led to a good proportion of the crises of the first two books, directly and indirectly, starting with Lucius Malfoy's HYDRA, which formed because Malfoy (among others) was afraid of Thor/James Potter taking revenge, was far deadlier than its predecessors and, allied with Gravemoss (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">necromancer</a>), briefly took over the world and nearly destroyed the universe. Separately, Doctor Doom, a toned down version of his canon counterpart (who is still a ruthless dictator, albeit a benevolent one), is presented as being justified in his wariness of the Avengers' potentially deciding one day just to depose him because they don't like him.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChristianHumberReloaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChristianHumberReloaded">Christian Humber Reloaded</a>, Vash kills a hunter after a setting off a trap, which breaks on his leg without harming him, and we are apparently supposed to think this is acceptable (the hypocrisy of him doing this despite having set off the trap <em>while hunting</em> is lampshaded in Normalman's webcomic adaptation notes) . His actions get worse from there, including killing a girl and everyone related to her for reporting him to the police, and killing all 6 million people at the Super Bowl to show the cops what it means to fight him. The author treats most of Vash's killings as justified, and when the villains commit comparable or even lesser crimes, they're quickly killed, often by Vash himself.
</li><li> In the world of Cori Falls's fanfiction, the quickest way to gauge whether or not someone's a good person is whether or not they agree with the morals of the protagonists. If you don't think Rex Raptor did the right thing or that Jessie and James's actions weren't justifiable, you're clearly evil. What's really ironic about this is that she accused the <em>Pokemon</em> anime canon of doing this with Ash, despite this clearly not being the case.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> fanfic <em>Tsunami</em> received a lot of complaints because the authors tendency to do this. Namely, everyone depicted positively complains about doing some "hard work", which was a canon event in the series the story was based on (The story basically being a word for word retelling of <em>X-Men Evolution</em> with the addition of an OC), was depicted as just something normal teenagers do at the prospect of hard work. When Scott and Jean made a small comment about how hard this is, who did not complain in the series, they were bashed for being so lazy. This is forgetting that the OC and viewpoint character made a <em>much</em> bigger deal about the hard work two chapters ago. And that's just <em>one</em> example.
</li><li> In general, fanfics that are guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">Ron the Death Eater</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">Die for Our Ship</a> tend to do this. While one character is transformed into an unsympathetic caricature of themselves (if they're lucky), the main character and others will shun, mock, and shame them for every action or inaction they perform, while their love rival can treat them like crap, usually acting worse than the other character is shown doing but treated as if they're the symbol of morality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheConversionBureau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheConversionBureau">The Conversion Bureau</a></em> and many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveFanfiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveFanfiction">its spinoffs</a> sees the ponies forcing humans to either lose their personalities and all other aspects of their selves in the conversion process... or die violently. The ponies are the protagonists. In any other story they'd be utter monsters. Likewise, some stories show the humans as evil simply because they didn't want to convert or they dared to defend themselves against the ponies.
<ul><li> Depending on the story, some of the human focused spinoffs also have this alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed and analysed to a greater extent than canon in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BonneFoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BonneFoi">Bonne Foi</a></em>; where Bella was shown easily accepting how even some of their vampire allies fed on humans in canon, one chapter focuses on her dealing with her own guilt about how she can accept Edwards recent victims because he wouldnt be with her if he hadnt killed them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ImHereToHelp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ImHereToHelp">I'm Here to Help</a></em>:
<ul><li> Emerald's stated goal (to stop Crystal Tokyo's creation, to prevent its people from being brainwashed) is noble enough, but the fic gives virtually no evidence of brainwashing (life seems to go on perfectly normally, from what we hear of it), and his main reasons for not liking life in Crystal Tokyo boil down to that he thinks it's boring. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The same goes for Pluto, at the end. The only reason she gives for having her timeline erased from existence — sending countless unsuspecting people and <em>her own friends</em> into Nothingness — is because Crystal Tokyo didn't turn out how she liked it. No specific reasons, just that.</span>
</li><li> After Serenity came to power, Emerald joined a group of rebels who tried to overthrow her. While their efforts were portrayed as heroic (if doomed to failure), none of them seemed to consider ever trying non-violent means of shaking Serenity's public support, instead opting to launch an incredibly brutal attack on her and her friends. Emerald decries the decreed fate of the rebellion's survivors — banishment from Earth — and hates that the senshi consider it magnanimous, except that sending them to live elsewhere is a pretty light sentence for trying to kill a ruler.
</li><li> A later chapter has Jupiter and Mars discussing the last time they fought Emerald. They are portrayed as being unfeeling about attacking two children that Emerald brought as helpers, while it's ignored that Emerald was the one who brought the children along in the first place.

Zuko never sees anything wrong with what <em>he</em> did, physically assaults Mai and runs off to be with Katara. Consequently, Katara reveals to Zuko that she was planning to hide her child's existence from Zuko for the same reasons, but <em>she</em> is treated as being very considerate and kind for doing so.
</li><li> Eventually, Katara ends up killing Mai. It happened during the heat of a battle, which would lend to the idea of justified self-defense (Mai having attempted to have Katara killed prior, before trying it herself) but that part is never actually considered. And Sokka flat out says it was <em>heroic</em> of Katara to commit murder. Through bloodbending, something that she canonically hated doing. In fact, bloodbending would have allowed Katara to control Mai long enough to take her into custody, so there was no reason to kill her.

Izuku responds that he adheres to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> whenever possible because he doesn't feel it's right to act as judge, jury, and executioner. The moment a Hunter believes that they can kill anyone they please for being "like the Grimm" is the moment a Hunter stops being the protector they've sworn to be. Ozpin calls the response admirable, but naive, bringing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Nana Shimura</a>, the seventh holder of One For All, to mind.

Ochako's attempts to investigate what happened between Katsuki and Izuku are well-intentioned, but since she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">barely knows Izuku here</a>, she sees nothing wrong with constantly harassing him, pushing and prodding for answers. To make matters worse, when she finally drags the truth out of him, her first instinct is to reject it because it's hard for her to accept the notion that her <em>friend</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">has constantly abused Izuku for years</a>.

Ramping up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">already polemic characterization</a> of Erika in the anime, she's made out as the villain because she kicked Ash out of her Gym <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for not liking her perfumes</a>. In turn, Ash outs her as a lesbian after finding out that LGBT people aren't allowed to be Gym Leaders, and he's portrayed as in the right for doing this. The author later rewrote the chapter to remove this element due to the resulting backlash.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlinkyBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlinkyBill">Blinky Bill</a></em> fanfic <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7782580/Scars_Are_Forever">Scars Are Forever<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suffers from this:

When Shifty learns this, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">distraught</a>, but while he brings up that his brother and girlfriend did a crime, he's more upset that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">Nutsy put herself in danger</a>. Then we get a scene of Nutsy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">feeling bad</a>, but not for worrying her mother or committing murder (admittedly, Jeromy was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>, but still), but for breaking Shifty's heart.

Piccolo counters that when he did it, it was for revenge, but #17's doing it for shits and giggles. #17 counters, telling Piccolo that when his creator tells him to "kill Goku" over and over again in his subconscious for a few years, he can ride that high horse all he wants. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Piccolo stops and just gets a major sense of nostalgia at that</a>.

Additionally, the author states that DE (demonic energy) doesn't brainwash humans into wanting to have sex with others, but just removing their inhibitions toward sex.

<ul><li> It shows up, believe it or not, in Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid</a></em>. Chef Louis, who kills and cooks fishes, is treated as a burlesque joke character; the fact that the fish he kills and cooks were clearly <em>sentient</em> is glossed over, as well as the fact that this probably means he killed way more innocent people than Ursula, the film's alleged "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>", ever did. He doesn't even get properly defeated, and we are left to assume he goes back to his genocidal ways at the end of the film while Ariel and Eric enjoy their happy ending. Actually, we don't even <em>have</em> to assume. The sequel shows us that even after years of living in the human kingdom, Ariel still hasn't bothered to tell anyone to stop slaughtering fish, and Chef Louis, <em>still working at the palace</em>, is as ready to cook up Sebastian when he shows up as ever. Why Ariel didn't stop him is anybody's guess, although this inaction is compounded by two facts: 1) Almost no human is aware that the fish are sentient creatures due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> and thus unlikely to believe her, and 2) we're never told that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">mermaids are vegetarian.</a> They are near the top of the sea food chain after all.
</li><li> This trope is in full action in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/VukTheLittleFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/VukTheLittleFox">Vuk the Little Fox</a></em>. Since the story focuses on Vuk, he is treated as a good guy, despite killing a lot of (apparently sentient) animals for food, and systematically destroying a man's property. At the same time, the hunter is treated as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, even though he just kills foxes to protect his livestock. Justified, since Vuk would not survive otherwise.

The very next scene shows the now-hyperdrive-less starship being eaten alive by a space slug.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie">The Emoji Movie</a></em> heavily relies on this. The villain is treated as a despicable control freak despite the dangers posed by an emoji making more than one face. Meanwhile, the film glosses over everything bad that Gene does, even though he doesn't even offer an apology. Gene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leaves Akiko Glitter to die with the trolls</span>, can't hold a face without panicking, and feels entitled to fall in love with Jailbreak — <em>and</em> his adventure actually accelerates Alex's decision to erase all the phone data.

Even her <a class="urllink" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Mirage_(The_Incredibles)">Disney Wiki page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> calls her out on this.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut">Inside Out</a></em> with main character Joy. She's set up as the dominant emotion in Riley's mind and is so determined to keep "her girl" happy that she can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">unknowingly rude</a> to her fellow feelings Fear, Anger, Disgust, and especially Sadness. At first, we view her cheerful nature and happy-go-lucky optimism as "better" than the mentalities of her fellow emotions... until she and Sadness are forced out of Riley's mind headquarters. The rest of the movie is about Joy learning that her innocent selfishness has not only caused huge problems for Riley, it's made her unable to be empathetic to others.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RalphBreaksTheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RalphBreaksTheInternet">Ralph Breaks the Internet</a></em>, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">the first film</a>, it's explicitly stated that game-jumping is bad and there are massive repercussions for Ralph when he temporarily abandons his game to get a medal proving he can be a good guy and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first movie did the same thing, causing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his game, <em>Turbotime</em> and the game he kept jumping into to be shut down for good</span>. In the sequel, Vanellope wanting to abandon <em>Sugar Rush</em> and go to <em>Slaughter Race</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">because she's bored of winning all the time</a> is framed like a natural part of her growing up and <em>Ralph</em> is the one who has to learn to let Vanellope go so she can do the very thing he and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turbo</span> got vilified for in the first movie.
</li><li> Anna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2">Frozen 2</a></em>, as the audience is clearly supposed to sympathise with her when Elsa forces her to stay behind while she goes to explore Ahtohallan and angrily rants to Olaf about how Elsa has left her <em>again</em> ...except that Elsa had every right to do that because unlike Elsa, Anna doesn't have any powers and secondly, the people of Arendelle have been forced out of their home because of some mysterious natural disasters targeting it and need a leader to protect them, but Anna doesn't once stop and think about her people and instead focuses on her abandonment issues and chases obsessively after Elsa until she is physically forced to stop. As Elsa points out, she doesn't know what awaits her at Ahtohallan or even if she'll make it back - Anna is next in line to the throne so logically keeping her back in Arendelle is the best course of action, but Anna never acknowledges Elsa was right about this and just gets angry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">that Elsa broke her promise.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Not to mention, Anna does the exact same thing to Kristoff during the whole movie, repeatedly brushing him off in the same way she accuses of Elsa doing to her.</a>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnQ">John Q.</a></em> has this in spades. The protagonist's son needs a heart transplant but can't afford it. Clearly, the big bad insurance agent is evil for not paying for his son's surgery. So John holds an entire hospital emergency room hostage, threatens to kill people if his son doesn't get a heart, and causes terror. However, there are only so many hearts available for transplant in the world. By blackmailing others to get his son a heart, he stole it from someone else, effectively killing that person. Then his son had his heart transplanted last minute by a group unprepared for the surgery, which lowered the odds of the transplant working. So John gave his son a lower chance of success of surviving the surgery than the person he stole the heart from. Not to mention the whole holding people hostage and thus disrupting an emergency room, which nearly resulted in one person dying due to lack of proper treatment (he gets convicted of that at the end, but he's still treated as right).
</li><li> Jonas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister">Twister</a></em>. He's the bad guy because he 'stole' the idea for Dorothy (even though it obviously wasn't patented and he helped invent it in the first place), got funding for his research, and was 'competing' with the heroes to launch his invention first. But the movie sets him up as evil because he's a jerk to the hero despite the fact that if he succeeded, his data could also save people from tornadoes. Furthermore, Bill walks up and punches Jonas for no reason while Jonas is talking with reporters. And Jonas's "jerk-ness" is him snidely saying "I really like your weather reports", sarcastically complimenting Bill on the job that Bill voluntarily quit tornado chasing to take!
</li><li> The biographical film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MichaelCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MichaelCollins">Michael Collins</a></em> depicts the morality of the IRA's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">terrorist/guerrilla war</a> against the UK largely in terms of what side Collins is on. When Collins is for revolution, revolution is the answer; when Collins decides that the revolution is over and turns his forces against those who want to keep the war going, that's that. The movie makes only half-hearted attempts at ambiguity, clearly basing itself on the audience siding with Collins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jumper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jumper">Jumper</a></em> is based on the audience siding with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, who supports himself with crime enabled by his superpowers. We side with him because the organization who hunts down people with his powers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a> and will kill people who try to help him. The opening scenes have the protagonist ignoring a news story about hundreds of people whose lives are in danger due to a flood so that he can rob a bank and have lunch on top of the sphinx. Note that this is before he knew people wanted to kill him. Neither he nor the hundreds of other teleporters in the world have ever tried to use their powers for good.
</li><li> Averted somewhat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FirstBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FirstBlood">First Blood</a>.</em> What starts as a black and white story of an over zealous sheriff abusing a vagrant 'Nam vet who just wanted to be left alone evolves into a story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality">Graying Morality</a> due to Rambo and Teasle having just the right amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a> to their respective characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em>, Sarah and Nick sabotage some mercenaries hired by the company who owns the dinosaurs. Granted, the team of mercenaries sent to capture the dinosaurs weren't using kid gloves, but the sabotage that the two of them did is directly or indirectly responsible for <em>every human death in the film</em>. Even after the mercenaries save the two of them from death, Nick uses it as an opportunity to sabotage Roland's gun. Apparently, killing a dinosaur is wrong even if it is rampaging through your camp, killing your men. And it wasn't as if nature was at stake. The dinosaurs were created in a lab and introduced in a time period that was unsuitable for them. The fact that they exist at all could be disastrous to the ecosystem. This was the entire point of the first movie and pounded home more in the Lost World book yet somehow, the filmmakers forgot all about that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> is full of this, mostly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>. The Spartans are touted as a just and free society, even though they're shown in the movie to hurl imperfect babies off cliffs, kill messengers, and toss boys into the wilderness as a rite of passage. The sequel makes this explicit, with a few Athenians visiting the city and concluding the Spartans are just lunatics.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry">Tyler Perry</a>'s movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaddysLittleGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaddysLittleGirls">Daddy's Little Girls</a></em>, the protagonist Monty's ex-wife is dating a drug dealer and has taken the kids to live with her. After the custody hearing, Monty purposely hits his ex-wife and her boyfriend Joseph's car and then opens the door and beats up a dizzy and confused Joseph. At Joseph's trial, the entire neighborhood willingly testifies against him for the drug charges (after years of silence), but keeps their mouths shut when Monty is accused of assaulting him.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindingForrester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindingForrester">Finding Forrester</a></em>, William Forrester stands up for his protege Jamal against the bitter English teacher that had a grudge against him. But the film seems to forget the fact that the reason that Professor Crawford was bitter was because Forrester had fraudulently scuttled the man's dreams 20 years earlier by falsely alluding to a non-existent second book, just to encourage publishers not to work with him. Also, Crawford's negative attention on Jamal is because Jamal actually did plagiarize the work that he's being accused of plagiarizing, and Forrester had specifically told Jamal not to use any of his work. Crawford may be a jerk, but he's justified in his actions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnDeadlyGround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnDeadlyGround">On Deadly Ground</a></em> an oil executive pressures his crews to find oil before the exploration permit expires, even if it means harming the environment or ignoring safety regulations. When protesters and employees complain, he hires some paramilitaries to harass troublemakers. When the paramilitaries kill an employee, clearly they are villains. But does this justify destroying the exploration site and presumably causing multiple deaths and millions of dollars in property and environmental damage? Apparently it does, for everyone, including the press, who give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal">Steven Seagal</a> a standing ovation.

This despite the fact that Patch frequently behaves immaturely in class, impersonates a third-year medical student so he can get in to see hospital patients, sneaks into patients' rooms late at night to bombard them with balloons, advocates a "laughter cures everything" approach to medicine that he never even <em>attempts</em> to prove with science, practices medicine out of his house without a license, steals supplies from a hospital, and gets some of the highest grades in school even though no one ever sees him studying (making it perfectly logical to suspect him of cheating). Worst of all, his methods <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">directly lead to the murder of another med student</span>. But of course, since he's the protagonist, anyone who doesn't think he would make a good doctor must be evil.

They hadn't been established as being evil and hadn't done anything against the protagonist other than being on a different team and the outcome of the dive meet had nothing to do with the plot (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> character is on the <em>protagonist's</em> team!).

The fact that they're still <em>criminals</em> who <em>attacked the crown prince</em> and <em>have been making a living by attacking travelers on the road</em> is quickly forgotten, and Henry later invites them to a masquerade ball.

<ul><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/12/06/tf-stuck-in-traffic/">this blog post,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Fred "Slacktivist" Clark notes that the heroes seem more worried about the traffic jam they're stuck in (hindering them from reaching their comrades) than the news of <em>the outbreak of World War III</em> which preceded the traffic jam announcement.
</li><li> Perhaps the neatest example comes early in Book 3. Chloe and Buck are in Chicago after the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>. Their New York home has been destroyed and Chicago itself may be under attack. Loretta, an old woman who belonged to their church, offers to put them up in her house and the two (speaking outside of Loretta's presence) agree to accept this. Not even a <em>page</em> later, during the <em>same conversation</em>, they point out that if it came down to it, the church bomb shelter is too small for Loretta, with the implication that they would leave her to die in the fire.
</li><li> A minor character actually calls them out on it at one point. An acquaintance of the minor character has been pretending to be on the side of the protagonists, but is actually running a kind of con game. They pull a reverse con on him and cheat him, and the minor character says something along the lines of "So, yeah, I don't think I can be your friend any more. Yes, he was trying to cheat you too, but if you're serious about following the teachings of Christ, you're <em>supposed</em> to be better than him."
</li><li> If there's anything that makes other Christians dislike the books, it's the fact that God is just as much prone to this trope as the human characters, because humans are fallible and so can be forgiven for screwing up. God has no excuse. When Nicole Carpathia, the Anti-Christ and servant of Satan mass murders people, it's proof of how evil he is. When God unleashes the deadly plagues and natural disasters that actually kill MORE people than Carpathia does, however, it's a perfectly fine part of the divine plan of an all-loving God. Early in the book, Chloe calls God out on this, saying that no good God would cause the Rapture, and all the disastrous accidents that resulted from the various suddenly unmanned vehicles and infrastructure. She never gets a justification past 'God has his reasons', and the issue is never brought up again, even by the villains.
</li><li> Making deals with the devil is always considered a pretty bad idea, even when you're not a Christian. But that doesn't stop both Rayford and Buck from working for Carpathia after being offered very impressive salaries and work environments. No, they don't accept these offers so that they can get closer to Carpathia in order to assassinate or spy on him. They just take the jobs, because they're good jobs. When Hattie takes a job with Carpathia, not knowing that he's the Anti-Christ, they try to convince her to quit without trying to prove who Carpathia is. That she doesn't accept that the man who brought about world peace is evil, simply on Ray's word, and that she won't quit her incredibly good job as that man's personal assistant, is proof that she's deserving of the fires of Hell.

</li><li> Luke forgiving Vader (and him getting to be a Force Ghost along with the not-evil Obi-Wan and Yoda) is something of a sore spot with a lot of writers. The original films had the luxury of Darth Vader's on-screen evil often being on a lesser scale than other villains (like Tarkin) or directed toward other bad guys. The expanded universe (and later the prequels), made this a lot more awkward by actually showing what gave Darth Vader his reputation. Some authors note that the rest of the galaxy still views Vader as nothing more than a mass-murdering monster, and Leia (who was <em>tortured</em> by Vader when she was <em>nineteen</em>) is portrayed as hating Vader for years afterwards and furious at Luke that he was so presumptuous as to forgive Vader on behalf of his <em>millions</em> of victims. Yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">other writers</a> still present this as unnecessarily holding onto hatred rather than a reasonable reaction to the top enforcer of a totalitarian dictatorship. Supposedly, the metaphysics of the Force are at play; a regular person can afford to hate, but a Force sensitive who indulges in hatred, no matter how justified, will fall to the dark side. Leia eventually makes peace with the idea that there was an Anakin Skywalker before there was a Vader.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the biggest complaints against the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series is how pretty much everyone who disagrees with Bella is instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonized</a> to some extent, while Bella suffers no repercussions for treating others like crap.
<ul><li> Charlie opposed Bella and Edward's relationship because, well, if your only daughter suddenly came home one day and tells you she wants to marry a guy who had left her heartbroken and nearly suicidal once before, you'd be worried. Her mother just wants her to give more thought about going to college before settling down. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Her friends</a> from school who came around pretty much every day while she had her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and seemed to genuinely care for her well-being? She just thought they were getting annoying; so did the author.
</li><li> Many of Edward's and Jacob's actions were typical of an abusive relationship, but they were portrayed as being perfectly okay and even <em>romantic.</em> Edward stalks her and watches her sleep? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkingIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkingIsLove">It just shows how much he loves her!</a> He breaks her car and has his sister kidnap her to keep her from visiting another boy?

Again, it just shows how much he loves her!
</li><li> The "good" vampires appear not to have thought of using their immeasurable powers to save people's lives; they're more content to repeat high school for the umpteenth time and play baseball, and seem to be happy with their brethren slaughtering innocent people as long as they leave Bella alone. And Bella herself doesn't lift a finger to help anyone even when she knows they're as good as vampire food. This is shown clearly in <em>Eclipse</em>, where an army of uncontrollable newborn vampires is only four hours away from them destroying Seattle, but none of the Cullens or Bella even consider trying to stop them until they start to think the Seattle-based vampires might be coming for them next. Toward the beginning, they explicitly pass it off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodyElsesProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodyElsesProblem">Somebody Else's Problem</a>.
</li><li> Bella has a rather telling moment in <em>Eclipse</em> when the Cullens know a battle with a large group of hostile vampires is coming, and Bella finds out that vampires become a little stronger if they feed on human blood versus the Cullens' normal diet of animal blood. She realizes she's perfectly okay with condemning someone to death if it <em>slightly improves</em> the odds of her boyfriend surviving the battle. And by <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the Cullens have agreed that they need backup if the Volturi are coming to get their murder on, so they call in every favor they have with the other vampires. Now, the Cullens have sworn to feed only on the blood of animals, these vampires have not, and yet the Cullens are happy to lend them their car to go hunting for humans (and vampires in the setting inevitably kill any human they feed on, unless they're turned) — just as long as Bella doesn't get hurt. Oh, and that they hunt outside Forks so people Bella knows won't die.

The actions of various protagonists are consistently applauded — including one man judge/jury/execution, destruction of entire planets/solar systems/civilizations, with or without noncombatants, various nasty means of underhanded (or overhanded) warfare, torture, mind rape, etc. It's stated in-story that only paragons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a> can ever be Lensmen in the first place (and that the Arisians are actively weeding out those who fall short just before they actually get Lenses), but we do have to kind of take the author's word for it.

Vimes evades giving an explanation, and privately admits to himself that his main justification is "It's Me Doing It" — and that this is a pretty poor justification, especially because it's the one the people on the other side are using too (and he feels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">he could do worse if he let himself</a>, but he doesn't).

</li><li> When Venus is introduced <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has just recently regained her humanity</span> but she is deemed a horrible bitch and possibly evil in the first chapter of <em>Hunted</em>, despite how Venus's personality is very close to that of Aphrodite.

Zoey was telling herself that it was wrong to behave and think the way she did, didn't stop it anyway.</span>
</li><li> Zoey and her friends all call Aphrodite a "ho" for dating two guys, even though she began going out with the second one only sometime after the first one and is genuinely serious about him. Zoey, meanwhile, has dated/flirted with no less than four guys, lost her virginity to her teacher Loren while she was dating Erik and letting Heath continually lure her into feasting on his blood, and she <em>repeatedly</em> calls herself out for being unable to settle on one guy. And yet when Erik calls her out on this in a later book, he's dismissed as just a jealous jerk by all her friends and we're clearly meant to disagree with her being a ho even when she keeps on saying that she <em>is</em> and is <em>right</em>.
</li><li> Raven Mockers are mindless creatures of Darkness and they should all be wiped out. Everybody agrees with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> attitude and, as of <em>Burned</em>, around twenty Raven Mockers have been killed.

</li><li> How is it okay for the Red Fledglings that haven't "Chosen" yet to be running around killing people? Even after Stevie Rae gives them multiple chances to choose, and they try to kill her and her friends multiple times, she ends up just chasing them away/exiling them... as if wherever they end up, they'll be any less evil and bloodthirsty? It could simply be a moment of weakness, but the fact that they're Red Fledglings and thus "her people" seems to be what keeps her from stopping them from murdering any more innocents.
</li><li> The authors almost poke fun at this in Chapter 6 of <em>Revealed</em>, when Kalona calls Zoey out for making a tactless comment concerning personal morality and Stark jumps to her defense, telling Kalona that he "just [doesn't] <em>get</em> her." Zoey is then shown to get all worked up and zone out when she realises that (gasp!) Kalona's assessment <em>might be right</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Hunted</em>, Zoey catches Stark raping a vampire girl through forcible blood drinking, but ignores Darius condemning him because Nyx herself guides Zoey into deciding to redeem Stark. On the flipside, in <em>Tempted</em>, Zoey calls Stark out on what he did and Stark angrily declares that she's been misled and turned against him by Kalona.

<ul><li> Barak drunkenly raped his wife in the backstory, but nobody cares (except Barak himself, and then only in a 'kinda regrets the circumstances' way), because he's a good guy - though that could be coloured by the fact that the only one who heard about it is a 14 year old Garion, and the terminology was sufficiently obscure that while most readers would get it straight off, it goes straight over Garion's head, meaning that no one else may actually have known.

</li><li> Sadi dealt drugs like candy, including powerful hallucinogens and poisons.
</li><li> Silk nearly wiped out an entire family for the actions of a few, Hettar openly admits to murdering people on the road just because they were Murgos, and Polgara and Belgarath are much worse. The attitude seems to be 'If they're not on our side, they're horrible people who do horrible things. If they are on our side, they're good people who just made some bad choices.' Yeah, try telling that to the thousands of dead Murgos.
</li><li> Lampshaded many times when each person (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Silk</a>) admits to having various vices and refusing to accept it as being the same as the vices of others. Belgarath even refuses to classify it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Good vs. Evil</a> and instead prefers to call it "them versus us."

</li><li> In the case of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zakath</span>, it's a bit more ambiguous. It's noted a) that he spent most of the series as a cold-blooded monster, as a product of being manipulated into executed the woman he loved when he'd just taken the throne, which drives his genocidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>, b) nearly has a breakdown when he realises that pretty much everything he's done since the end of <em>The Belgariad</em> has been absolutely pointless, c) very nearly reverts after he feels as if he's been betrayed by the heroes. In other words, he's not presented as performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> overnight, nor is it presented as either smooth or easy.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium">The Elenium</a></em>, the Sparhawk's party slaughters enemies by dozens. They even kill in cold blood an unsympathetic teenage bastard who was unarmed and harmless. They only lose a single member by the end, killed in a fair fight while invading the enemy's HQ. Reaction of the party? They take this justified battle killing as a vile murder and the murderer is slowly and violently tortured to death. And the lost party member is mourned aloud as if it was very unusual for warriors to be killed in battle. We'll hear no remorse from Sparhawk for <em>his</em> murders.
<ul><li> The "tortured murderer" example is easy to miss, since the victim was in fact a raping, torturing, murdering monster who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">totally deserved his fate</a>; it's just that their reaction was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> for <em>that</em> killing.

One can argue that the questionable behavior up until that point was just washing one's hands clean of a broken system, but actively and intentionally murdering someone as a way of announcing an entrance can't be excused that easily.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>'s protagonists routinely get away with being huge jerks to other characters.

In <em>Crystal Line,</em> Killashandra humiliates a scientist for more than a page for the sole offense of being pedantic and giving a new substance a different name than she gave it, and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, and viciously justified a few pages later with descriptions of how space-sick the scientist and his partner got all over the ship that brought them in.

However, he makes it abundantly clear that he is unhappy with this burden and that he will make compromises that he thinks will benefit his people despite having near-absolute power with which to impose his will as he sees fit. He is also the one holding Miles' leash (personally in the later books, rather than through Simon as in earlier books) and he expects a degree of restraint even though Miles as an Imperial Auditor could be the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> if allowed to do so.

She also agrees to give up her own noble right to duel the noble offender when the King agrees to change the law since that would undercut the point that the law must apply to all.

</li><li> There is a particularly blatant example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter">The Scarlet Letter</a></em>. The antagonist Chillingworth does objectively good things: he gains great medical knowledge from the Indians at considerable personal risk and uses it for the benefit of the community. When Chillingworth comes home to see his wife (and indirectly himself) publicly shamed, he comforts Hester, medicates her and her daughter, and mostly blames himself for his wife's infidelity. He helps Dimmesdale medically and emotionally by correctly insisting that Dimmesdale will never fully recover until he relieves himself of whatever is weighing down his heart. Despite these good acts, the Puritans of Boston seem ungrateful for having a man who has put so much effort into becoming a great doctor for them and seem to interpret everything he does in the worst possible light. Everyone, including the narrator and Chillingworth himself, assumes that he is doing everything for the very worst of reasons. Just to hammer in his badness, the narrator makes Chillingworth ugly, and uglier as the story goes on. Protagonist Dimmesdale, on the other hand, does objectively bad things by ruining Hester's life and making Pearl grow up a poor pariah. He is extremely hypocritical in participating in the public shaming of Hester, even pretending to try to make her give away the name of her lover. He neither has the courage to confess and face the consequences nor to take his secret to the grave, instead choosing the most cowardly possible solution <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(he waits until he only has seconds left to live to confess)</span>. Yet he obviously has the sympathy of the narrator, Hester, and all of Boston.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a></em> series, Anita starts sliding down the slippery slope of morality by the seventh or eighth book, noting how she's less affected by things as the series goes on, and can do things that morally she would have balked at earlier. However, everything she does is portrayed as the right and correct decision at the time, regardless of the consequences (and some of the things she's done would result in her perfectly legal summary execution), and she's quite willing to kill people for committing lesser crimes than she has who had decidedly greater justification than hers. She even set one character up who was supposedly under her protection to be hunted down and murdered simply because he refused to have sex with her. This was presented as the appropriate response to the reader.
</li><li> A lot of the behavior displayed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a> is downright meddlesome, snoopy, and intrusive, all of which is portrayed as perfectly okay, as she's a detective and the people she's displaying this behavior towards are jerks and/or suspects in her case. When anyone else acts like this, they are rightfully called out on their rudeness. This gets to the point where Nancy demands clarification on information that she learned while eavesdropping on a man's private conversation, and <em>he's</em> the one made to be the bad guy for screaming at her to mind her own business. Multiple times throughout the <em>Files</em> series, however, Nancy is blasted for this by everyone — Bess, George, Ned, even her own father — and her conduct is bad enough to cause a rift in her relationships with these people.
</li><li> The second book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCobraTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCobraTrilogy">The Cobra Trilogy</a></em> has the titular Cobra super-soldiers agree to consider attacking the planet Qasama (which they know nothing about) in exchange for new territory elsewhere. They go to Qasama pretending to be a diplomatic party while actually spying, and when caught, kill a lot of Qasamans and threaten to do more damage until they're allowed to leave. Then they come back in greater force to conduct experiments, and kill more Qasamans to make their getaway. Their conclusion: Jeez, these people we've attacked twice are a damn <em>menace</em>, aren't they? We've got to start a full-scale war with them, quick! (The fact that the Qasamans used spy tricks and violence against the Cobras is cited as proof that they're dangerous, even though the Cobras were first to spy and first to kill.) In the end, the Cobras find a solution short of war which will "only" overturn the foundations of Qasaman society. But it's the Cobras doing all this, so yay! A few people on the Cobra side note that the conflict was probably unnecessary, but even then, most treat it as a strategic blunder rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">maybe-we're-the-bad-guys realisation</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twisted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twisted">Twisted!</a></em>, Railrunner gushes about how much he loves drinking blood and killing, and during his initial transformation and rampage, straight-out murders dozens of cops who were just doing his duty, then has the audacity to bitch that no one accepts him as he really is. He also has no problem with killing the Fallen, even though they're evil through no fault of their own... and he's the good guy!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars">The Fault in Our Stars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hazel frequently berates others for things they do or say, then does or says the same things herself, usually stating that it's okay when she does them. Vandalism is to be applauded when main characters engage in it, because how dare Isaac's girlfriend back out of a relationship she wasn't emotionally prepared to handle?
</li><li> Peter van Houten treats Hazel and Gus the way they treat most other people, only he's more blunt about it. We're meant to think he's horrible while Hazel and Gus are wonderful. They have an expensive dinner on his expense then come inside his home against his express wishes, yet they are sympathetic and he is not because he refuses to indulge Hazel's desire to know what happened to the characters in his book after the book ended, even though when he does, Hazel throws a temper tantrum and throws his drink in his face.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Fabulous Five</em> series (or rather, its prequels), the titular characters have a club whose primary goal is find ways to humiliate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> Taffy Sinclair, mostly out of jealousy over the fact that she's pretty. This is portrayed as right—even with the girls eventually being chewed out for their behavior—presumably because readers are assumed to be empathizing with the girls rather than with Taffy.
</li><li> Quite prevalent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissionEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissionEarth">Mission Earth</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPsychologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPsychologist">Psycho Psychologists</a> using their black arts to twist the minds of their victims is evil, but the protagonists using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoTrinket">hypno-helmets</a> to reprogram their enemies into doing what they want is fine. The difference between the bad guys on Earth using Public Relations to manipulate the masses and the protagonist using Advanced Symbolic Logic to do the same is that the protagonists' civilization was doing it first. Even the books' central plot boils down to an attempt to free planet Earth from a tyrannical overlord so that an alien empire can conquer it over instead.
</li><li> An interesting example in Poul S. Kidd's <em>Fangs of K'aath</em>: while two of the main antagonists both enact their plots for the exact same reasons, the one who does <em>far</em> more horrific things over a longer period is given a sympathetic death scene simply because of a connection to the protagonist, while the other is simply shot dead and forgotten. Namely, both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiraj and Farasche want to see their sons succeed to the throne. The difference is that Shiraj has <em>raised Raschid to be the host for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> since birth</em>, uses her favorite slave as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a>, then tries to possess Raschid's girlfriend instead, and finally herself—and as a bonus, she also turns Abbas into a monster. Abbas's mother Farasche, on the other hand, merely tries to assassinate Raschid and stage a mundane coup. But Raschid is the protagonist</span>.
</li><li> The average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleSteel">Danielle Steel</a> book will have any and all behavior by her heroes and heroines portrayed as perfectly okay, while identical behavior from the villains is despicable. In <em>The Wedding</em>, a woman comes home from a business trip to find her boyfriend cavorting with another woman; she tells him off and throws him out, conveniently forgetting that she herself spent her trip having a fling with another man, who turns out to be her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">One True Love</a>, whom she marries at the end of the book in the titular ceremony. There's also her numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">May-December romances</a> being portrayed as perfectly common and normal—to the point where no one bats an eye at a 62-year-old man marrying an <em>18-year-old</em> girl (in <em>A Perfect Stranger</em>), or a 49-year-old man falling in love with a <em>15-year-old</em> girl (in <em>Family Album</em>). Unless you're a villain. Then, <em>you</em> "look like an idiot" with your younger girlfriend, even though the age difference is only 15 years.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em>, Professor Snape's open favoritism of the Slytherins  giving them extra points, shaming the Gryffindors in their presence, tipping the scales so the Slytherins look good and the Gryffindors do not, and so on  is used to characterize him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who refuses to see past House loyalties and focus on individual students. By the end of the book, the Slytherins have won the House Cup, largely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Professor McGonagall</a> penalizing her own House for Harry, Neville, and Hermione's reckless behavior. Yet when Dumbledore (a Gryffindor) uses the Leaving Feast to award Gryffindor enough points to put them in the lead, snatching the House Cup from the Slytherins at the last minute and giving it to the Gryffindors, it is portrayed as a happy ending and a triumph.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> tells the story of brave patriots seceding from the US in the face of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>, to preserve traditional Christian values. In the course of this, they seize federal land to sell to foreign developers, kidnap, torture, make liberal use of hostages and human shields, threaten the families of servicemen who fight against them, execute captured soldiers <em>en masse</em>, assist a foreign invasion of the US, bomb their own allies, nuke an ally's city, threaten nuclear war with China, violently purge ideologically unreliable academics, and more. These are, at worst, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">strictly necessary</a> actions of a reasonable figure, more often, outright celebrated. Unlike the federal opposition. When the heroes take pilots and their families hostage to deter bombing, it's a clever outside-the-box tactic, when the Feds assassinate a Confederate leader, it's a vile crime. When good Christians are sold into slavery in the Middle East, no effort or expense can be spared in securing their return home; when defeated feminists are sold into sexual slavery in the Middle East, it's only their just comeuppance and a chance to show them what <em>real</em> patriarchal oppression looks like.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>:
<ul><li> Early on, the protagonist and narrator, Taylor, is offered a chance to work with the Undersiders, a gang of superpowered teenage villains working for a mysterious boss. She accepts the offer with the notion of insinuating herself into their group to hand over valuable intel to the local Protectorate, a group of adult heroes, via Armsmaster, who owes her a favor. Although she does this without the approval or knowledge of the Protectorate, she still goes to Armsmaster <em>after</em> she's accepted the Undersiders' offer and asks him to ensure she stays out of prison should things go sour. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Armsmaster predictably refuses, pointing out that the favor she's calling in—allowing him to take credit for apprehending a dangerous gangster named Lung—blew up in his face due to her own recklessness. Rather than apologizing and asking what she can do to help, Taylor gets angry with Armsmaster and storms out to go her own way.</span> Armsmaster is portrayed as insensitive and stubborn, with Taylor comparing him to the bullies who abuse her on a daily basis.
<ul><li> We do later learn that Armsmaster is known for being a bit of a self-aggrandizing tool, and has been looking for ways to boost his reputation after failing as a leader. It's more likely that we aren't supposed to be siding with either the selfish teenager OR the selfish adult here.
</li><li> Armsmaster then later gets a dose of this trope as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After violating a truce to defend Brockton Bay from a giant monster so he can get all the glory and then revealing Skitter's identity as an informant during the aftermath,</span> he is placed under house-arrest and striped of his titles. His actions even earn him a nomination into the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Slaughterhouse Nine</span> when they come to town, but he uses the chaos to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">join a different team under a different name.</a> Under his new identity, Armsmaster acts like more a hero, but is never questioned more than once for his past actions, as he's now on the side of good.
</li></ul></li><li> Taylor is also horrifically abused by a group of bullies at school, with one incident even requiring she be admitted to the psychiatric ward and drugged to help her calm down. The effects of this bullying, and the school's cavalier attitude toward it, are shown to be far-reaching and catastrophic. However, when one of these bullies is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">forced to destroy her relationships with friends and family, implicate herself in a crime, and forfeit her job, leaving a life of homelessness or suicide as her only options</span>, it is treated as a fully justifiable and satisfying comeuppance.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Taylor herself was never aware of all that and when partially informed, unaware one of her teammates had orchestrated it, felt bad over it. And even later near the end, it's revealed even the one who had secretly orchestrated it had second thoughts, feeling he had gone too far.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> As with everything about Armsmaster above (on both sides of this trope), this becomes a major theme of the story. Centered around the interactions between Heroes and Villains, one character describes the whole thing as a high-stakes game of 'Cops and Robbers'. As long as Villains act within certain boundaries, they are given pseudo-legal leeway, only true monsters like the S9 and unapologetic murderers like the ABB being treated harshly for their crimes. Meanwhile Heroes are given very long leashes when it comes to their actions, being protected from the law <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlavetoPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlavetoPR">as long as they don't make their bosses look bad.</a> This is all in service of the idea that both Heroes and Villains will team up against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorld">Endbringers</a>. The resultant culture is dubbed 'The Unwritten Rules', a code by which both Heroes and Villains agree to follow. Essentially, as long as you agree to work toward the greater good, or at least not upset the balance, any crimes committed can be swept under the rug...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsianSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsianSaga">Asian Saga</a></em>: Subverted with shades of deconstruction. Dirk Struan, the protagonist of <em>Tai-Pan</em> is... not a very nice person. He comes across fairly well, due to having very progressive attitudes about employer-employee relations, intercultural interaction and corporal punishment, but is completely ruthless in dealing with anyone who opposes him, in business or at sea. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>, Tyler Brock, has more typical attitudes in regards to race, violence and the treatment of women, but firmly believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a> and in many ways holds himself to a higher standard than Struan (among other things, he insists that Struan be "broken regular" i.e. killed in a fair fight, whereas Struan showed no qualms about sending a triad hit squad after Brock's son). Both Struan and Brock are POV characters at some point, and it is clear that, from their perspective and with the information they have, both are doing what they think is best for their families and the people around them. Both men are also very well aware that they are not angels, but rough-and-tumble China traders and opium smugglers, and that a lot of what they do as a matter of course is morally dodgy at best. Both men throw the phrase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">I Did What I Had to Do</a> around with abandon.
<ul><li> A telling scene is when Brock attempts to sink a lorcha carrying bullion Dirk Struan intends to use to pay off a huge debt to Brock,, who has been buying up Struan's mortgages in the hope of driving him out of business. Culum goes on a long rant about how Brock should hang for a pirate. Dirk just shrugs and says that if he had been in Brock's shoes he would have done exactly the same thing, and that Brock's only crime was failure.
</li><li> When <em>Noble House</em> rolls around some 200 years later Ian Dunross and Quillan Gornt (descendants of Struan and Brock, respectively) have romanticized the events of <em>Tai-Pan</em> thoroughly, and both openly consider their respective forefather to be a paragon and the other's a vile villain.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorDogs">Survivor Dogs</a></em> book, the innocently naive Fierce Dog pups lampshade the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion">Carnivore Confusion</a> that comes with the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalReligion">Animal Religion</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit">Forest-Dog</a> watches over the animals of the forest and if he's pleased with a dog he'll "give" them prey. Lick gets confused and asks "But if the Forest-Dog watches over the trees and animals, doesn't that mean he watches over voles and rabbits too?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HettyFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HettyFeather">Hetty Feather</a></em>: The entire series is actually child and teenaged Hetty's memoirs, where she even admits herself to writing childish babble.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy">The Han Solo Trilogy</a></em>: After learning his account's been frozen as Corellian Security has learned that he had deposited proceeds from selling stolen goods, Han takes the bank manager hostage before he can get arrested. This gets the man killed as he's shot when stormtroopers try to stop Han escaping. Yes, he didn't intend it, but it's probably the worst thing Han does in the trilogy. He never has to face any consequences for it either. This is just fine apparently, because he is the hero.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>'s "You Belong With Me." The opening lyrics state that the boyfriend is having an argument with his girlfriend. She's apparently offended by something that he said. The next lyric is "she doesn't get your humour like I do". Because of course since Taylor is the narrator, her romantic rival clearly has to be in the wrong. She must of course be overreacting to a joke, rather than have a legit reason to be offended at something her boyfriend said to her. (The video plays with this by having Taylor portray both the narrative character of the song <em>and</em> the girlfriend.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s "Juicy" starts with a spoken word segment where Biggie says that the album is dedicated to "all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter". Apparently illegally dealing drugs is okay provided that the money goes to your daughter.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveMillerBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveMillerBand">Steve Miller Band</a>'s "Take the Money and Run." A pair of young, possibly teenage protagonists rob and murder someone, then escape the police and flee to Mexico.

So in WWE's kayfabe, Roman Reigns got an innocent woman fired for his own benefit and wasn't punished for it in any way aside from not winning the title. Sure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>'s used the same tactic herself years ago to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane</a> get the jump on her husband's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">best friend</a>, but considering she's that ruthless, you would think she'd also be ruthless enough to, y'know, <em>selectively forget that and punish Roman Reigns somehow</em> in order to separate the difference between the two.
</li><li> As noted above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> runs into this <em>a lot</em>. Over the course of nearly a decade and a half, Cena has piled up quite a list, which includes but is not limited to: hitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Attitude Adjustment</a> off the roof of a car and through a hole in the stage, after Batista begged him not to; viciously attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana">Rusev</a> outside of any match, putting him in a submission hold and making him tap out <em>and pass out</em> just to get him and Lana to agree to a match at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 31</em>, when doing something very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> was meant to be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>; and challenging a worn-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> to a match for the WWE title on the same night Rey won it for the first and only time in his career (notable especially because Rey might be even more of a "perpetual face" than Cena), when both before and since this event Cena would often be first in line to take moral umbrage with anyone using Money in the Bank advantageously to become champion. This is one of the biggest criticisms of Cena, as he is shown doing things like this frequently, but it is almost never acknowledged and even then only by heels who are meant to be wrong.
</li><li> The ultimate example, though, could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, who did things that should have had him thrown in prison yet always got him cheered. He threatened the very lives of Vince McMahon and others to get title matches. He assaulted women in the ring — morally questionable enough when it's an Alpha Bitch like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, but he also did it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a>, who was being portrayed as an abuse victim in storyline. But perhaps the worst was his 1999-2000 feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, where he threw Trips in an ambulance and then smashed the ambulance with a semi — just because he didn't win their Triple Threat match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> for the title at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a></em>; this led to HHH setting Austin up to get hit by a car at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series</a></em>; when Austin found that out a year later, their next match ended with Austin trying to <em>crush Triple H to death in a car with a forklift</em>. And Triple H was still called a "son of a bitch" by Jim Ross when he broke up Austin's title match two weeks later; to repeat, Triple H was supposedly the absolute bad guy for ruining a title opportunity of the guy who <em>tried to kill him TWICE.</em>

The angle played across both promotions, sometimes both of them having joint shows in the same building (which were agreed upon well before Hero instigated open conflict) with the CZW fans cheering every CZW talent despite their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">petty and disproportionate</a> actions, except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Steen</a>, the only CZW wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">pointing out</a> CZW wrestlers and ownership were being petty and disproportionate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">begging ROH to take him</a>, and booing everyone associated with ROH, who were mainly trying to defend themselves or their property except when they were trying to avenge the people already hurt or property already destroyed by CZW, booed them all except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Claudio Castagnoli</a>, who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">mole</a> within the ROH locker room.

Almost every book published by the Black Library is Imperial propaganda, and the fluff included in each faction's codex casts them in a good light (with the exception of Chaos and Tyranids, both of which are mostly from Imperial point of view as well, probably because the stars of those books are insane or all devouring cosmic horrors).

<ul><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods">Into the Woods</a></em>. The first act sees fairy tale characters Jack (the one who climbs a beanstalk), Cinderella, and Little Red Riding Hood living their famous stories, while a new couple—a childless Baker and his Wife—try to break the spell on their family by collecting items from those characters. All five of these main characters do sneaky, underhanded things to achieve their dreams, but they still have our support...until Act Two comes along, and Sondheim shows us just what the consequences of the characters' wishes have been. For instance, the Giant's wife appears and points out that she welcomed Jack into her home—despite his being a complete stranger—and offered him food and care, only for Jack to repeatedly return and steal money, a golden egg-laying goose, and a singing harp. The first theft was perhaps the worst, as he didn't even allow the Giantess to explain the situation to her husband; he simply stole from her and ran for it. Jack then eventually killed the Giant, and no one cared because he was a "monster." But his wife did, and she is <em>angry.</em> While killing the Giant's Wife becomes a goal in Act II, Red Riding Hood does weigh out the morality of killing the Giant's wife and while Cinderella judges that it's the best decision for now, being that the wife caused so much harm to the kingdom, she also acknowledges in song that "giants can be good."
</li><li> Discussed in "Stepsisters' Lament," a song from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em>. The stepsisters, watching Cinderella dance with the Prince, point out that conventionally pretty but mysterious girls—"frail and fluffy beauties" who are "obviously unusual"—always end up with happy endings and the support of the audience, while "solid," "usual" women like them are inevitably left with nothing. It's worth noting that these stepsisters, while somewhat mean, have a softer, kinder side. Their final fates vary depending on the version — in the original 1957 TV production and its stage adaptation they and their mother are at the wedding celebrating Cinderella's good fortune, while in the 1997 TV movie remake they all end up cast out of the palace. In the 2013 Broadway version one of the sisters is part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a> so "Stepsisters' Lament" is sung only by the other, backed by the chorus. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This sister and the stepmother make Heel-Face Turns at the end, as Cinderella's forgiveness moves them.</span>

While they may be general all-round heroes in fighting whatever threatens humanity, they only have selfish impulses that makes them focused on one prime purpose for taking on the forces of evil, usually related to them. Most of the time they are all about indulging and entertaining themselves in hunting down demons and threats that are sufficiently cool, and only consider the thousands, or millions, of casualties a part of the job at worst.

It's revealed that a Prime Field named Origin has control over the Amaterasu unit, and is therefore essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">god</a>, having complete control over time itself. Origin then uses its power to ensure that time only moves forward if her 'Successor', Noel, is alive and living her best possible life; any other outcome causes time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">reset</a>. Noel's best case scenario happens to involve an entire civil war breaking out and several named characters being much worse off or dead.

Furthermore, when Izanami revealed the truth of Origin's goals to the world, several people turned on Noel herself and started trying to kill her.

After all, to develop a vaccine, you first need a sample of the virus. Plenty of other examples are given throughout playing both campaigns, which was an intentional design.

He remarks, "But I'm fighting evil. It's different. Look it up." All joking aside, this is a case where you're supposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">applaud the hero for calling the villain out</a>, since said villain is attempting genocide on human civilians whereas Pit is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">retaliating</a> against strictly military targets.

</li><li> This is a major facet of Alicesoft's flagship <em>Rance</em> series. The titular protagonist considers rape, theft and murder to be unforgivable offenses... just as long as he isn't the one doing them, in which case they're acts of absolute, unquestionable justice. On a more mundane level, he's quick to criticize others for behaviors or ideas that he is equally as guilty of having, only to completely deny it when someone points his hypocrisy out to him. This is all very intentional and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, as Rance is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> and all of his allies are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormats</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judges of Character</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">rational people</a> who have resigned themselves to mostly tolerating his behavior due to their understanding of his incredible strength.

He first met <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Lia</a>, one of the series' most recurring heroines, while foiling a sex trafficking ring involving kidnapping and torturing young women to the point of insanity that she was running for her own amusement.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Selvaria</a>, being a Valkyria, is a terrifying enemy who remorselessly slaughters thousands of Gallians, but only until we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alicia is one too</span>, and once she has a connection to the protagonists, her villain status immediately begins to wane. The heroes are much more upset about her capture than they are about the castle full of soldiers she obliterates, the player is expected to feel much more for her than her victims, and the plot pays so much more attention to her that the fact that her capture was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a> is never even addressed by her survivors.

She's being exploited for her powers and only kills mooks that no one cares about, so the story treats her like a tragic figure who is good at heart, but isn't in control of her own destiny. Then she spares Squad 7, thus sabotaging Maximillian's assured victory at the last minute, <em>but she kills those thousands of soldiers anyway</em>. The way the story plays out, the tragedy is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she committed suicide</span>, not that a sizable portion of Gallia's entire population was just murdered during a truce.
</li><li> Faldio <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots Alicia to awaken her Valkyria powers</span>, which stops Selvaria from destroying what's left of the Gallian military and winning the war. Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedEvil">no one disagrees that his plan worked when no one else had any other ideas</a>, the story utterly condemns him for choosing the many over the one because the one is a main protagonist and the many were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, and while he's punished for treason, the story shows us he was wrong because his plan to save the day required harming a main character instead of just trusting that they'd figure out a way themselves. It's especially notable that he openly states that it's <em>because</em> no one had a solution that he even went to such lengths to begin with, and in the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">the plot proves it was necessary</a>.

</li><li> The only Imperial soldiers given any sympathetic treatment are the one that dies in Alicia's lap, and the captain of his unit who lets Alicia and Welkin leave in peace instead of killing them while they're alone in the woods without backup; it's supposed to be a way of showing that the Imperials are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>, but since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">they go right back to acting like assholes</a> for the rest of the game, it seems that the only way the Imperials can be good people is by being good to the lead couple.

It appears in the beginning of the game before Alexander has any real reason to question the legitimacy of the marriage, but Alhazared is obviously the villain and, at the very least, is oppressing Cassima to the point of keeping her under house arrest.

They are also notably sympathetic to him <em>despite</em> the fact that as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the leader of the Imperial Liberation Front</span>, he was a clear-cut terrorist who repeatedly targeted military lives, and endangered innocent ones (including those of his own classmates and supposed friends), in a complex gambit to weaken Osborne's position in Erebonia and eventually assassinate him.

While explaining his past, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crow</span> makes no effort to assert his righteousness, fully admitting that his crusade was little more than a gamble to get revenge, downplays his tragic past as "just another sob story", and even goes as far as to say that Osborne wasn't even necessarily an evil man for what he did.

</li><li> Rather than an accident of writing, this is very much the <em>point</em> of the mainline <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> series, and its tactical spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em>. The idea of these narratives is that the Protagonist is not just finding his own path in the world, but is ultimately defining the ideology that the new world will follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldSpecial">after it is reborn in the fire and destruction of the current one</a>. Is the Protagonist acting like a seemingly charitable, messianic, but ultimately authoritarian and oppressive leader? He's steadily aligning himself with the policies of YHVH and Law. Is he taking selfish, self-serving actions that others find cruel or dismissive? He's just expressing a bent for the ultimate personal freedom that Lucifer and Chaos represent. By the end of the games, it's the Protagonist's morality that rules and defines the new society, whether humans, angels, or demons are around to enforce it.

Where traditional Neutral factions, and the Freedom path of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em>, align naturally with current morals and ethics in the real world, and therefore the Protagonist's morality is beholden to "our" real-world value system, <em>IV</em> eschews this option and defines its Protagonist's morality as exhibiting authoritarian and anarchist beliefs in equal measure.

After the Third Grail War this restriction was removed due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the corruption of the Grail by Angra Mainyu</span>.
<ul><li> In the Unlimited Blade Works route, the concept of Protagonist-Centered Morality is roundly criticized by Archer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He became a hero hoping to save people, but this ultimately meant leaving a long trail of dead people in his path.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KoiToSenkyoToChocolate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KoiToSenkyoToChocolate">Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate</a></em>, the protagonist is a member of the school's Food Research club, which barely does any actual research and instead functions almost exclusively as a hangout for friends (the club members) who eat snacks bought with funds the school provides them. When election time comes and a major candidate for president campaigns on a platform that includes disbanding or reducing the budget for low-merit clubs such as themselves and redirect it to more active ones, she is presented as somehow being wrong. In addition, the club members express their annoyance over another presidential candidate playing around the election rules by giving out gift cards for the school cafeteria the week prior to the start of the elections (bribes are forbidden when election period officially begins), but when they decide to participate in the election with their own candidate, they violate the spirit of the rule by giving out free candy that's technically considered an election leaflet because they put stickers with election material on the packaging.
</li><li> Briefly discussed at various points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DiesIrae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DiesIrae">Dies Irae</a></em>. How a person is viewed morally ultimately comes down to either how well you know them yourself or how they align with your own views. Generally, then everyone who does not fit this we label as evil to justify ourselves. Meanwhile, those who are basically faceless masses are ultimately inconsequential.
<ul><li> In the larger <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinzaBanshoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinzaBanshoSeries">Shinza Bansho Series</a></em> of which <em>Dies Irae</em> is part of there is Mirtha, The First Heaven, who took this trope to its logical conclusion by making it into a universal law. She believed herself to be the ultimate justice and thus, anyone who followed her where good and anyone else was evil. Thus her law made this a universal and objective truth. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the era under her rule was just one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> between the two sides of Good and Evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">neither of which really fit the labels</a>.

<ul><li> This trope runs so rampant in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GoAnimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GoAnimate">Go Animate</a> "X Gets Grounded" videos, it would probably be easier to list grounded videos where this trope <em>isn't</em> in effect in some way. Generally speaking, though, if the main character of a grounded video is a designated troublemaker or a "baby show character" (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a>) and does something horrible or stupid, this is portrayed as wrong and the troublemaker will get grounded. However, if a main character of a grounded video <em>isn't</em> a troublemaker/baby show character does the same exact thing to a trouble-maker/baby show character (whether in retaliation to a trouble-maker's wrong-doings, as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Punishment Day</a>, or even just because they don't like the trouble-maker/baby show character), this is portrayed as justified or as a winning moment for the "good" character, who will subsequently be rewarded for stooping down to the trouble-maker's level.

<ul><li> The protagonists of <em>Kit n Kay Boodle</em> are always right and everything they do is morally righteous and correct behavior, no matter what they're doing to whom, because their motives are supposedly pure and for the greater good. This includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raping someone with the mind of a child, because she's a brat</span>, and framing her lawyers for the crime when they try to rescue her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeastICouldDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeastICouldDo">Least I Could Do</a></em>:
<ul><li> Protagonist Rayne gets away with being insanely rude, selfish, insulting, etc. because, well, it's him. In earlier strips his friends would give back about as good as they got, but in more recent years Rayne is the only one allowed to look good in the end. The <em>modus operandi</em> of late involves Rayne doing something mean or selfish to his friends for 90% of the storyline, then taking the last 10% to do something that magically makes everyone forgive him, whether it's honestly nice or just him cleaning up the mess he got them into in the first place. Not helping matters at all is the fact that Rayne is pretty well an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> for Ryan Sohmer.
</li><li> One of the more extreme examples is when Rayne finds a homeless orphan and starts using him as an ill-defined personal assistant/slave/plaything, often verging on abuse at the very least. At one point, he gets called out on it. His reaction is one of indignation, and he points out how he is saving the kid from a life on the street, and how he is actually the child's legal guardian. The accuser (an attractive woman, of course) backs down, saying something to the effect "I'm sorry for assuming the worst". The comic (and the accuser) completely ignores/forgets that such behaviour towards someone entirely dependent on you is still very much abusive, and paying money for someone's living doesn't render their basic dignity moot. If anything, the boy is in no position to protest for fear that he might actually have nothing to eat if he gets kicked out. (Never mind that "I may treat you badly, but you'll be worse off without me" is a tactic used by <strong>real life abusers</strong>.) Arguably, switching from the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a> to a weak attempt at treating the situation realistic and justifying Rayne's behaviour makes it worse, by claiming the situation is a-OK rather than dismissing it as a comedic, unrealistic situation.
</li><li> The possibly insane homeless older guy Rayne does basically the same thing to is played more for laughs, seeing as how the character looks almost exactly like artist Lar de Souza's self-portrait.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
<ul><li> In general, this trope is shown to be a direct consequence of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse">RPG-Mechanics Verse</a>; the protagonists (and any other good-aligned adventuring parties in general) can slaughter hundreds of sapient foes without losing their alignments by reframing the narrative to make it look like they were <em>trying</em> to be heroically-good. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0975.html">Or looking cool while doing it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</div><ul><li> Miko Miyazaki was intended to be an intentional exploration of this: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> paladin and also one of the protagonists' main antagonists. She is shown to be <em>slightly</em> more reasonable as long as none of them are in the room with her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Well, up until the point where she ends up killing an innocent old man over her own misgivings and continues to insist it was all according to some greater plan her gods had for her.</span>
</li><li> Conversely, Redcloak's motivation for the inverted trope - Villain Protagonist Centered Immorality - stems from the realization that a band of roving paladins can use their Duty to eliminate all threats to Azure City to justify killing an entire nearby village of women and children who happen to have the unfortunate ability to connect to an evil god, even if they never intended to be the one person who could use it their entire lives. He uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">Then Let Me Be Evil</a> to justify his crippling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a> character flaw and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moments, which are clearly a combination of his own fault and the influence of his spiteful, neglectful god.
</li><li> Also the source of the Trope Quote. Elan is happy that Enor and Ganji (who are antagonists) are safe over the literally dozens of dead guards, and Tarquin's only complaint is that the latter are expensive to replace.
</li><li> Generally averted due to the universe's strict laws defining Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos — if you are a dick, you are seen as evil, and if you try to be good, then you are good. The afterlife in general judges souls based on how they saw themselves and the will behind their choices, instead of the actual consequences of their actions. Slightly played straight in terms of Belkar, who generally gets a pass on murdering innocent civilians — although, as Roy points out, the best that can be done for Belkar is just pointing him in the right direction <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the Deva assigned to his after-death paperwork does concede that Belkar's evil is much less than what it would be without Roy's direction</span>.

Although he was really nothing more than a friendly, decent guy (if somewhat self-centered) he was the "villain" of the strip, and Cole's "nemesis." His "crime" was nothing more than being more successful than Cole.

Superman-expy Alison sees herself as a literal Social Justice Warrior, ready to battle all the problems of the world with her fists.

He never shows any remorse for his actions, and indeed seems quite content in a later episode to let the Earth get destroyed when he can easily save it. He has gotten better though. It helps that he was already an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> to begin with.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> miniseries falls into this trope when the turtles steal Baxter Stockman's van and take over his laboratory for no reason other than that he's a bad guy. This justification gets flimsier still when you consider that all Baxter did was collaborate with a mysterious individual who wanted to mass-produce his rat-catching robot prototype. Not questioning what this army of robots was for was irresponsible, but it doesn't make Baxter a serious criminal.
</li><li> Applied in a big way in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> cartoon, as noted most obviously in the turtles' treatment of Karai, Hun, and the Shredder. While all three characters have led <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">crime syndicates</a> and have ruined countless off-screen lives, the turtles' treatment of them varies wildly. The Shredder, as Hamato Yoshi's killer, becomes a kill-on-sight villain whenever he threatens the world. Hun, who is openly antagonistic against the turtles but has yet to do any real damage, is dealt with ambivalence—if he's killed, fine, but they won't go out of their way to do so. On the other hand, sometimes-ally Karai—who has tried to kill the turtles on more than one occasion and was perfectly willing to allow her father to commit interstellar genocide—wound up being invited to April and Casey's wedding after her help defeating an even bigger bad. Combined with the fact that "stopping the bad guys" sometimes means "committing genocide", it's hard not to conclude that the turtles, although unquestionably heroic at times, have also committed plenty of actions that would make people go "what the hell, hero?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux">Æon Flux</a></em> subverts this <em>constantly</em>. The pilot starts out as a normal "Superspy slaughters mooks" sequence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow">then slowly shifts its focus to the final thoughts and experiences of several drugged, bleeding guards dying on the floor.</a> The episode "War" goes through no less than <em>four</em> protagonists in a matter of minutes, each alternating sides in the conflict, and several of which start by killing the previous protagonist...
</li><li> The title characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> are often just as destructive as the villains they fight, which is almost never acknowledged because, well, they're the Powerpuff Girls. Most likely the townsfolk decide that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">they're probably a better option</a> than leaving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> unchecked, but often the destruction they cause is entirely disproportional to the threat.
<ul><li> The beatings they regularly give to any criminal, ever, are almost always excessive force by an enormous margin. Mojo Jojo especially is on the receiving end of some horribly brutal treatment, and given that he's no more physically able than a regular chimpanzee it's the equivalent of Superman giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> to Lex Luthor.
</li><li> They beat the crap out of an innocent clown, who was clearly not acting out of his own malicious intentions and that it was the result of a freak accident, who had also reverted and was no longer a threat when they beat him up.
</li><li> Subverted in one episode, when the Professor and the Girls move to the town of Citysville which is far more like a real city than where they had come. While there, they manage to foil bank robbers from escaping by blowing up the bridge they were about to cross with their eye lasers. Instead of being praised like they would be in Townsville, the mayor there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">chews them out for their extreme course of action</a>, and points out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">they could have just stopped the robbers by using their flight and super strength</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">without costing the town a ridiculous sum of money</a>.
</li><li> There are many instances when a villain is either subdued or surrenders... only to be beaten to a pulp before going to jail. One example comes from Big Billy becoming a good guy temporarily only to leave the group after getting yelled at. In the end, he saves the girls' lives by thwarting a scheme against them. The girls say that while they appreciate it, he still has to go to jail for helping the Gangreen Gang which he nods in acceptance.... they then beat the snot out of him.
</li><li> One episode focuses on Buttercup going too far with this. She beats Fuzzy Lumpkins far beyond any need to, and is called out for it by her sisters and the doctors who treated Fuzzy, who is wheelchair bound with excessive injuries. The doctor blatantly states she isn't a hero for beating up someone so viciously. Unfortunately, the episode doesn't really work since Blossom and Bubbles are just as guilty and aren't subject to the same scolding. A prominent example is "Bubblevicious", where Bubbles beats up innocent citizens and a dog solely out of anger at her sisters and trying to prove she's "hardcore". She is never punished, nor does she ever show any remorse for her actions. In other words, Buttercup is only supposed to be in the wrong because she's the self-proclaimed toughest fighter while Bubbles can get away with the same (if not worse) because she's cute.
</li><li> In another episode the Professor forces them to use a giant battle mecha to fight a giant pufferfish monster and the fight totally destroys Townsville, but instead of overlooking the destruction like they usually do the whole town yells at them and demands they never use the robot again. Realising what they did the girls shift the blame onto their maker, who has the decency to be rendered speechless and leave under the towns' collective glares.
</li><li> Also given one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirlsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirlsMovie">the origin movie</a>, where the girls' first flight through Townsville causes mass destruction and makes the populace terrified of them. For what it's worth, they never cause anywhere near that level of destruction ever again unless they're actually fighting something.
</li><li> Bubbles has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">Companion Cube</a>, Octi, and we're supposed to feel sorry for her whenever it gets damaged or stolen, but Bubbles shows absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">No Sympathy</a> to Buttercup when she and Blossom found out that she had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">Security Blanket</a> and went out of their way to try and force her to get rid of it, because she shouldn't "need" it, but Bubbles is allowed to keep Octi throughout the series because...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: You're supposed to side with the titular character and Patrick, no matter what, especially when they annoy or cause injury to other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHoudini">characters because of their idiocy</a>. We are also supposed to side with SpongeBob and Patrick over the people who have a justified grudge towards them, like Squidward, such as in the episode "Bubble Buddy". We're supposed to sympathize with SpongeBob because people want to pop his "friend". The problem is that the two were causing trouble the entire episode, such as keeping a very large amount of people waiting <em>two hours to use the bathroom</em> because Bubble Buddy was "using it" and making an unreasonably complicated order at the Krusty Krab. And since the bubble currency they paid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish">Mr. Krabs</a> ceased to exist (and was never valid to begin with), they technically stole several hundred dollars' worth of food from him. Bubble Buddy even let a fish <em>die</em>; at least in the Mob's case, they didn't know Bubble Buddy was alive.
</li><li> In <em>Go Go Gophers</em>, which ran on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog">Underdog</a></em> cartoon, Colonel Kit Coyote was very much an obsessive and egotistical bully for constantly trying to get rid of the two Gopher Indians, but then again, those two did quite a few mean things to him as well in retaliation that often left him and his men injured or in the stockade, and <em>never</em> got punished for it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, Hank is almost always presented as being clearly in the right of whatever the issue of the week is while his opponents, whose only crimes most of the time was simply being a mild annoyance to Hank or disagreeing with him, are turned into strawmen.
<ul><li> The example that stands out to most fans comes in season 8's "Reborn to Be Wild". Bobby meets a group of young Christians who practice their faith in non-traditional ways (such as through skateboarding, tattoos and rock music). Hank is initially happy that Bobby is taking an interest in religion, but gets mad because he feels Bobby's doing it the wrong way. Even though the youth pastor is shown to be a good man with noble intentions, Hank is portrayed as being in the right, with even the pastor's own father siding with him. Eventually, Hank explains that he was worried Bobby would see Christianity as just another fad, like the Troll dolls and Tamogachi he abandoned after about a week, rather than a way of life. While this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">a perfectly reasonable sentiment</a>, it isn't revealed until about two minutes before the episode ends, and the entire episode expects the audience to accept it on faith that Hank is right.
</li><li> This trope is why the series finale is considered by many to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding">Esoteric Happy Ending</a>. Throughout the series, Bobby has struggled to win Hank's approval. In this episode, he finally does so — but it's because he just so happens to have finally found a hobby that Hank thinks is "appropriately manly", and it's made clear that Hank <em>still</em> hates all of the "unmanly" hobbies that Bobby has and looks down on him for them. We're supposed to support Hank for putting such restrictions on whether or not to show his son any love and respect.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope applies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> as a whole, especially their treatment of characters like Meg, Lois, and Brian. We're supposed to side with Peter because he is a protagonist. Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Meg</a> is the definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a>, we're supposed to find her abuse <em>funny.</em>
<ul><li> At the same time, the majority of the time Peter is handed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>, Lois is designated as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> and supposed to be considered of higher moral ground, despite the fact that, in later episodes at least, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Lois only has a vague margin of scruples over Peter</a>, and many of her lectures or arguments with him are full of hypocritical or self serving behaviour (perhaps the most exaggerative examples include when she <em>raped</em> him to prove how misguided his vow of abstinence was, or when she chastised him for saying he hates his kids, despite once outright advising Meg to commit suicide out of apathy for her).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Brian</a> hit on his owner's wife after Peter gave him a home. He is very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocritical</a>; he constantly acts like everyone who doesn't agree with him is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">an idiot</a>. He dates women for their bodies while claiming to be interested in their minds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuy8E7JeromeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuy8E7JeromeIsTheNewBlack">Jerome is the Brand New Black</a>" by, of all people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Quagmire</a>. Much of this is either a one-time-only thing (in the former's case), or later toned down, and he becomes more of a self-loathing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout">Jaded Washout</a>.
</li><li> Quagmire's been portrayed as a borderline or flat-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">rapist</a> consistently since the show began (keeping several "tagged" Asian women in the trunk of his car, having an automatic system in place in his house to drug visiting women unconscious, etc...), but he gets to call Brian out for the above, when he is certainly even worse.
<ul><li> Quagmire was portrayed as a hero for murdering someone. While the man was undoubtedly a total monster and was abusing his sister to no end, there are better ways to handle the situation. It wouldn't be as bad if he didn't plan to kill the guy ahead of time and it was instead something he had to do to defend himself alone.
</li><li> The aforementioned episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E3ScreamsOfSilenceTheStoryOfBrendaQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E3ScreamsOfSilenceTheStoryOfBrendaQ">Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q.</a>" could very well qualify as Protagonist-Centered Morality, especially since it aired right after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">infamous</a> "Seahorse Seashell Party." Watching those episodes back to back, it comes off like the show is saying "being an abusive monster who makes another person's life a living hell is only wrong if you're not the protagonist".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> To some degree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>. Though they get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">the shorter end of focus</a> in several episodes, the narrative seems to side with the Land of Dreams, who generally treat the Urpneys as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet">Villain Ball Magnets</a> and repel and often sadistically punish them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">trying to give them bad dreams</a> (disregarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Zordrak</a> tortures or <em>kills</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy">those that don't</a>). The fact the heroes are exceptionally pious about it helps little either. Later episodes at least tone down their retaliations and give them a more genuine provocation, though the Urpneys still aren't really any more willingly villainous than before.
</li><li> The tad-infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory">Hero Factory</a></em> special <em>Invasion from Below</em> showed signs of this, as the Heroes' actions at the end lead to the death of the entire Beast colony, including their unhatched eggs, even though it was made clear that they were a sentient species who only became aggressive when unassuming construction workers trespassed into their nest. The Heroes do make peace with them, but a slight misunderstanding (one Beast accidentally stepping on a gun) causes another fight, and the Heroes blast their nest to pieces, letting the colony fall into a lake of acid. At the end, we're supposed to cheer for their victory and the one surviving Beast egg is even presented as a dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>, when it's clearly been shown that the Beasts are not evil by nature and can be reasoned with. In a previous episode, the Heroes even contemplated enacting infanticide (after finding eggs belonging to the species of an escaped prisoner), and only decided against it for tactical reasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a>:</em>
<ul><li> One major example is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E6BoastBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E6BoastBusters">Boast Busters</a>". While Trixie does go overboard with her ego, one of the ponies who calls her out and complains is Rainbow Dash, who's not exactly the picture of modesty and humility herself. Rarity and Applejack didn't cover themselves in glory in that episode either. While they criticized Trixie for her boasting and bombast, they wasted no time trying to show up the stage magician at her own show and get the spotlight on themselves, and nothing is said about them starting the entire conflict in the first place by loudly heckling and disrupting the show the second Trixie introduced herself as "great and powerful" (which is what actually egged on Trixie's boasting to begin with, but nothing is said about that either).
</li><li> In the same episode, Twilight magically zips Spikes mouth shut. Later in <em>Magic Duel</em> (coincidentally Trixies reappearance), Trixie uses a cursor to remove Pinkies mouth. Trixies act is presented as evil, but not Twilights (in Twilight's defense, Trixie left Pinkie like that for a while), nor was Twilight's not bothering to actually restore Pinkie's mouth until the ending for the sake of a gag.
</li><li> One particularly funny example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Mane 6</a> calling out Discord for ruining the Grand Galloping Gala in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E7MakeNewFriendsButKeepDiscord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E7MakeNewFriendsButKeepDiscord">Make New Friends But Keep Discord</a>", when you consider that the spirit of chaos unleashing a nearly unstoppable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Blob Monster</a> <em>still</em> caused less collateral damage than the Mane 6 managed to cause in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E26TheBestNightEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E26TheBestNightEver">The Best Night Ever</a>" (and that Princess Celestia knowingly invited them to the event knowing they'd liven it up by completely trashing the place; it's never explicitly stated if she invited Discord for the same reason, but she does seem to get a laugh out of it).
</li><li> Trixie has yet another example, this time intentionally done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">and called out on</a>. When Twilight began mentoring the reformed villain Starlight Glimmer, she encouraged her to start making friends. She was horrified when her choice of friend wound up being Trixie, causing Twilight to attempt to break them up. Starlight (who wasn't here for either of Trixie's earlier episodes) asks what exactly about Trixie is so terrible, especially since Twilight claimed to have forgiven her at the end of her last appearance. The fact that Starlight's own crimes were far, <em>far</em> greater in scope than Trixie (who at her worst was being influenced by the Alicorn Amulet) actually causes her to have second thoughts about Twilight, and wonder how sincere her <em>own</em> forgiveness was.
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle often dips into this, and often with no justification, such as becoming so obsessed with greedily winning a prize at any cost despite scolding Rainbow Dash and Applejack for this on two separate occasions, or being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Trickster Mentor</a> by making Rainbow Dash do a job she doesn't want to do to teach her a lesson despite being thoroughly upset with Discord for doing this to her, again, on two separate occasions.
</li><li> "A Horse Shoe In" has Starlight Glimmer give a fierce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> to Trixie for expecting her to be made vice-headmare of the School of Friendships's just because she's her friend despite showing themselves unqualified and carelessly endangering students.

Dipper shows them his journal so they can team up, but it's not enough proof for them to launch a full investigation. In a last minute attempt to prove he's right, Dipper ends up summoning a horde of zombies who drag the two agents into the woods and proceed to attack the Mystery Shack. Dipper doesn't think twice about the agents, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">who managed to survive during</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>.

</li><li> Speaking of "Not What He Seems", after the agents arrest Stan, Agent Trigger is tasked with bringing the twins to child services. Mabel comes up with a plan to escape: Anger Manly Dan by writing "Sev'ral Times is overrated" on the Humvee window so he'd ram it off the road. The plan succeeds, and Trigger ends up trapped in the front seat pinned down by a tree branch. He tries to call for backup, only for Dipper to destroy his ear-microphone. The twins then leave to go prove Stan's innocence, leaving Trigger stuck in the woods with no way out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">Once again, he manages to survive off-screen</a> and nobody calls out the twins on their actions.

In particular, the last few minutes shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Earth and Mewni fused together. Despite all the humans running and screaming in fear from the monsters, all the destroyed stuff, how hard it will be for everyone to adapt to the new world, the mostly unresolved racism between monsters and regular mewans, the fact that people who have been ruled by a monarchy for their entire lives now having to coexist with countless different world governments, and that Star and Marco will never see their friends who didn't live on Mewni again, this is still treated as a good thing and a happy ending because it means Star and Marco get to stay together</span>. In other words, who cares how many billions of people have had their lives uprooted as long as our leads get to stay together?
<ul><li> While the rest of the events of the episode don't directly benefit Star as much, it is arguably a much worse case of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star's plan to save the monsters of Mewni from genocide is to destroy magic, which will kill everyone made of or dependent on magic. Since this is not limited to Mewni, that means Star will be killing millions if not billions of people and creatures across the multiverse, which is probably more then the genocide she is trying to prevent. And yet, since it will save her people and stop Mina, it is played as unambiguously right and the only option.</span> In other words, if it will save my people from genocide, it's okay to commit a far larger act of genocide.
</li></ul></li><li> Peridot's redemption arc from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> can be seen as this. When she, a Homeworld Gem, is sent to Earth to check on a massive fusion of Gem shards called the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Cluster</a></span>, the Crystal Gems immediately assume the worst and relentlessly attack her until she ends up stranded on Earth with the knowledge that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Earth is going to be destroyed</span> and that shell die if she doesnt leave. Even worse, her escape attempts are constantly thwarted by the Gems, who are still unaware of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Cluster's</span> existence. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shes eventually captured right as shes starting to panic that shell never get off Earth and loses the enhancements that shed been using all her life and is forced to be without them when shes freed by Steven. Despite her freedom, shes still stuck on Earth and is forced to work with the Crystal Gems to stop the Cluster from destroying Earth. Even after all this, however, the Gems continue to show a clear disdain towards her when she displays the prejudiced beliefs of the Gem Homeworld, despite knowing full well that shes never experienced any different way of thinking. Worse yet, even when they do eventually come to an understanding, they never once apologize for everything they put her through, simply expecting her to accept their views and not care that they constantly attacked her over what was essentially a huge misunderstanding of intentions.</span>
<ul><li> Later, in the episode Message Received, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Peridot takes a Diamond communicator from the Moon Base to contact Yellow Diamond, Steven and the Gems once again assume the worst and express how betrayed they feel, despite the previous episode showing them angrily threatening Peridot for not immediately taking their side when Homeworld's plans for Earth are displayed. They only forgive her (after attacking her AGAIN, that is) when its revealed her true intention was to try and convince Yellow Diamond to spare Earth, and then cutting ties with Homeworld when she refuses.</span> So basically, if someone doesnt agree with you or is uninformed of what you consider right, just beat it into them until they reject their original beliefs in favor of yours.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is the main problem fans have with the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Pucca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Pucca">Pucca</a></em>. The titular heroine is the quintessential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> who is madly in love with the ninja Garu and relentlessly torments him. The other characters are fully aware of how creepy Pucca can be around Garu, but never call Pucca out on her actions, writing off her unhealthy obsession with Garu as "Funny Love" even though she does some practically illegal things that would've gotten any other character arrested years ago. Her status as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> does not help her case.
</li><li> This was a consistent problem <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoonaticsUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoonaticsUnleashed">Loonatics Unleashed</a></em> had. Regardless of what was going on or the actual points anyone made, team leaders Zadavia and Ace and Lexi Bunny were always portrayed as right because they were "the heroes." On the other hand Danger Duck could be an egotistical jerk, so he was always wrong and deserved anything he got like, like Lexi giving him a "brain blast" over something like a mild insult.
<ul><li> The episode "Secrets of the Guardian Strike Sword" gives multiple examples. 1) At the beginning of the episode Ace is saved from a tight spot by a guy named Deuce. When Zadavia finds out Deuce is around she angrily tells him to get off her planet, but refuses to explain why. Because Deuce saved him before, though, Ace decides to go over Zadavia's head and let him ride along on an important mission. But Deuce turns out to be evil and just trying to win Ace's confidence to steal the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Cool Sword</a> from him, which can revive an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>. After this Zadavia finally explains her behavior: Deuce used to be a general in her army but he was obsessed with gathering glory in battle and had an insatiable desire for power, so she didn't agree to give him absolute control of her military and he deserted. If she'd just said that in the first place, Deuce probably wouldn't have gotten the sword and the danger would've been avoided, but it's brushed aside with nobody having less faith in her or questioning her judgement. 2) While trying to get the sword back, Ace is jump-kicked from behind by Deuce, and calls him out asking "Is that how you treat your friends?" In their ensuing duel, though, Ace gains the upper hand when he takes advantage of Deuce turning his back to jump-kick <em>him</em> from behind. To drive it home, that fight is supposed to prove that Ace is the "true warrior" who really deserves the legendary sword. 3) In the wrap-up, Ace asks Zadavia when she'll tell him what other powers his sword has, but she replies she'll do it when the time is right because too much knowledge is dangerous. Duck complains that too little knowledge is dangerous too, and as he does an unexplained energy beam comes from Ace's sword and zaps him. This is treated as funny and something Duck deserves for contradicting Zadavia. Even though he was basically saying that <em>knowing how to properly use a dangerous weapon is a good idea</em>. Not to mention how the whole episode probably wouldn't have happened if not for Zadavia withholding important info for no good reason, yet the show turns right around and expects the viewer to take it on faith that if she says it's not the time to talk about this, then it's not the time to talk about it.
</li><li> In "It Came From Outer Space" Rev and Lexi mess around with one of Tech's inventions that looks like a video game but actually controls some kind of orbital weapon system, and they find out they just fired real missiles at a real alien ship whose owner decides to invade the planet over this unprovoked attack. Eventually the alien warlord's driven off, his weapons destroyed, and Tech starts setting booby traps in his lab to discourage this from happening in the future. But nobody's ever really called out on how by ignoring a reasonable request from Tech ("don't play in my lab: the things in there are powerful crime-fighting weapons, not toys") and insisting on fighting it out with a vastly superior enemy over the misdeeds of one person, the Loonatics almost got the planet they're supposed to be protecting destroyed, and they're lauded for solving a serious problem they created themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>, when Wuya uses a Wu that she didn't wager, the monks and the narrative treat her as a cheater, yet, previously, when Omi challenged Dojo to a Showdown, he used two Wu's that he didn't wager, and the narrative treated him like he did something acceptable.
</li><li> "Works Out" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em> involves Ms. Frizzle competing against Mr. Sinew in an event called the Teacherathalon. When Ms. Frizzle doesn't have enough energy to win the final event, the class (who are shrunk down inside her body) devise a scheme to clean the lactic acid off of her muscles and give them a boost of oxygen, rejuvenating her enough to win the final event. We have a word for objectively giving an athlete an edge in an event via an artificial boost of oxygen in the bloodstream: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping">Blood Doping<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Ms. Frizzle didn't win due to her determination (as her good sport opponent congratulates her for), but rather for <em>cheating</em>. Of course, cheaters in other episodes (particularly Janet in "Makes A Stink", who pulls a similar stunt to win a competition), are called out for it and treated as morally wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em>: A number of viewers question how the titular Lion Guard honors the Circle of Life by stopping hungry predators from simply hunting.
<ul><li> Whenever Janja and his clan try to hunt animals, they are chased out of the Pridelands by the Lion Guard because they don't respect the Circle of Life. However, these same heroes also trespass into the Outlands multiple times to stop the hyenas from hunting animals in their own turf.
</li><li> When Makucha tries to hunt Ajabu, who he had chased all the way from the jungle and was his rightful prey, the Lion Guard stops him just because member of the Lion Guard Beshte recently befriended Ajabu.
</li><li> Even Ushari and Makuu, predators who <em>live in the Pridelands</em> have fallen victim to this once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero">Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero</a></em>: In "My Mischievous Son", Penn zaps in a world as a family man who must convince his boss to give him a promotion and Rippen zaps in as Penn's mischievous son who tries to convince Penn's boss to reassign him to Antarctica instead. When said boss shows up, he states there's another character wanting the promotion and, no matter what, the one who doesn't get the promotion will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a>. The viewers aren't explained why Penn's character must be the one to get the promotion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LesSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LesSisters">Les Sisters</a></em>: Wendy and Marine frequently cause problems for the people around them, yet when one of the antagonists does the same things as them, it's treated as despicable. Thirteen-year-old Rachel attacks seven-year-old Marine for humiliating her? Rachel is a horrible person (while Rachel can be pretty bad at times, she wasn't that bad in the episode in question). Thirteen-year-old Wendy attacks seven-year-old Loulou and throws paint on her because Loulou humiliated her in public? Loulou apparently deserved it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventuresSpringBreakSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventuresSpringBreakSpecial">Tiny Toon Adventures Spring Break Special</a></em>, in order to save themselves from being Elmyra's "Easter bunnies", Buster and Babs give her Plucky so she can abuse him. Normally when bad things happened to Plucky, he often deserved it for being a jerk and con artist. What did he do to deserve this?...nothing. All he was doing was earning money in an honest way by selling his tanning invention so he could go out on a date with a girl he met on the beach. He wasn't lying, cheating, or swindling people, and to add insult to injury, the girl ends up going out with Hamton. Not helping Buster and Babs' case is that they make jokes about the situation instead of showing concern for Plucky's well-being.
