Usually, only one character or group of characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">realizes what's going on</a>, or at least has an odd sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DejaVu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DejaVu">Déjà Vu</a>  everyone and everything else undergoes a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a>, and if not interfered with will do the exact same things every time, right down to dialogue.
</p><p>Once the character realizes this, two things happen, usually in this order:
</p><p></p><ol><li> The character starts experimenting, then playing around with the people around them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">confessing or acting on</a> their feelings for another character, telling off their boss, getting themselves killed in interesting ways, and other things, in a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>.
</li><li> The character finally gets down to the business of what's causing the loop, and finds out how to stop it, often using the information learned in all the previous iterations to make sure this one last loop goes perfectly.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A common variation is that the looper is <em>deliberately</em> repeating the time period to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> (and because they keep failing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">they repeat it again, and again, and again, and again, and...</a>) In such cases, the looper has control of the loop and can stop it at any time... if they just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">give up and accept failure</a>.
</p><p>A Groundhog Day Loop episode can often be identified by the presence of several odd little events that are given full camera focus, yet don't have any apparent significance or relation to anything else. These are, of course, the events that will later be replayed in exactly the same order to emphasize that the day is, in fact, repeating in every particular. (Almost invariably, the looping character will at some point demonstrate his or her "prescience" by offhandedly predicting these events one after another.)

However, it has several limitations: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Bites the Dust" has to first bind to a specific target, who is the only person fully aware of the looping time (thus forcing Kira to realize time is looping with each iteration himself). Second, Kira can't use Killer Queen while "Bites the Dust" is activated, meaning he has to recall it and end the loop should he be forced into a situation where he needs it (like being attacked by another Stand User). Third, if Kira ends the current loop before anyone's time is up and they explode, their deaths are canceled and avoided. Fourth and most critically, people <em>only</em> explode if they learn his identity whether directly or indirectly via the person he attached "Bites the Dust" to, so if he's tricked into revealing his <em>own identity</em>, "Bites the Dust" won't activate.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops">The Infinite Loops</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fic 'verse is a fairly well-developed genre that covers a wide variety of series, with some of the most well-known being centered on the universes of <em>Naruto</em>, <em>Harry Potter</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheDisneyLoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheDisneyLoops">Disney</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMLPLoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMLPLoops">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePokemonLoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePokemonLoops">Pokémon</a></em>. The backstory of this shared universe is that something happened to the multiverse-controlling supercomputer of Yggdrasil in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> universe, causing every universe to begin "skipping" like a record, with the goddesses trying to fix things in the background. Each universe that is looping (and more and more start to loop) will have an "Anchor" to keep them stable, this anchor being a single individual who loops more than anyone else and is always "awake" in the loops, remembering everything. But those they have close connections to will eventually start looping as well. The loopers retain memories (and usually powers and even items) from previous loops, with a loop usually stretching from a significant early event within that series to their eventual death. Most of these fics take a comedic route, wherein the characters spend most of the time messing around with canon, especially when they learn that fixing the loop is completely out of their hands. What if we try beating the villain with a surprise party? Or just refuse to save the world and watch movies instead? And some loops are oddly non-standard from the start, with characters switching places, turning into other creatures, or crossing over with a completely different series.
</li><li> When it isn't being silly fun, the genre also looks at some of the negative consequences of looping through time. The most prevalent example is what is known as "Sakura Syndrome," named after Sakura from the Naruto universe, where a looper simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">cannot</a></em> adjust to the new nature of their reality and goes completely insane. There's also a restriction against having children in the loops, with the Goddesses going out of their way to meddle in the loopers lives to prevent this. The obvious reason being that said child will just cease to be as soon as the loop is done, and that's unneeded psychological stress for the parent.
</li><li> In one notable instance, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em> universe itself started looping. Phil would Awaken the day before the infamous day; if he did everything exactly perfect, he got a third day before looping again. This went on for quite a while before anyone noticed the glitch—his universe was never supposed to start looping at all. The Admins patch things so that he'll spend most of his time in variants and other longer loops, unlike most universes, where baseline is by far the most common.

At one point, he <em>thinks</em> he's pulled it off... but he has everything so rigidly planned and nailed down that nobody, not even him, has any real fun.

The three live-action film adaptations are:
<ul><li> 1983 film: The first film adaptation was a big hit in Japan, where it was the second highest-grossing Japanese film of the year. The film's success led to the trope becoming widespread in Japanese popular culture, appearing in numerous Japanese fictional works since the 1980s, especially in anime and manga.
</li><li> 1997 and 2010 films: These adaptations were moderately successful. However, they were not as successful as the 1983 film and the 2006 anime film.

One thing not noticed by most people is just <em>how long</em> the time loop goes on for  Phil (Murray) has time to memorize every book in town, learn the complete backstory of every <em>person</em> in town, learn to speak French, become an accomplished pianist and sculptor, and go from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">a self-centered ass to universally beloved...</a> all this with only 24-hour increments to work with before everything resets to square one again.

They eat the same food, go to the same town meeting, go on the same datesby the time of the story, they have been doing this for years on end without realizing it.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeMachineSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeMachineSeries">Time Machine</a></em> gamebook series, there exist "rules of time travel"; supposedly, if you break them you're in danger of being caught in a time loop. You get the opportunity to break such a rule in one of the books, and all it does is to send you back to page one. Also note that since bad choices make you re-read pages you've read already, the protagonist technically falls into a few short loops (with two or three iterations, tops) on his every adventure. (Since some of them involve arduous weeks- or even months-long trips, it's probably not pleasant...)
</li><li> In Alex Scarrow's <em>Time Riders</em>, the station from which the heroes monitor time is a railway arch under the Williamsburg Bridge, New York, on a GDL of the 10th and 11th of September, 2001. This was done intentionally; In the wake of 9-11, no-one would pay them any mind, or at least, would forget about them completely. Thus, the heroes' presence would never contaminate the future in any significant way.
</li><li> In the book <em>11 Birthdays</em>, the heroine, Amanda, relives her eleventh birthday over and over again, along with her ex-best-friend, Leo (also his eleventh birthday). One of the things about this loop is that they realize Amanda still has blisters from some uncomfortable shoes worn the last cycle, so their bodies and anything they keep on themselves remains. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Then they quickly realize that this means</a> <em>they will keep aging in the loop.</em>
</li><li> This is weaponized in <em>A World of Wonder</em>. The maximum penalty in Wonderland is to be "given pause," and forced to live your last hours of freedom over and over until the sentence is up.
</li><li> In the book <em>Ctrl-Z</em>, the protagonist, Alex, has a computer that resets time a certain amount if you press Ctrl-Z. The protagonist's friend Callum knows about it, but only Alex has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a>. So in one story arc, Callum accidentally hits his father in the foot with a dart, so he rushes over to Alex's house to press Ctrl-Z, and finds himself back at his house before he threw the dart...but since he has no memory of what happened he does the same thing, and presses Ctrl-Z over and over, leaving Alex trying to figure out why time is resetting every few minutes.
</li><li> F. M. Busby wrote a series of short stories which ran on this; the deuteragonist invented a "backspacer" which reset the world to a previous state, and often used it to rerun days until a variation occurred which didn't include some undesirable event, such as the start of World War 3. The protagonist was once allowed to use the device himself, and thereafter had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a>.

To prevent him from "cheating", the protagonist cannot remember the exact circumstances from dream to dream (enemy force composition and direction, et cetera), but he can and does learn general tactical lessons.

A new society has emerged that tries to solve such problems as how to punish criminals and how to provide incentives for people to still perform such jobs as are still necessary. Oh, and there's rumours of what happens if you manage to stay awake for long enough to make it into the Neverday, the next day that most people never see...

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> There was a Straight-To-TV documentary about (natural) disasters following a scientists life that plays with this trope. He of course is stuck in a loop, but he doesn't actually remember it, "nature" does though. He is trying to get to work, but one thing is always different from the previous loop, causing him to die (from small things such as getting electrocuted because of lighting to big things such as a sudden tornado or tsunami hitting the city) with the narrator at one point cheerfully implying that "the world" doesn't seem to want him to reach his workplace. With each loop he gets closer to work though, only to finally reach it at the end. It is then revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is a scientist working on creating a black hole. He succeeds in doing so and it sucks him and everything up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Which is the ''cause''</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>, with the documentary ending as he dies at the very beginning again, revealing that "the world" is trying to kill him permanently to try stopping the loop.</span>

Frank went back over the events several times, finally calling Dr. Ballard just before the reset point and telling him NOT to do the fix they had discussed, because Olga had just been killed and he wanted to do it again and save her.

However, time itself is conscious and <em>needs</em> Katarina's work to exist, so when Cassandra kills Young!Katarina, she and Cole find themselves starting over back at the point they arrived in the past in. And, no matter what they do in each loop — saving Hannah's life, even avoiding doing anything at all — it keeps resetting. Ultimately, they find that the proper way out is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to fake Hannah's death, then get her to someplace where she can be saved and raised in secret; this gives Young!Katarina the drive to invent time travel, and the reveal that Hannah's still alive gives Old!Katarina a renewed sense of hope.</span>

Unusually, the episode starts after many loops have <em>already</em> happened, but Daisy doesn't remember them because even though she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a>, she loses it when she dies. Which she has done <em>fourteen times</em>. The only other person who remembers the loops is LMD Coulson, who starts every loop powered down, so he only remembers the loops were Daisy wakes him up. Also, even though every loop is the same, every loop <em>also</em> brings them closer to the event horizon of a time vortex, which means that they are still on a timer.

By the time they get there, he's forgotten his name and the simple fact that there is anything outside the rig. Worse, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">Year Inside, Hour Outside</a> situation; when Tyrone pops out for thirty seconds and then pops back in, Tandy has already gone through at least two hundred loops, meaning Ivan Hess has been trapped for subjectively <em>eight thousand years</em>.

Eventually, two other characters are also trapped in the loop, which helps them work out what's causing it. In a deviation from the typical pattern, the episode starts after Three has already experienced several dozen iterations of the day. As a result, he is already in the middle of both exploring the possibilities the loop offers and looking for a way out. Interestingly, when the Android attempts to fix it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by recalibrating the clock thing that the looping characters touched, she ends up randomly jumping to points in time outside the loop, and just destroys it when she comes back to when she started.</span>

His injuries carry over from one repeat to the next. Also, "psychological breakthroughs" were also apparently carried across. I.e., if someone had made an exceptional hard choice or had an epiphany, they would actually alter their behavior the next loop, and all subsequent loops, with no outside interference. This mostly keeps the protagonist from having to solve everyone's problems every day, but sometimes ends up making things worse for him when someone doesn't do something he expects.

<ul><li> Unusually, time was very much <em>not</em> on Jack's side in this episode. The time loop was unstable and every time it happened Jack arrived in the past with worse and worse physical injuries caused by the backlash.

Joshua is punished by being trapped in a quantum pocket he calls a gulag. It's essentially a computer simulation where Joshua has less than an hour to stop the Gua from destroying Earth in a scenario where the invasion failed, and where human authorities kill all Gua on sight. The simulation is designed to always end in failure, and always resets to the same point after Joshua's death or Earth's destruction with Joshua's memory also resetting. The loop works perfectly for countless cycles until Cade finds the gulag and enters it, also becoming trapped by the loop. However, the presence of two people causes the system to glitch and occasionally show echoes from previous loops that, eventually, help Joshua and Cade figure out a way to break out of the loop. Things get even more complicated when Cain (another Gua using a husk identical to Joshua's) follows Cade into the gulag and tries to restore the loop to normal. After Cade and Joshua manage to stop the Gua superweapon, they are kicked out of the quantum pocket, while Cain remains there as the new prisoner, with the scenario slightly modified to suit him (he has to keep trying to catch Cade and fail every time).

<ul><li> The episode "Window of Opportunity". In the episode, the term "Groundhog Day" is used at one point in a partial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> that implies the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">aware of the film and its premise</a>, even though the similarity was not actually discussed within the episode. When the episode was originally mooted, apparently one of the writers worried that they would be seen as ripping off "Cause and Effect" (see below), to which another retorted "we're not, we're ripping off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em>." Only O'Neill and Teal'c remember the events of previous loops — every 10 hours — and have to learn Latin in order to figure out how to stop the loops. In a slight variation it turns out the device causing this affects 14 worlds at once. Due to time running normally everywhere else the rest of the galaxy was out of sync for the duration of the time loops. When a character wonders how long they had been stuck in the loops it is mentioned that one of Earth's off-world allies had been trying to contact the SGC for "three months" — they don't try to communicate all that often so who knows how long the loop was going on before they called the first time. At one point they turn to Daniel in the hope of him helping translating the writing on the device causing this, but this is so slow that the loop happens before he can finish. Only for Daniel to start taking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake">Double Take</a> when O'Neill "updates" Daniel on what he's done in the previous loops so the translation can go faster.

</div></li><li> Also used (although much less humorously) in the episode "Gamekeeper", where Daniel and Jack (the others were immune because they had naquada in their blood and the writers couldn't think up an appropriately angsty backstory for them... yet) had to repeat a specific day/moment of their lives over and over. For Jack it was a particular covert op in his pre-Stargate days gone wrong, for Daniel it was his parents' deaths. When it's revealed that they are basically being used as entertainment for a bunch of bored aliens, Daniel and Jack independently choose not to participate as they realize they can't <em>actually</em> change things.

This is an example that predates the film; "Cause and Effect" aired March 23, 1992, while Groundhog Day premiered February 12, 1993.
<ul><li> Some airings of the episode also looped the commercial breaks; you've got to wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">how much money</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">the station was giving up to do that</a>...
</li><li> None of the characters retained full memory from loop to loop. It was only over time that various members of the crew started to feel like the day was a little too familiar. Having one character (or a few characters) be aware of the loop was a part of the trope that was later popularized by Groundhog Day and is now a standard part of it.
</li><li> Note that the loop was only internal. In other words, the universe around the <em>Enterprise</em> and the <em>Bozeman</em> kept moving while they looped (The <em>D</em> was stuck for 17 and a half days, the <em>Bozeman</em> dated from when they had those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">funky uniform jackets</a>).
</li><li> "Cause and Effect" also reused as little footage as possible during the loops; each iteration had to be shot slightly differently, in order to make it more visually interesting. A lot of shows would later reuse shots where possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">in order to save money</a>.

It wanted to feed on her energy, but it could only do so if she was dead and it lacked the ability to kill her outright, so it created scenarios with the intention that she would give up and accept death. Because she remained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">Defiant to the End</a> every time, the creature kept having to create new scenarios to induce her to give up.

The only one (besides Mudd himself) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a> is Stamets, thanks to injecting himself with "tardigrade" DNA a few episodes prior.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> trigger is Dean's death. When Sam tries to explain, Dean responds, "like <em>Groundhog Day</em>." Every. Single. Time. It's entirely likely the loop repeated roughly several thousand times, when asked, Sam says that he lost count after "about a hundred and fifteen". And, as we see in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMontage">Death Montage</a>, Dean's deaths become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">exponentially more comical</a>. Sam's efforts to save Dean reach a level of paranoia and desperation that causes him to accidentally directly kill Dean himself at <em>least</em> once. And <em>indirectly</em> many more times.
<ul><li> The kicker? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Trickster is "preparing" Sam for Dean's untimely death in the season finale so he doesn't go off the rails. The Trickster's goal—to teach Sam that "you Winchester boys are so eager to die for each other—and the thing is, the bad guys know it too"—was thoroughly ignored and sidestepped by Sam, who instead learned just how much life without Dean would suck</span>.
</li><li> The second montage shows Sam becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">death-seeking</a> recluse, hunting <em>anything</em> in his path, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">slipping where morals are concerned</a>, and generally appearing to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">crossed a horizon</a>.

</li><li> There is also an inversion of the normal loop in Tru's nemesis Jack, whose "calling" is to relive the same days that Tru does, but ensure that things play out as fated—the same way they did the first time.

The game is a bit vague on the specifics of <em>how</em> the loop actually works, but in general that's how it goes. Most of the villains have figured out the loop and are banking on trying to end it with their victory this time around. The heroes have no clue and just fight on hoping that if they beat Chaos the war will end and they can go home.

However, the twist is that they are unable to make the necessary changes, thus they have to "act" their parts, knowing all too well how it'll end, while being aware of the constant loop. The player has to go around the castle and do whatever he can to break the cycle by finding the cause of each character's failure (usually an item the character needs or that should be destroyed). The arrogant mage ran out of mana, so you have to make sure he gets a dagger that will let him replenish it, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp">Varla Stone</a>. One knight was too worried about his lover (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip">actually a doll</a>), so you have to either plant the doll on one of the invaders or destroy it to inspire him to fight out of valor or revenge (simply giving him the doll causes him to retreat to put it somewhere safe). The archer ran out of arrows because the quartermaster was a miserly bastard about giving out proper equipment, so you need to steal some arrows from his armory and give them to the archer. You then have to take the place of the Castle's count, who was too cowardly to join the battle himself, so that the last invader can be slain and the cycle can be broken.

The Warriors of Light go back in time after defeating the Four Fiends, and die at Chaos's hand. Chaos sends the Four Fiends of the past forward in time to destroy the world. The Four Fiends start to destroy the world, causing the Warriors of Light to start adventuring. Loop repeats. During one of the cycles, the Warriors of Light become strong enough to defeat Chaos, bringing an end to the cycle. If Garland kills them in the present or the Warriors of Light kill Chaos in the past, the loop breaks. Only Garland appears to know this is the case.

Upon reaching the final boss, if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again. When the final boss is defeated for the first time, using the cross weapon, the player is informed that the battle was "a trap devised by Satan".

The game takes place over the course of a single repeating Monday (Tuesday in the sequel) and the player can choose which character's route they want to spend the day following. If you manage to complete the route, the character gives you an item which is necessary to complete certain other characters' routes.

In the true ending, the loop is seemingly broken and events resolved. In the remake <em>Siren Blood Curse</em> it is more direct, with one character literally rewinding time. Only that character <em>knows</em> about it, but all other characters have deja vu's and in general realize that something is wrong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game ends with one character ending up in a time loop hell where he will forever fight while another character sends a letter into the past to start the time loop <em>again</em> since he wasn't satisfied with how it ended, dooming everyone to forever be stuck.</span>

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask">The Mask</a></em> has Stanley Ipkiss trapped in a loop of a few hours by time-manipulating villainess Amelia Chronos. After the first few loops, he starts running to his apartment and getting the Mask on in order to hunt for her. Eventually, he discovers it's because of a watch-like device on his arm. The villainess is using the loops to put herself in a different spot each time, forming a geomantric array that will let her control time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During their final battle, the Mask gets the device off of himself, resets it, and slaps it on her. Then he drops a grandfather clock on her face. The loop was changed to a few seconds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">so it happens over and over and over...</a> When the villainess reappears later, she reveals that subjectively, it took a <em>thousand years</em> for her to get out.</span>

<ul><li> In episode "Bloom and Gloom", Apple Bloom is caught in a nightmare sequence where she keeps waking up with a new cutie mark, goes to breakfast and has her sister Applejack react to it with surprise.
</li><li> In "The Cutie Re-Mark" two-parter, the time loops Twilight, Spike and Starlight are stuck in resemble this trope the most rather than other type of temporal travel. They never encounter themselves in the past, despite using the spell several times; instead they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">always arrive before the race between Rainbow Dash and the bullies, and Starlight can interrupt it in several different manners, while Twilight tries various tactics to stop her. It also shares the common element of finding the "right" way to stop it, in this case convincing Starlight to renounce her revenge</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepperAnn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepperAnn">Pepper Ann</a></em> episode "T.G.I.F.", where the titular character fakes sick in order to avoid a history test she didn't study for. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The loop stops happening when she finally takes the test, but when circumstances make it look like it's still repeating, she reaches her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">Rage Breaking Point</a> and snaps at everyone. Only then does she realize the loop ended and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends">she has to make amends</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossingTheBurntBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossingTheBurntBridge">with everyone she yelled at</a>. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">a new loop ensues after that</a>.</span>

Eventually, the machine takes its toll on the space-time continuum and starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret Goning</a> things and sending them to an empty version of Danville, which the characters must then escape from.
</li><li> Happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> episode"Jet's Time Machine", where the kids go back in time to watch a meteor shower that they missed, but are stuck in an endless loop and keep missing the meteor shower. However, once they correct their mistakes, they break out of the loop and are able to watch the meteor shower.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoliePolieOlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoliePolieOlie">Rolie Polie Olie</a></em> had Olie trying to clean up the garage. Unfortunately, while he did attempt to do so, it always fell apart, falling on a device that his father was working on that resets time, sticking him in a time loop.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rollbots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rollbots">Rollbots</a></em> episode "Crontab Trouble", a renegade Tensai named Reboot teams up with Vertex and attempts to put the city into stasis using the Crontab, a device that distorts time. Spin intervenes, of course, and Reboot uses the Crontab to reset the whole thing by about five minutes. Spin starts to catch on to the time loop, and explains it to the others as he gradually figures it out (Daso also seems to know what's going on). No one else remembers the events, not even Captain Pounder, who sees concrete proof of Vertex's true identity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom">Ruby Gloom</a></em> has an episode where Ruby is in charge of the Gloomsville World's Fair. The day doesn't stop repeating until the World's Fair goes right. Played with when Ruby forgets something she was going to say and leaves to take a short nap in order to remember. No one remembers her leaving.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em> episode "The Birthday Wish", Sofia's birthday ends up going not so great like she intended, and wishes to relive her birthday and make it a good one. Her friend Ruby's fairy godmother Tizzy grants the wish — she is now forced to relive the exact same day over and over until she has a "truly, happy birthday". After 37 tries, she finally learns to look on the bright side and have fun, which ends the loop.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> episode "Hedgehog Day" revolves around Dr. Eggman attempting to escape a time loop he inadvertently caused during a battle with Sonic and his friends.

<ul><li> In "Mathmagic", Star tries to get out of trying to solve a problem in math class, but keeps going back in a time loop. She thinks her wand might have something to do with it, but as Omnitraxus Prime explains, it's actually because out of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate universe</a> versions of herself she's the only one who hasn't tried to solve the problem, and it's about to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">a catastrophic time paradox</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicBookOfSpells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicBookOfSpells">The Magic Book of Spells</a></em>, Star's ancestor Queen Skywynne accidentally invented a time-loop spell when trying to banish her mother and the unwanted suitor she had in tow. It took her several iterations before she realized what was going on and managed to undo it, but then she figured out how to use the spell to get the citizens of Mewni to build a new castle, fitting five years' worth of labor into a single day.

He uses them to avoid any goofing off and thus gets the best possible ending.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StickinAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StickinAround">Stickin' Around</a></em>, Stacy and Bradley keep getting sent back 15 minutes whenever gym class ends, until Bradley takes full blame for something he did instead of letting everyone share the punishment. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination">Then again</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> has "Déjà Cruise". In the episode, the girls take a vacation on the WOOHP cruise ship, which gets hijacked by bad guys and eventually ends up sinking somehow, after which the girls wake up in their room and start the loop over. They break the loop by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">learning to co-operate with their fellow agents on board instead of telling everyone to stand back while they handle it.</span> The whole thing is, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a training exercise set up by Jerry, and the entire ship is in on it.</span>

Every five minutes they repeated their actions, for an hour. A couple argues, a guy spills coffee, another guy dances through with his own boombox. To the patrons of the Starbucks, it at first looked like a really clumsy guy and a couple fighting and making back up, but by the third loop they began to realize all was not what it seemed.
</li><li> In a straightforward example, some TV channels have aired all-day marathons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em> on Groundhog Day, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/43okl9/a_british_channel_is_showing_groundhog_day_all/">Sky Movies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AMC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AMC">AMC</a>. Many TV showings of the trope-naming film also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatingAd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatingAd">air the same commercial multiple times in a row or have every break consist of the same commercials in the same order</a>.
</li><li> It's a common radio station prank to play "I Got You Babe" twice in a row in the morning on February 2 - it's the song Bill Murray always wakes up to every morning in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em>.

It states that certain systems, after a finite period of time, will return to a state close to the original state. The time elapsed until the recurrence is called the Poincaré recurrence time. Numberphile goes into detail on it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GCf29FPM4k">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The Pythagoreans of ancient Greece were notorious for their belief that the entire universe constitutes a time loop from its beginning to its end. Once, a member of their audience stood up during a public lecture and loudly exclaimed, "You are seriously suggesting that one day I will sit here another time and listen to all that crap all over again?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMulaney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMulaney">John Mulaney</a> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">famous</a> stand-up routine where he describes replicating this trope with a prank he and his friends pulled; they went into a diner, poured a lot of money into the jukebox, set it to play Whats New Pussycat by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomJones">Tom Jones</a> on repeat for <em>hours</em>, and then sat down to watch what happened. By the third or fourth replay, people in the diner starting noticing something was up. By the sixth, they were starting to get either seriously pissed or extremely confused. And just to make it worse, Mulaney and his friends had Its Not Unusual play <em>once</em> between the seventh and eighth replays to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> where it seemed like the loop had ended; Mulaney notes that when the eighth replay began, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">the entire diner nearly exploded into a riot</a>. He also noted that the diners staff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">did nothing to stop any of this until the customers begged them to unplug the machine, and never really responded to the Pussycat loop either</a>.
