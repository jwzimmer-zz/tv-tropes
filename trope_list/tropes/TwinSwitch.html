This can be to fulfill the other's responsibilities, such as a test or a date, or to experience their life in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrassIsGreener" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrassIsGreener">Grass Is Greener</a> moment.
</p><p>The advantage in having a twin  or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">Doppelgänger</a>  is that one can pretend to be the other because of their similar or identical appearance. The disadvantage to all this, however, is that the twins in question are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolarOppositeTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolarOppositeTwins">Polar Opposite Twins</a>  the wild one must pose as the book learner to successfully fool a boyfriend on a date, or the book learner has to be a party animal to fool their friends for example.
</p><p>When this situation occurs, especially in a series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> almost invariably follows.

The guy is so girly all he needs to do is swap into a school girl uniform, take off a hairpin, and change his voice a bit and he'll look/act the same way as his twin sister Yuuko. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's so good he was able to make Class C believe "Yuuko" was degrading them and got Class C to attack Class A in episode 12!</span>
<ul><li> Later in episode 3 of season 2, both Hideyoshi and Yuuko switch places, this time on purpose, and end up making things worse for each other.
</li></ul></li><li> Done tragically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because the real Ciel died at the hands of the cult, his twin brother, who summoned Sebastian Michaelis, took his name.</span>
</li><li> Taken to a an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">incredibly creepy level</a> with Hansel and Gretel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They <em>flawlessly</em> transition into the other twin's place by switching clothes, changing their voices, and even <em>swapping their personalities</em>. It gets to the point where it is impossible to tell which twin is which and what gender they are at all (it is implied that parts of their body covered by their clothes have been deformed, and that wouldn't be a good indicator).</span>
</li><li> This happens several times with Mikoto and her numerous clones in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>, both deliberately and by accident:
<ul><li> Touma mistakes Misaka 10032 for 10031 at first, before he learns of the cloning. This includes briefly thinking that 10032 is dead when he sees the corpse of 10031.
</li><li> The actions of the clones are attributed to Mikoto, for example Mikoto's teacher thinks that her student has been shooting a gun in public (Mikoto never uses guns but her clones do).
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a>, 10032 is mistaken for Mikoto, and dragged into a game of tag that Mikoto herself was late for. Mikoto lets 10032 play around, since the clone hasn't had anything resembling a normal life until then. She also does surprisingly well; her opponents use tactics designed to fight one of the most powerful espers in Academy City, not a clone with high-level military training and experience from over ten thousand battles.
</li></ul></li><li> The classic 80s shoujo <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cipher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cipher">Cipher</a></em> does this with the main character twins Siva and Cipher (real names Jake and Roy Rang). They used to be actors and models together until Siva got a scar on his forehead, and now Cipher does all the modeling and acting work under the name of Siva while Cipher is said to have quit the business.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em> has twin sisters Risa and Riku Harada pulling this off, and almost being found out.
<ul><li> Happened in a recent manga chapter: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Risa forces Rokuto's replacement-Riku to do a twin switch with her for the dance. They get found out by Daisuke realizing the one in front of him wasn't Risa (by personality) and by Rokuto because "Riku" revealed herself to be Risa.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Diece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Diece">Di[e]ce</a></em>: Like all the other counterparts, Yuki and Ruka aren't related, but they do look exactly alike. Ruka impersonates Yuki for several chapters, with the intent of murdering his friends. Sion can tell what's happened, but does nothing; by the time Kazuki figures it out, he's already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">befriended Ruka</a>. So that didn't work out as planned.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> movie, Henry accidentally grabs his sister's partner <a class="urllink" href="http://wikimon.net/Lopmon">Lopmon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> instead of his own, <a class="urllink" href="http://wikimon.net/Terriermon">Terriermon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</div></li><li> Identical characters switching places are a major plot point in two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> had Dianna Soriel and Kihel Heim periodically switching places. Dianna originally seemed to do it as a practical joke on her attendants (being Queen doesn't give you too many chances to have fun), but it ends up going a bit far when they are separated by a war. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the series, they switch again, with Kihel ruling the Moonrace while Dianna settles down in peace with Loran.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin">Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin</a></em> has a much darker take, with Casval Rem Deikun and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealRemingtonSteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealRemingtonSteele">the real Char Aznable</a>, who look identical except for their eye color. Casval, knowing the Zabi family is planning to assassinate him and correctly guessing they'll plant a bomb on the commercial space flight the boys are taking to military school, plants a gun on Char so spaceport security will detain him, then "generously" offers to switch places, thus becoming the Char we all know and love while the real one's remains are scattered through outer space.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> uses this as a very interesting way to further Shion's plot. The idea is first shown as playful, but as the plot furthers, it slowly becomes more horrific, to the point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shion uses it to fool everyone into thinking she's Mion so that she can continue her bloody rampage without her or Mion being suspected. When Keichi eventually figures part of it out, she gets him to believe that it had been <em>Mion</em> impersonating <em>Shion</em>, then murders Mion, hides her body, and locks herself in Mion's cell so the police won't realize she's the culprit until after she finishes her plans</span>.
</li><li> Though they aren't actually twins, Ui from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> pulls this in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> last</span> episode of the first season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yui caught a cold and with mere days left before their performance, everyone was getting nervous. Ui poses as Yui and steps in for Yui in their last rehearsal before the live show, but has her cover blown away when she turns out to be more in time than her sister and doesn't use the usual nicknames like Ricchan and Azu-nyan.</span> Don't worry though — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yui gets better in time for the show.</span>
<ul><li> Ui did forget to switch out her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/InsideShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/InsideShoes">indoor shoes</a> (which sport different colors for different cohorts)</span>, though surprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">none of the ladies noticed</a>.

In order to play a prank on Agnes's father, who hasn't seen either of them for years, they swap clothes and pretend to be one another — and the prank works so well that he, to take care of their further education, sends "Isa" (really Agnes) off to a convent while keeping "Agnes" (really Isa) with him in the belief that she's his real daughter. Scared of being sent to convent herself, "Agnes" keeps the bluff going, and hence nobody listens to "Isa's" attempt at telling the truth.

<ul><li> Played with in the Olsen Twins vehicle where both twins are on a train and one gets thrown off for not having a ticket. The conductor then finds the other twin and assumes she has snuck back on, refusing to believe they are twins.
</li><li> Played straight later on in the movie where one twin is meant to give a speech but is lost in New York and the other twin decides to take her place and improvise. Thankfully her sister arrives before she can truly mess up.
</li></ul></li><li> For that matter, every Olsen Twins Movie involved at least one twin switch. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItTakesTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItTakesTwo">It Takes Two</a></em> has two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">identical strangers</a> from very different social backgrounds meet and switch places.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigBusiness1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigBusiness1988">Big Business</a></em> is premised by the idea that two mothers each give birth to identical twin girls, and one twin from each set is unknowingly replaced with the other, so instead of two sets of twins, there is the same pair of sisters in two different families. One pair is raised in a small town, and the other by a rich family in New York City. The conflict comes when the rich sisters try to destroy the small town whether the other sisters live, causing the pairs to finally meet. They're frequently mistaken for and impersonate each other, aided by the fact they even have the same first names (thanks to the father of the poor twins, who has a huge family already and thus is desperate for ideas, overhearing the names the rich father gives his daughters).

Instead of switching identities, Alanna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">dresses as a boy</a> and the two switch destinations.

<ul><li> In the Little Sister book "Karen's Twin", Terri and Tammy, the twins in Karen's class, start doing this.

To make it worse, her once cruel husband, Dick, is now a helpless, brain-damaged man after coming home from a sea voyage, forcing her to have to take care of him for 11 years. You learn later in the book that he has a cousin named George that he looks exactly the same as, because their parents had been two sets of twins who married one another...
</li><li> The book series <em>Double Trouble</em> is all about this trope with twin sisters Sandi and Randi, usually with the switch being imperfect and them being found out.

The twins' parents figured it out and were utterly destroyed — the mother had a stroke over it and the father shot himself because he was unable to choose between informing the police what had happened or becoming an accessory after the fact by hiding the truth.

</li><li> In one case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNo1LadiesDetectiveAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNo1LadiesDetectiveAgency">The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</a></em>, Mma Ramotswe investigates a doctor who sometimes seems to be very competent, and sometimes seems to have no idea what he's doing. She discovers the doctor is routinely switching places with his twin brother (who definitely isn't a qualified doctor), so they can run two offices in separate cities at the same time, and make twice as much money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThinkingMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThinkingMachine">The Thinking Machine</a></em>: In "Convict #97", a convict escapes by forcing his twin brother to take his place on the cell. Van Dusen works out what has happened because the brother's have different shoe sizes.
</li><li> The <em>Miss Nelson</em> series of picture books, written by Harry Allard and illustrated by James Marshall, is about a schoolteacher named Miss Nelson who has to take time off from class and when she finds out that the kids of her class are acting up in her absence returns dressed up as a mean substitute named Viola Swamp, a black-haired, no-nonsense teacher who is known for "getting results." The book <em>Miss Nelson Has a Field Day</em> has a new twist. In this one, the school's football team, the Smedley Tornadoes, is rubbish and acting out, and Miss Nelson overhears a kid suggesting that Viola Swamp ought to coach the team because she "gets results." However, she still has her class to teach this time. How does she do it? Well, given the trope page you're at, you probably already guessed. The ending of the book shows her at home, thanking her identical twin sister Barbara for filling in for her classes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em> has a subplot about two sisters, Martha and Lettie, who are apprenticed by their mother to a sorceress and a bakery respectively, but switch places because each would prefer what the other's been given. They're not identical, but Martha concentrates on learning enough magic to disguise herself as Lettie and vice versa, and then they switch. (After the deception is revealed, the sorceress admits that the disguise never fooled her since it was based on one of her own spells, but she let it pass because she figured a girl that determined to learn should be given the chance.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Identical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Identical">Identical</a></em>, the leads are identical twins that share a wardrobe, making it easy enough for one of them to take the other's place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eventually subverted; the twins are actually the same girl with multiple personality disorder, which she developed after her twin died in a car accident and her father began sexually abusing her.</span>

<ul><li> Funnily enough, the girls have mentioned that this <em>doesn't</em> work for them in real life. They once tried it for laughs (faking the mole with mascara) and all their friends immediately recognized them.
</li><li> Actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">Inverted</a> in one episode—both sisters make plans to go out with a boy, who accidentally asked both out thinking that they were the same person. The three-person date was naturally a bit awkward.
</li><li> Subverted in another episode where one of their friends asks Tia why she's coming out of Tamera's classroom, blowing their cover. They switched so that Tia (the smart one) could take a test for Tamera.

However, they haven't used it as much now that the one twin is clearly thinner and slightly taller than the other one.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in one episode, when Zack suggested that one of them should take the place of their middle-eastern friend Sanjay at a ceremony that Sanjay didn't want to attend.

<ul><li> At one point they switch because Mary Kate doesnt want to go to tutoring lessons while Ashley has a crush on the tutor and wants to get closer to him. The gig is up once the original girl assigned fails a makeup test yet the girl he tutors shows drastic academic improvement.
</li><li> Mary-Kate invokes this after Ashley's new friend Nicole initially mixes them up, so she later pretends to be Ashley to break up their friendship because Ashley had been ditching her to spend time with Nicole.
</li></ul></li><li> Most episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePattyDukeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePattyDukeShow">The Patty Duke Show</a></em>, albeit the same actress played both twins with the help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">Scottish Accent</a>.
</li><li> Notable is how on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivAndMaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivAndMaddie">Liv and Maddie</a></em>, the titular twins pull this but it almost never works as it turns out each is terrible trying to replicate the other. Maddie can never get Liv's higher voice and fashion right and Liv is totally out of her depth trying to replicate Maddie's smarts or basketball playing.
<ul><li> Notable is the one time they tried it on their parents, it didn't fool them for a second.
</li><li> Bigger is when the girls' grandmother (played by none other than Patty Duke) came for a visit. Feeling something is off, Liv soon finds it's not their grandmother but her own twin sister as the real grandma couldn't make it so sent her twin instead. Liv actually calls out her mother on this with "you hate switches!" She agrees to keep quiet so as not to mess up Maddie being honored at school. During the ceremony, guess who enters fresh off her flight from Africa...
</li></ul></li><li> A grisly and totally non-comedic Twin Switch was the basis for an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A woman finds the body of her twin sister and knows that the hit was meant for her, so she decides to make them think they succeeded by posing as her dead sister, fooling everyone, including the murdered twin's husband and daughter. It's not until the murdered sister's bones are found and autopsied (the supposed victim had some extensive dental work that was missing from the body) that the truth begins to come out.</span>
<ul><li> In another episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one man is wrongly accused of rapes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">twin brother committed</a> (they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth">Separated at Birth</a>). His twin had discovered and framed him.</span>
</li><li> In yet another variation one half of a set of identical male twins is raised female because of a botched genital surgery. He asserts his maleness and either he or his twin kill their therapist. No way to know which what with the identical DNA.
</li></ul></li><li> Another non-comedic example: A man murders his twin, then takes over his twin's life on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></em>.

A girl has to leave her date early, so she has her twin sister take her place half-way through. It's all for nothing, because the boyfriend is too busy hitting on another girl to notice.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt">Tales from the Crypt</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeTwinGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeTwinGambit">fake</a> Twin Switch. A man (played by Joe Pesci) falls in love with a pair of beautiful twins, but they tell him that they promised each other that they'd only marry another set of twins. So he replies "But I do have a twin!", and makes up a story that he and his "twin brother" switch places every month, with one of them staying home and the other going on a business trip. So in this way he can date both twins, by doing a fake Twin Switch with himself at the end of the month. Of course, this being <em>Tales from the Crypt</em>, the twins find out eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and solve the problem with a chainsaw.</span>
</li><li> Matthew pulls this on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em> when his twin brother Andrew came to visit. Trouble is, they didn't look alike, because they really weren't twins. In fact, they weren't even <em>blood</em> brothers; Matthew was adopted but never caught on.
<ul><li> In a subversion of Matthew's normal stupidity, at the end of the episode it is revealed Matthew has known all along they weren't twins, but went with it because it is Andrew who was adopted.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the many things the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> makes extremely creepy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the episode "Pirates of the Third Reich", the Neo-Nazi killer responsible for the murder of Lady Heather's daughter killed his twin for deciding to remain an adherent to the Jewish faith, then took his place at a sleep study clinic so he could gain access to victims for concentration camp-style experimentation.</span>
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em> where the kids discover the girl they've been playing with is in fact two girls. And a season later, Ashley and Alyssa became part of the cast. Interestingly, not all of their episode appearances were together.
</li><li> On the <em>'<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurkesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurkesLaw">Burke's Law</a></em> episode "Who Killed the Movie Mogul?" loathsome movie producer Leo is murdered on set. At his funeral, everyone is shocked when his kindly brother Max shows up. He passes a lie detector test on not killing Leo but Burke notes how the near-sighted Max's glasses are clear, not actually corrective. It turns out Leo was angry Max wanted to push him out of the studio so tricked him into swapping places "like when we were kids." He then killed Max and decided to pose as him to continue running the studio.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em>, Kirsty got Laura to take her place during an exam. Unfortunately for them, Dan had seen everything.
</li><li> A set of twins from the 2002 UK <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> actually did that to their boyfriends. They took the <em>other's</em> boyfriend to the bedroom and indulged in foreplay and fondling and then swapped back and scolded them. So hot yet so wrong.
<ul><li> The Australian <em>Big Brother</em> had a set of twins pretend to be one person. One twin would spend some time in the house while the other would be in his own room with books and TV and such. At any time Big Brother felt like, they would swap over, with only a couple of minutes to update each other on what was happening in the house. They managed to keep it up for two or three weeks until one of the twins cut himself in an accident.
</li><li> The American edition did this too with Adria and Natalie. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BigBrother5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BigBrother5">season 5</a>, Project Do Not Assume, it was assumed that Cowboy and Nakomis were the twist because they turned out to be half-siblings. However; it was then revealed that someone <em>else</em> had a sibling in the house and they were pulling one of these. It was then revealed that to be Adria and Natalie, who switched places in the diary room until the reveal. There was also some brilliance from the crew, because it could have also been Diane or Drew, since they both had a twin sibling outside the house.
<ul><li> This was repeated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BigBrother17" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BigBrother17">season 17</a> with Liz and Julia as part of the BB Takeover. However, the cast was well aware of the Twin Twist.

<div class="indent"><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, it would have been worse if they'd been identical...

</li><li> Katie and Emily switched in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em>, so that Emily could sit Katie's exam while she was sat at home moping. All of the teachers were fooled, but none of their fellow students.
<ul><li> And Katie later pretended to be Emily to trick Naomi, although that was mostly over the phone.
</li><li> Actually, after watching the show for a while, it becomes almost ridiculously easy to tell them apart. They have subtly different mannerisms and dress-senses. It is almost as if they are two different people. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1smdb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1smdb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1smdb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Rather than using camera-trickery, the two are played by identical twins Kathryn and Megan Prescott</a></span>

<ul><li> This is a variation in that one twin had developed into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> because of his twin's status, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and was developing a procedure to wake him up.

</li><li> One episode of <em>The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency</em> had a case involving identical twins trying to share one dentist's degree.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> pulls this off with two women that aren't even related in "Dance with Death", thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPlasticSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPlasticSurgery">Magic Plastic Surgery</a> and an untimely death on a train (the dead woman was a wealthy heiress who had various minor criminal convictions and hired a dancer with a strong resemblance to her to pose as the heiress and deal with the obligations she didn't want to deal with, the dancer taking the opportunity when the heiress died in a train accident).
</li><li> Played a part in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> special "Black Canary"; years ago one of a pair of twins died when a trick they were practising went wrong, but it is revealed in the course of the special that the twin everyone believes died was actually the one that survived, the surviving twin taking her sister's place to spare her sister's family from the truth of her death.

</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deception">Deception</a></em> is based on the premise that Cameron and Johnny Black were the identical twin sons of a stage magician who decided to use them in his act. He hid the existence of Johnny from the public and had the twins switch places as needed. After his death, the brothers continued the deception with Cameron being the face of the act and Johnny continuing as the twin no one knew about. The public learns the truth when Johnny is framed for causing a fatal car accident and goes to prison. We later learn that the Mysterious Woman behind the frameup knew about the twin scheme and was planning on framing Cameron but got it wrong due to not knowing which brother was really which. In the season one finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Johnny knocks out Cameron and impersonates him in order to escape from prison</span>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Brie Bella</a> debuted by winning matches by disappearing under the ring after she's been beaten up for a while and then "mysteriously reappearing" completely unfatigued to pick up the win. This was revealed to be a ruse with her twin sister Nikki.
<ul><li> They frequently won matches this way even after the ruse was revealed. In one match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres">Eve Torres</a> was feeling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> and had the referee draw an X on Nikki so she couldn't switch. Ironically Brie won the match anyway.
</li><li> This backfired spectacularly when Nikki defended her Divas' title against Layla. Towards the end of the match, Nikki switched with Brie but Layla managed to pin her. Meaning Nikki lost her title without even getting pinned.
</li><li> They tried this again against the Funkadactyls, but after they won with this, a sharp-eyed referee sees through this and reverses his decision. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">They were not happy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Long before the Bella Twins, referee twin brothers Earl and Dave Hebner were part of one. At The Main Event match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">André the Giant</a> in 1988, "Dave" counted a pin on Hogan, even though his shoulders weren't on the mat. After the match, Dave and Earl (the imposter) were shown arguing with each other. The whole idea was that it was all arranged by 'The Million Dollar Man', <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase">Ted DiBiase</a> (Andre's manager for the match) as part of his scheme to become WWF Champion.
</li><li> During his WWE tenure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> was also apt to pull this with his brother Eric. This would often play out with Eric coming out first dressed as Kurt (but not removing the hood from Kurt's entrance warm-up jacket), and when his opponent would go up to approach Eric thinking it to be Kurt, it would cue an ambush from the correct Angle brother.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>, Kurt would do this trick with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> fighter Frank Trigg, who looks similar to him.

Aside from at least a 50 pound difference, one is black and the other is white.
</li><li> The Basham Brothers did this all the time too. Like many of the entries here, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingFamily">they weren't even related</a>...they just looked similar.

Jillian tried to pull the switch swapping places with Maryse...only to have the ref order her out of the ring. Not only do they not look like twins, they weren't even wearing the same outfits.
</li><li> Irish indie wrestlers Kasey and Leah Owens do this occasionally though Leah has shorter hair and they have different tattoos. If Leah ever shows up wearing hair extensions then you can bet they'll try it. Once it even worked when the two of them were wearing different outfits.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> played this straight in at least one singles match between Mike Enos and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChavoGuerreroJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChavoGuerreroJr">Chavo Guerrero Jr.</a>.

The mother sought finaincial assistance from the father, but a court-compelled DNA test can only confirm their DNA is the male parent, not which particular man is the actual father. Rather than let them off, Judge Filipe Luis Peruca chided the men for their "bad faith" actions. Judge Peruca then ordered that both men be named on the birth certificate as the child's father, both must pay 30% of Brazil's minimum wage as child assistance, roughly $60 a month, and collectively cover 50% of the child's medical and school expenses.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Judge Peruca:</strong> Its evident that the defendants, from adolescence, took advantage  and continue to take advantage!  of the fact that they are identical twins. It became clear that they used each others name to attract as many women as possible and to hide instances of betrayal in their relationships.
</div></li><li> Though they weren't actually twins, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheMarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheMarxBrothers">Harpo and Chico Marx</a> resembled each other so closely that they pulled this off on occasion. In the most memorable instance, "Harpo" appeared on the TV show <em>I've Got a Secret</em>, with the secret being that it was actually Chico in Harpo's trademark costume (the real Harpo made an appearance following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>). Not one person could tell the difference. Chico's daughter also stated at one point that during a run of their live stage show, Chico and Harpo switched roles for one performance as a kind of Easter egg for her to see if she could tell (she ended up missing the show altogether).
