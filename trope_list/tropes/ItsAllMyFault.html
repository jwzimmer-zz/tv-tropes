</li><li> "So what are you going to do about it?": This puts the emphasis on fixing the problem rather than assigning blame and offers the character a chance to redeem himself by cleaning up the mess he made.

<ul><li> At the very start the story Ichigo's family is attacked by a hollow and they are all badly injured <em>except</em> him since he was talking to/being restrained by Rukia when the hollow first attacked. He is horrified to see his little sisters bleeding out but is at a loss to understand why the hollow didn't devour their souls since Rukia told him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsWhatIDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsWhatIDo">this is what hollows</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsWhatIDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsWhatIDo">do</a></em>.

</li><li> The <em>Everything but the Rain</em> flashback arc reveals that when Masaki made the decision to save Isshin's life, her own life was nearly lost in the process, causing Isshin to have to sacrifice his shinigami powers to save her. The event not only completely ruined Ryuuken Ishida's quincy future but left him feeling like everything that had happened was entirely his fault <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Although he warned Masaki she was breaking Quincy law, he didn't physically try to stop her or interfere in her fight because he trusted her and her power. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">He bitterly regretted his decision</a>.</span>

Everyone else also says it's his fault except Jim and O'Brien. Jerks.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There's also the fact it pretty much <em>was</em> his fault, by one of his greatest character flaws: being impulsive. And yes, Jim and O'Brien <em>did</em> say it was his fault because he didn't wait for them to come back before going in to fight Brron. Everyone also blamed him because he flat out said he'd sacrifice anyone and anything to get revenge for Johan and for Freed's people, and since he was just charging ahead blindly, they all figured that meant them too.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The biggest irony? Everything that happened to Yubel was his fault too; she had willingly become a demon in order to <em>protect his immortal soul</em> and he rejected her, driving her mad.

Given that she's stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">dire situation</a>, Lucy initially plays the trope straight, but then inverts the trope by saying that she still wants to be a member of Fairy Tail as she doesn't want anyone else getting hurt because of her actions.

Be it when a supervillain escapes, when Captain Dynamo is unable to save people's lives, or her personal relationships fail, like when her relationship with her former fiance Tom falls apart because of her secret life and the fact that she could not tell him she was an agent of F.L.A.G., a U.S. government organization that deals with threats posed by superhuman beings, though she used the cover of an award-winning investigative journalist. Or when her marriage to Captain Dynamo/William Warner became strained because of his Dynamo's career as a costumed crimefighter often kept him away from home for extended periods of time, and, unknown to her, Dynamo's absences were partially due to the numerous extramarital affairs that he had. It was by Scatterbrain's convincing Warner of her need to move beyond her guilt that he was able to bring her out of the coma.

The rest of the family blame themselves as well.
<ul><li> Also, Marge says that Homer getting thrown into a U.K. jail is "partially my fault" in the episode "The Regina Monologues".
</li><li> This was also done in an earlier episode ("Bart the Lover"), where Bart said "I can't help but feel partly responsible." when he was entirely responsible for Mrs Krabapple's hurt feelings.

<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> Don't blame yourself, Ned. After all, it was me who insisted we go to the game. It was me who provoked the lethal barrage of T-shirts. It was me who parked in the ambulance zone, negating any possibility of resuscitation... But let's not play the <em>blame game</em>!
</div></li><li> Furthermore, when Homer drove Ned into moving away, he lamented "It's all somebody's fault!"
</li><li> Yet another example; after Homer refuses to pull over and let Grandpa go to the bathroom, Grandpa's kidneys burst. Homer's response? "I blame myself!" Marge's response? "We <em>all</em> blame you."
</li><li> In "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", Bart hears Lisa blaming herself for Bart running away on Thanksgiving. Homer and Marge also feel bad for being too harsh on Bart during dinner.
<div class="indent"><strong>Marge:</strong> Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves. <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> We can, and we will!

He also wrote a second one in case the beach landings failed (which was a real possibility due to the bad weather, massively complex scheme, and stout German defenses), in which he diverted blame upon himself and not the troops ("It is mine alone"). When the invasion proved successful, Eisenhower was going to toss the second letter away, but a junior officer read it and insisted it be preserved for historical value.
</li><li> An absolutely epic example by Flight Director Gene Kranz after the Apollo 1 fire:
<div class="indent">"Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, 'Dammit, stop!' I don't know what Thompson's committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find. We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job. We were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did. From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: 'Tough and Competent'. Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write 'Tough and Competent' on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control."

Lee felt this and said as much after he lost the Battle of Gettysburg after his ill-conceived Pickett's Charge was repulsed.
