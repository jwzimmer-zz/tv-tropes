</li><li> In the third chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Ed transmutes waste into gold, claiming that: <em>"If we don't get caught, we won't get caught."</em> Immediately afterward, he double-crosses his accomplice by reversing the transmutation; since the transmuted gold was a bribe of shady legality, the person he gave it to can't report Ed for swindling him without admitting his own corruption.
</li><li> In a very early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> episode, during the Chunin exams, the ninjas-in-training are given a written test with the unusual rule that they cannot be caught cheating more than four times. So, needless to say, all of the skilled students discreetly use their ninja skills to do so without getting caught. Which is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenPurposeTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenPurposeTest">the entire point</a>, as the test is absurdly difficult (Sakura is the only one who actually knew any answers) and two planted fake students were given the answers ahead of time. Naruto himself, however, unwittingly engaged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> due to the aforementioned nature of the exam. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Since he never <em>attempted</em> to cheat, he was never caught, and thus passed the exam on those grounds — even though he never even <em>tried</em> to answer one question. In addition, the rules had been laid out that an student loses points for wrong answers, <em>not</em> that they earn points for correct answers. So a blank sheet of paper counts for full credit.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Daniel J. D'Arby, user of the Osiris Stand, has this as his motto. For example, it's not <em>his</em> fault that Polnareff didn't know that, when they were betting on what meat a cat would eat first, the cat belonged to D'Arby (and thus D'Arby could choose which piece would be eaten). Though an interesting thing about Daniel is that he equally applies this to both himself and the person he plays against. To him, cheating is simply part of the game. Jotaro later uses this mantra against Daniel's brother, Terrence.
<ul><li> Amusingly, Daniel's ability to spot cheating loses out to Jotaro, who simply bluffs him with a completely unreadable poker face. Meanwhile, Jotaro beats Terrence's ability to see through bluffs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0inqs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0inqs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0inqs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His Stand lets him ask "yes or no" questions and then read the answer in his opponent's aura</span> by discreetly cheating with the aid of his grandfather Joseph.
</li></ul></li><li> This is invoked in Part 4 when Josuke challenges Rohan to a dice game, while planning on cheating using a shapeshifting (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">possible</a>) alien disguised as a pair of dice. Unfortunately, said alien turns out to be terrible at being subtle about giving Josuke good rolls, and Rohan quickly catches on that he's cheating. Fortunately, he's more angry at himself for not being able to figure out <em>how</em> Josuke is cheating, and allows him to continue on the condition that if he does figure it out, Josuke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">forfeits one of his fingers.</a>
</li><li> This is openly averted in Part 6: the Marilyn Manson Stand allows its user to freely cheat in any bet, while it will immediately recognize the opponents's cheating and attack them - and it's completely invincible while doing so. The drawback is that, unlike the D'Arby brothers's Stands, defeating the user allows the victims to retake what was stolen.

<p></p><ul><li> It's practically understood that cheating is part of the game as long as you don't get caught. And sometimes, it's still not considered cheating even if you <em>do</em> get caught if you do it in an audacious enough manner, like when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Koizumi's</a> effort in cheating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent">caused his entire body to be set ablaze.</a></span> Getting caught, however, can be fatal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As Otto Skorzony finds out when Dubya catches his tileswapping trick.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, the Foxy Pirates take this one step further. It's only cheating if the <em>referee</em> catches you, and since the referee is a member of the Foxy Pirates...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em>'s world, everything is settled by a game. Whether it's a business deal, or for the throne of a kingdom, you must win at a game. One of the divine laws of the land states that getting caught cheating is an instant loss. Protagonist Sora instantly realizes this means that cheating is fine if you don't get caught. Using magic is considered cheating, but human beings cannot detect magic, so members of magical races tend to win games against humans.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em>, he got away with it for quite a while, but Yu eventually falls under the suspicion of cheating. To make matters worse for him, Nao has him on camera cheating. He runs off in a panic, but is caught by Joujirou, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>.

When the girl calls him out on his immorality, the teacher smugly answers that in modern society, all that counts is keeping up a respectable appearence and if nobody has proof that he committed a crime, he didn't commit a crime. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately for him, Sayo was hiding nearby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape">with a recorder in her hands.</a></span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenganAsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenganAsura">Kengan Asura</a></em>'s titular Kengan battles have one restriction for the competitors: you can't bring weapons. This is enforced by a security search and pat-down before the match. Thing is, the restriction also only really applies to that pat-down; if a weapon makes it through undetected, it can be used without breaking the rules, as openly as you'd like. Technically, it's still a violation, but reporting it would imply the opponent failed to notice a cheater in the patdown stage and is therefore a fool, and it would imply the Kengan organizer responsible for the pat-down failed to do their job right and therefore call the organization into question, so it's generally accepted to never call it out.
</li><li> Invoked in a chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, where Chika is found using marked cards. She calls out this trope by name as justification for her actually being very clever, while the others quietly point out that this doesn't really apply because she <em>did</em> get caught.

<ul><li> According to the official rules, if a player lands on property owned by another player, the property owner has until the <em>second</em> player after that rolls the dice to demand rent. After that, the player gets away scot free. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">No sneaks</a>" is a popular house rule that removes this clause; if the property owner suddenly remembers the oversight later, they are still owed rent.

Amazingly, Black let this stand, and Tim Krabbé has <a class="urllink" href="http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/records/">actually listed the match as a record<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (scroll down to "greatest number of castlings"), even though that move would never fly if both sides were paying attention.

Getting caught doesn't actually stop the cheating, instead the opponent figures out what you changed by cheating, then it gets undone.

<ul><li> Unhinged, one of the joke sets for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a card called <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74306">Cheatyface,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which you're allowed to put into play for free as long as your opponent doesn't catch you doing it.
</li><li> A flare in the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CosmicEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CosmicEncounter">Cosmic Encounter</a></em> gives its owner a similar power: if you have the filch card in your hand, you can filch cards from the draw deck or discard pile, and reclaim your own destroyed ships, as long as nobody sees you do it. If you're caught, however, you have to put what you stole back, and an extra ship of yours is destroyed. The most recent remake includes this card as an optional variant.
</li><li> Steve Jackson Games' conspiracy-theory themed card game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Illuminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Illuminati">Illuminati</a></em> has a set of "cheating" rules in which almost anything goes (e.g. stealing money from the bank, misstating the powers of your cards, etc) as long as you don't get caught (if you <em>do</em> get caught, the only penalty is that you have to undo that specific cheating attempt). It is recommended that you play this version of the game only with "<em>very</em> good friends or people you will never see again."
</li><li> The entire premise of the card game known varyingly as Cheat, BS, or I Doubt It. You put down a certain number of cards in a matching set (such as two aces or three kings) face down onto a pile, declaring what they are, while everyone else watches and either leaves you be or calls you out for cheating. The idea is to get rid of all your cards in your hand before anyone else does, and it is possible to cheat by dropping down cards you didn't call (such as saying you dropped two aces when they were really a 6 and a 9). If you are called out while you cheat, you have to pick up the whole pile for cheating, but if you <em>weren't</em> cheating when they called you out, <em>they</em> have to pick the pile up. It is very much possible to cheat without anyone calling you out on it so long as you don't make it painfully obvious (such as dropping 5 queens, or a card someone else has all 4 of), and in fact, frequently required since passing is not allowed (at least in the standard version - variants that allow passing exist).
<ul><li> People are divided as to whether or not (or to what extent) you are allowed to cheat otherwise. One school of thought is that since it's the name of the game, you should cheat as much as possible by hiding cards or playing more cards than you declare so you can't be caught cheating. The other school allows only cheating in the predefined method.
</li></ul></li><li> In general, any card game that has a specific rule against cheating is really saying this trope. To catch someone cheating, you must accurately describe their cheating action, or be penalized yourself for a false accusation.
</li><li> In Euchre, there is a significant advantage to being the dealer. Normally, the deal passes to the left after each hand, but the dealer's partner (or in cutthroat, any player) may gather the cards and <em>attempt</em> to shuffle and deal. If they're caught <em>before they finish,</em> they have to pass the deck to the proper dealer, but once the deal is complete, the hand must be played.
</li><li> In UNO!, you are not allowed to play a Wild Draw Four card unless you have no cards in your hand of the color <em>OR THE NUMBER</em> of the faceup card on the table. Attempt to do so, and you won't be penalized, unless another player calls you for it. (Which they sometimes do just to look at your hand.) Even better, the challenger can be penalized for an improper challenge.
</li><li> Largely averted in modern poker, which has evolved an elaborate system of etiquette designed to prevent any player from receiving the slightest unfair advantage ("angle shooting"). Of course, this largely came about in response to poker's reputation as a game of cheats and liars, and that reputation didn't come out of nowhere....
</li><li> Certain cards in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> allow you to cheat in plain view of the other players. The rules themselves cite this. Out-and-out <em>cheating</em>, however, such as having too many cards in hand or playing a card you're not allowed to play, is not allowed: Munchkins <em>bend</em> the rules, but they don't <em>break</em> them.
</li><li> <em>Coup</em> uses this as a game mechanic, combined with bluffing. Each player has two cards, representing their abilities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nvme');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1nvme" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nvme');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the Assassin, for example, allows you to pay 3 credits to attack another player; the Contessa allows you to block an Assassination attempt; and so on</span>. However, the cards are hidden from view, and as a result, you can <em>claim</em> that your two cards are any other card in the game. If, on the other hand, you <em>claim</em> to have a card and you're called out on it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24tmy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24tmy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24tmy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"I'm going to pay 3 credits and assassinate you." "I don't believe you have an assassin, prove it."</span>, someone is going to be upset: if you can back up your claim, then the person that challenged you loses one of their cards (losing both cards means you lose the game), but if you <em>can't</em> back up your claim, <em>you</em> lose a card. This can result in standoffs, where one person initiates an action and another person blocks it by claiming they have a card: should the first person accept the block, or demand proof of the other person's claim? Good players can bluff and keep people guessing about their cards the whole game. <em>Great</em> players can claim they have <em>all five cards</em> in their two card hand and succeed on sheer audacity and grit.

When discovered, in order to cover themselves, they worked together by reflex to cover each other. The CIA test givers were so impressed that they gave them an immediate promotion to field agents. (Of course, this was a plot to throw expendable agents into the field as a diversion for more nefarious activities ... but the trope connection is solid.)

Presumably something similar happened to Kirk-Prime, but if he was being a bit less of an ass about the whole thing (and if he had some powerful friends), he might have gotten away with it. The difference may have been due to the manner in which they cheated.

Mostly done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heels</a>, but sometimes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a> against a heel who's really gone out of his way to deserve to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>. Though in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> it became increasingly common for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> faces to consistently use "heel" tactics like this as well. Wrestlers can even do this by themselves if they can get the referee to turn his back. I mean, sure, the ref looked away for two seconds and now one of the wrestlers is lying unconscious on the mat, with a steel chair next to him—but he didn't SEE it, so he can't just go blaming the only other guy in the ring, can he?
</li><li> In the 1997 Royal Rumble, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, after being eliminated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret "the Hitman" Hart</a> while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyDistractedReferee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyDistractedReferee">Easily Distracted Referee</a> wasn't looking, jumped back into the ring quickly and cleared the ring to win the Rumble.
</li><li> A subversion sometimes happens in the form of the "Dusty Finish", named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a> who used to book this sort of finish <em>all the time</em>. In this case, the trope is played straight until the match is finished and one wrestler (often the face) is declared the winner, only for a second referee to come out and inform the first referee that the face did something to cause a disqualfication (usually throwing the heel over the top rope, which was illegal at the time), causing that referee to reverse the decision. Because the <em>face</em> is usually on the losing end of the Dusty Finish, this practice is widely hated among wrestling fans. The most infamous example occurred in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AmericanWrestlingAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AmericanWrestlingAssociation">AWA</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> apparently won the title from Nick Bockwinkel, only for AWA president Stanley Blackburn to personally reverse the decision because Hogan threw Bockwinkel over the top rope. The fans nearly rioted as a result, Hogan left the AWA for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s WWF, and the rest is history.
</li><li> It can also happen taking away a title change without the win. In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> title match Dusty Rhodes had seemingly beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> for the title despite interference by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson">Arn Anderson</a> and a ref bump to Tommy Young. A second ref came out to count Rhodes pinfall, but Young overturned it saying he had been prepared to call for Flair's DQ as soon as Anderson enter the ring, but hadn't been able to.
</li><li> This also happens retroactively, usually when a title change or other "major" event happens around the time of a contract ending or injury/suspension or the like, and is explained as "going over the rules/results more closely." One of the most infamous involved the Rockers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> and Marty Janetty) defeating the Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) for the tag-team championships. Unfortunately, during the 2-out-of-3 contest, one of the ring ropes broke which lead to an ugly mess of a match that would be virtually impossible to clean up for television; between that and the then-WWF firing Neidhart shortly thereafter, the titles were given back with the explanation of an "obscure rule" involving broken ring equipment, and was <em>never even referenced</em> on TV as if the Foundation never lost them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyHeenan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyHeenan">Bobby Heenan</a> basically made his whole career with this strategy. Most noteable would be him holding down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>'s leg during the IC match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickRude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickRude">Rick Rude</a> at Wrestlemania 5.
</li><li> This is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a> managed to retain his Intercontinental title against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock">Ken Shamrock</a> at the 1998 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a>. The Rock had used a pair of brass knuckles on Shamrock when the refs back was turned, then stuffed the knuckles into <em>Shamrocks</em> trunks. When the hit wasn't enough to keep Shamrock down, Shamrock hit Rock with a belly to belly suplex and won the title.... until Rock complained to the referee that Shamrock had hit <em>him</em> with the brass knuckles and when the referee searched Shamrock he found the knuckles and reversed the decision.
</li><li> One laughable subversion of this was at Starcade 1999 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>, during a 'Master of the Powerbomb' match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy">Sid Vicious</a>. In the storyline, the match could only be won by, surprisingly, Powerbombing one's opponent. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassJawReferee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassJawReferee">referee had been bumped</a>, Vicious had powerbombed Nash and various outside interference had muddied the waters, Nash attempted to powerbomb Vicious, but for whatever reason was unable to and simply left Vicious laying in the ring. When the referee finally awakened, Nash told the official 'I stuck him!' The referee, amazingly, believed him (!) and awarded the match to Nash.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> lampshaded it (his most popular entrance music flat-out told everyone that, <em>"I lie, I cheat, I steal!"</em>), and later in his career took to inverting it. The method he used which has endured the most is to grab a chair and hit <em>the mat</em> with it while the ref's back is turned before tossing the chair to his opponent before the ref turned around and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">quickly feigned being the recipient of a brutal chairshot</a>. Despite rules stating that the ref has to <em>see</em> the chair shot happen in order to call a DQ, this worked on multiple occasions.
</li><li> After his death, other WWE wrestlers have made use of similar tactics in order to steal a win or pull the odds back into their favor. In July of 2016, for instance, Sasha Banks <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHJTnToYLJQ">did this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the <em>Women's Title belt</em> in order to put an end to Dana Brooke's interference during her match against Charlotte.

<ul><li> Most players and experts agree that a football that has been deflated to a PSI that is slightly below the pressure required by the NFL rules gives an advantage to the offense. It makes the ball easier to grip, which makes it easier for the quarterback to throw, easier for the receiver to catch, and less likely to be fumbled as the ball handler can grip the ball more tightly. That's all we're going to say about that...
</li><li> "If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying" is also a commonly acknowledged "rule" in NASCAR racing. No matter how hard NASCAR tries to discourage such an attitude, drivers and crew chiefs continue to look for creative ways to break the rules.
</li><li> Similarly, in Formula 1 it is commonly acknowledged that everybody is trying at least to interpretate the rules with creative ways to bypass their limitations while staying formally legal (although "breaking their spirit")... if not blatantly violating those rules, but with some quibbles that give the offender room for not being punished or for being able to clearing up everything. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">Ain't No Rule</a> is a common trope in this sport too, but sometimes teams also openly cheat and work to make the specific violation undetectable or too hard to prove, and know that their rivals know too and will try to catch them.
</li><li> A famous baseball player commenting, "If you're not cheating, you're not trying hard enough". It certainly seems to be a time-honored tradition in sports...
</li><li> A legendary example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">the 1986 World Cup quarterfinals</a> was the Hand of God goal. Six minutes into the second half, with the game so far scoreless, the ball had gotten loose in the penalty area and both the English goalie and Argentine player Diego Maradona were rushing at it. Diego Maradona reached the ball first and swept it into the goal <em>with his hand</em> before the goalie could stop him, and the ref didn't catch it. England is still bitter about this, while Maradona is worshiped in Argentina (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole">Not Hyperbole</a>) as a national hero.
</li><li> Professional cycling. Though, in all fairness, the biggest doping/cheating cases right now are ones from the past.
<ul><li> The Tour de France, the most challenging and most prestigious bicycle race, has a long and storied history of cheating. In the recent past, the cheating invariably involved "doping" with performance-enhancing drugs, though this has declined as drug tests have become increasingly effective at catching such drugs. But the early years of the race involved much more overt methods of cheating. The second Tour de France (in 1904) had so much cheating that it almost resulted in permanent cancellation. Multiple cyclists were disqualified for cheating, and 5th place finisher was declared the winner since everybody ahead of him was disqualified. And he had <em>also</em> cheated at least once, but for whatever reason was only given a warning. Much of the cheating was amusingly audacious (skipping sections of the race by getting rides in cars or trains), but it also included sabotage (nails were laid out in roads to cause flat tires) and even violence (masked men in a car attacking the then-leading cyclists, and fans of some cyclists threw rocks at everyone else as they passed).
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion">Rugby Union</a>, it's said that an openside flanker who doesn't get accused of cheating is not good enough.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34slv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note34slv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34slv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">an openside flanker is responsible for, among other things, winning turnovers.</span>
</li><li> Inversion: 1983's infamous "Pine Tar Game" in Major League Baseball. George Brett of the Kansas City Royals had a home run disallowed due to a rule limiting the amount of pine tar on a bat. The Royals protested, and the American League office upheld the protest and ordered the game resumed. AL President Lee MacPhail stated that the intent of the limit was to prevent more balls from being defaced by the pine tar, which would require the umpire to toss them out of play. Since the ball was knocked out of the park anyway, Brett had not violated the spirit of the rule. Sometimes, it's not cheating <em>even if</em> you get caught.
</li><li> The Baltimore Orioles of the 1890's. They pretty much stretched the rules of baseball of time like taffy. A short list of the things they did: having the ground keeping crew alter the field in various ways to enable Baltimore's batters to play "small ball," hiding a ball within the outfield grass, grabbing onto the base runner's belt, putting dirt and pebbles in shoes, throwing equipment at base runners, tripping base runners, shoving base runners, and hip checks on base runners. As others have mentioned many times, this was not considered cheating, but playing smart baseball. Their manager at the time called it "playing baseball as she was meant to be played" though John McGraw, their pugnacious 3rd baseman more truthfully called it "artful kicking." They inspired other baseball teams, even to this day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bodybuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bodybuilding">Bodybuilding</a>:
<ul><li> Bodybuilding is rife with performance enhancing drugs such as testosterone, anabolic androgenic steroids, human growth hormone, and insulin which allow competitors to pack on more muscle than would be realistically possible through diet and exercise alone. Since bodybuilders are also graded on their conditioningmeaning the shedding of fat and water-weight before a show to better reveal the texture of and separations between their musclesthey will use diuretics to get strategically dehydrated for the much-desired hard and dry look. Drugs are bodybuilding's open secret. The official position of the International Federation of Bodybuilding is that they comply with the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and they will sanction any bodybuilder who is caught using PEDs. Because of that, if a journalist or documentarian asks an active pro bodybuilder if they use such drugs, they will deny it and claim that they got their physique from only diet and supplements. Despite this, many famous former and retired bodybuilders such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and Dorian Yates have disclosed their own drug use, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of IFBB pro bodybuilders are "enhanced". The attitude throughout the Golden Era of the 60s, 70s, and 80s was, "don't ask, don't tell". Fear over the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990 caused that to be the only year in which the Mr. Olympia and Arnold Classic competitions took a serious anti-drug stance and tested their contestants for anabolics. This proved very unpopular due to Shawn Ray being stripped of his 1st place Arnold Classic title when it turned out hed failed a drug test<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4tczx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4tczx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4tczx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he'd recover from that setback by subsequently taking 3rd at the Olympia</span>, and all the physiques on the Mr. Olympia stage later that year being "off" because everyone jumped off their steroid cycles early in order to pass the testing. As it turned out, bodybuilding managed to fly under the government's radar compared to more mainstream sports such as Baseball and Professional Wrestling (The WBF, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s short-lived attempt to start a new bodybuilding organization to rival the IFBB, failed partially due to the pressure Vince felt to enforce drug testing), and as soon as the IFBB realized that they werent under serious legal scrutiny, they quietly stopped testing for anabolics. The rules on the books still say that they reserve the right to test athletes at any time for banned substances, but in practice they don't test for anything except diuretics, and when they do pop someone for diuretic use it's just because they got unlucky or weren't smart enough to not get caught. If anything, the Mass Monster Era that we've been in since the 90s has gone in the direction of increasing drug use as the size game becomes more and more competitive.
</li><li> As if all that wasn't enough, since the 90s there's been the option of "sight enhancement oils", which are substances such as Synthol that can be injected into a muscle to make it look bigger than it actually is. The most common sites for these injections are the biceps and calves. The problem is that over-use of synthol is really obvious since it can cause discoloration, unnatural muscle shape, or erasure of the "cuts" between different muscles that bodybuilders need to score well on conditioning. A bodybuilder who shows up on stage with a botched synthol injection will of course have to engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> about how the effect is merely the result of a training injury, but the attitude of many is that any bodybuilder who's skillful enough to enlarge their muscle without the telltale signs of SEO injection <em>deserves</em> to get away with it.
</li><li> Natural bodybuilding shows are supposed to be PED-free, since they actually have mandatory drug testing and their standard of size and conditioning takes into account that these guys are not realistically going to look as huge or ripped as IFBB pros. Despite this there are still shenanigans, especially because anybody who uses doping and gets away with it will be going against guys who actually <em>are</em> all-natural. It is possible to fool a polygraph test, and the commonly used urine test is not the most sensitive or accurate method. Theres also the problem that testing is only right before the competition instead of year-round, which allows a cheater to spend most of the year getting bigger through doping and then stop far enough out there won't be detectable traces left on testing day. So they may be natural on competition day, but a lot of them arent necessarily natural year-round. Some people believe the "fake natty" problem is so widespread that its making a joke out of natural bodybuilding.

Their entire <em>legal system</em> is based around this trope. As an example, in the city of Menzoberranzan if a Drow Noble House wants to eliminate another Noble House they must do it in a way that leaves no member of the eliminated house alive, since only the attacked house has the right of accusation against the attacking house, and are the only ones allowed to witness. Anyone else who happens to see the attack are merely "spectators." If even one member of the attacked house is alive to accuse the attackers, the attacking family will, according to the law, be eradicated. If no one is left alive to witness, everyone will act as if the now deceased house <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">never existed in the first place</a>, except for vaguely praising the attackers for a successful raid.

Therefore, if a player metagames blatantly (such as "I'm going to hide behind a rock, because it will give a half-cover penalty to my attacker"), the proper response for a <em>Paranoia</em> GM is to ask in character as Friend Computer: "You are red clearance, Citizen. How did you come by this knowledge?" Then wait as the other characters fall over each other to execute the errant character for treason. It's that sort of game. With five backup clones, this in practice is more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">warning to the player</a> than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">bolt of purple lightning</a>. The player-facing (red-clearance) sections of the rulebook do cheerfully suggest to players that if they're going to read the ultraviolet rules (as it is universally assumed they will), at least keep their metagaming subtle, as in <em>Paranoia</em>, part of the point of the game is trying to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught">Not Cheating Unless You Get Caught</a> on pretty much everything. On the other hand, published adventure modules, though also given the ultraviolet-clearance conceit, often have much more sincere disclaimers to players begging them to not read the adventure so as to not have the surprises spoiled for them.

<ul><li> Sparta liked this trope:
<ul><li> As a rite of passage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a>, each Spartan boy would be denied enough food to survive, forcing them to steal from the Helots. Stealing was still illegal, however, so if the boy was careless enough to get caught, he would be punished mercilessly. One story goes that a boy who stole a fox cub and hid it under his tunic got caught and denied doing anything, even as the fox woke up and started chewing his way out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Not through</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBurster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBurster">the tunic</a>.
</li><li> For soldiers, the same applied to having sex with your wife — the men lived together in barracks and were "forbidden" to go home. The idea was that if you had to break the rules to sleep with your wife, you'd take it a lot more seriously. Sparta always needed more sons.
</li></ul></li><li> Smuggling was notorious for this in the Early Modern era, to the point that the original "tea party" was in response a tariff <em>cut</em> putting American smugglers out of a job. The larger problem came from the tariff exemption granted to the East India Company, a corporation owned by the crown and nobility. Because their tea wasn't taxed, they could set up tea houses in the colonies that could undercut the Colonial tea houses and drive them out of business. While smugglers lost their jobs, they didn't generally live in the colonies full time... but the local business owners and their employees did, and their discontent led to the Boston Tea Party. It is nevertheless a historical irony that the tea dumped into the harbor was dumped because it was not taxed. Especially ironic that modern anti-tax activists named their movement after it.
</li><li> Two of the unwritten rules for special forces (read: commando) groups are "if you ain't cheating, you ain't trying", and "if you're caught cheating, maybe you're not special forces material." For example, there will usually be some point where a commando will be ordered to report to a distant base, but not given any transportation (or, for that matter, a pass to leave the base they're currently at). It's up to the special forces guy to find a way to get there — following their orders, but against military regulations.
</li><li> In the year 1000, the nation of Iceland officially converted to Christianity. While the transition was smooth and surprisingly bloodless, worshiping the old gods was still allowed as long as it was done in secret.

Special mention goes to the Japanese, who categorically denied Western rumors that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">were building forty- to fifty-thousand ton battleships</a> (when the limit was 35,000 tons). The battleships in question turned out to be the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_class_battleship">''Yamato'' class<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which weighed in at <em>65,000 tons</em>. Nobody outside Japan knew their exact weight until <em>after</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.
<ul><li> Japan was also building 8-inch gun turrets that didn't have ships to go with them, ostensibly as spare parts for their heavy cruisers. In actuality, those 15-gun light cruisers were always intended to have their 6-inchers replaced by 8-inchers as soon as Japan could get away with it, as the turret mounts were of the same size. And those cruisers were <em>also</em> already weighing in at 12,500 tons rather than the official 10,000.
</li><li> Similarly, the Italians relied heavily on outright cheating to bypass the treaty, but turned out to just not be as good at it as the Japanese. Prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, other nations' naval officials were astonished at how Italy managed to build cruisers that were a good 50% faster than comparable ships of other nations. It turned out the way Italy managed that was to send the ships on their shakedown cruises without carrying such minor items as gun turrets, thus making them come in (barely) below the 10,000 ton limit. In actual combat conditions, the added weight from actually carrying weapons meant that Italy's ships, far from the speed demons they seemed to be pre-war, were actually <em>slower</em> than their British and American counterparts.
</li><li> While not subject to the Washington Naval Treaty, Germany initially was under similar restrictions via the Treaty of Versailles. At the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, Germany was stripped of nearly their entire navy, and allowed to keep only 6 light cruisers and 6 archaic pre-Dreadnought battleships. The battleships could be replaced once they were at least 20 years old, but the replacements were restricted to 10,000 tons displacement. The intention was that Germany would be limited to coastal defense battleship like those of the Scandinavian navies, and definitely <em>not</em> commerce-raiders. Instead, Germany designed the so-called "pocket battleships", designed specifically for commerce raiding, which were basically heavy cruisers except with 11-inch guns (akin to a small battleship, but with only six guns). Oh, and their actual weight was almost 15,000 tons.
</li><li> Amusingly, all the cheating was for naught; aircraft carriers proved to be vastly more important than battleships, which played only a relatively minor role in the war. The only real battleship vs battleship engagement in the whole of World War II was pretty much pointless. And the nations which focused on aircraft carriers instead of battleships had an advantage. Incidentally, this was exactly how the Americans, the authors of the treaty, got around it.
<ul><li> Though aircraft carriers were arguably the most ballsy example of cheating to begin with, the treaty also regulated the total tonnage of carriers each navy could have and it was intended most sides would only get two or three full-sized carriers. However, there was a loophole that if they modified carriers to improve seaworthiness, they could still post them at the original tonnage. Thus, it was tradition to launch carriers in a barely seaworthy state, then subsequently improved to actually be useful. When that failed, it was custom to outright lie about tonnage. The US was able to use this to eek out enough tonnage to construct <em>five</em> additional fleet carriers on top of their planned two while Japan was able to muster four on their own planned two. Japan also tried to build a fleet of light carries (which were completely unregulated) to get around this rule, but the loophole was patched after they built one.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Some people actually believe that rules and laws in general are meaningless unless enforced, whereby breaking a rule, leaving no evidence that a rule was broken, and not getting caught in the act is as good as obeying that rule. (Unless, of course, the rule/law was put in place because of the long-term concequences of breaking it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Or for your own safety.</a>). Examples are Third World countries where laws are often similar to those in developed nations, but since law enforcement tends to be weak/corrupt, only a minority of offenders are arrested, sometimes selectively.
</li><li> If crimes are viewed as "cheating" at life, this is basically the attitude of most criminals. Especially if their motive is profit rather than revenge or just sociopathy. Not only does a thief risk going to prison, they don't get to keep what they stole, either.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7slne');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7slne" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7slne');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not that they were ever going to in the first place.</span> But there are always criminals who are undeterred by prison time and other punishment, because they expect to not get caught.
</li><li> (Unofficial) Core value number 9 of the Singapore Armed Forces: do whatever you want, but don't get caught.
</li><li> "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" basically applied this principle to the law against gays enlisting in the U.S. military. It was still illegal, but it was also against regulations to try to find out about it. Annoyingly enough, it's the "trying to find out about it" side of things that often involved more cheating.
</li><li> Riding public transit trains that use pseudo-random human-conducted fare inspections rather than fare gates without paying: Not illegal unless you get caught. Of course, you have to ask yourself: is a "free ride" worth the risk of paying tens or hundreds of times more than what you would've paid if you simply bought a ticket?
</li><li> Similarly, driving without a license. Nothing stops you from operating a motor vehicle without your license on you (whether because you misplaced it or never earned it in the first place). It's not illegal unless the cops pull you over (because you're speeding, driving unsafely, an accident victim, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Profiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Profiling">not white</a>, etc), at which point, <em>have fun</em>.
</li><li> As seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TradingPlaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TradingPlaces">Trading Places</a></em>, using misappropriated or "insider" information to invest in commodities (as opposed to the stock and bond market) was <strong>not</strong> illegal at the time, although a government courier could still get in trouble for unauthorized release of government information. In the aftermath of the 2008 recession, the law that changed this, Section 136 of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8wjpx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8wjpx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8wjpx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">also called the Dodd-Frank Act</span> was enacted in 2010, and informally known as "The Eddie Murphy Rule". The chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw">specifically referred to the film</a> when <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagensler-25">first publicly proposing the rule change.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a> <em>lives</em> by this trope and most times don't even bother with the "get caught" part. This page's opening quote is a core belief of many a modern-day Chinese citizen. A lot of laws over there exist merely as a formality, which brings on the whole gamut of cheating-related problems, ranging from the mundane such as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7xz9cf/what_makes_online_cheating_so_prevalent_in_china/">cheating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/pay-to-win-video-games-differences-between-us-and-chinese-gamers.html">paying to win<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on online games without qualms, to the very concerning, such as the country's tendency of producing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct">bootlegs</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10132391/Riot-after-Chinese-teachers-try-to-stop-pupils-cheating.html">rioting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when cheating on the national exams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">is forbidden</a>, more <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety_incidents_in_China">food scandals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> than one can shake a stick at... the list goes on. This is usually justified in that, with a population as large as China's, one literally cannot afford to get on their high horse and <em>not</em> cheat, as that usually means they would starve to death. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> tends to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;ei=7LADXPvgC9HTjgSAmY-oCg&amp;q=india+cheating&amp;oq=india+cheating&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67j0j0i10j0l2j0i10l3j0j0i10.3328.3328..3908...0.0..0.86.86.1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.tZ1H1ehLPKQ">have the same problems<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and also has a high population, which begs the question of whether or not most discussions around epidemic levels of cheating are ignoring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">Elephant in the Living Room</a>.)
