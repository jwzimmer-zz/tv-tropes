This is separate from rank although it may be implied that they're too badass for anyone to complain. Also different from a practical reason to be dressed different such as fireproof clothing for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">pyrokinetic</a> army. When somebody sympathetic is doing this and getting away with it, it's almost certainly a symptom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a>. In a non-mild military, it's a way of showing the character's contempt for regulations— probably marking them as an enormous asshole who's too connected to discipline, unless the army <em>deserves</em> contempt.
</p><p>This may also be a reason for most cop shows to center on plainclothes detectives instead of uniform officers, as even high-ranking brass on the detective side only wear uniforms under specific circumstances. On the other hand, detectives in media tend to select 'plain clothes' with enough similarities to be uniform, making them easily identifiable before they identify themselves, and justifying enough customization to reflect character traits and investigative style.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferStudentUniforms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferStudentUniforms">Transfer Student Uniforms</a>, where the character still stands out, but from wearing the uniform of a previous school or station, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> where a military uniform is impractically fancy. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform">Non-Uniform Uniform</a>, for modifications to a uniform that's still technically within the uniform's guidelines.

</p><p>Often the reason behind this is to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctiveAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctiveAppearances">Distinctive Appearances</a> for any characters of importance  in reality, the entire point of a uniform is so that everyone's equal and the same, which obviously has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy">undesirable effects</a> for a story's main characters.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara">Shugo Chara!</a></em>: Amu has one with a slightly higher skirt, a loosened tie and a black jacket and shirt combination, complete with "x" hair-clips, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">of course</a>, rather than the usual Seiyo girl's uniform, which consists of a black jumper, a relatively long skirt, and a straighter, less crooked tie. She also wears legwarmers in the same red tartan as the skirt, something everyone else lacks. The other Royal Guardians probably also qualify, as the Royal Cape seems to be the only constant (mostly).
</li><li> In spite of being employed by and holding a rank in the state military, Edward Elric in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is not required to wear a military uniform, instead traveling in a distinctive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongCoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongCoat">red coat</a>. The Amestrian military also seems to have unusually lax standards for cutting and styling hair.
<ul><li> May or may not have to do with if the alchemist in question is currently serving a literal military role. For example: Armstrong and Mustang, while they are intelligent and may do their own research, are generally shown to be involved in military operations and missions, while others such as Edward Elric and Shou Tucker don't regularly wear uniforms (at least on screen in the latter case) and typically engage more in research activities for the military rather than battle.
<ul><li> Also, would the military even have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort">teenager-sized</a> uniforms?
</li><li> You mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">tiny micro bean-sized uniforms</a>?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Roy Mustang</a> enlisted, then finished his alchemy training while a soldier. So he only became a state alchemist after joining the military. Edward Elric, like several other state alchemists, never joined the army, so he was never issued a military uniform (the confusion arises from the fact that the title of state alchemist is equivalent to major, but they aren't part of the chain of command.).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, none of the main and few of the secondary characters wear the uniforms of their villages. The closest thing to uniformity is that everyone does wear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsHeadband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsHeadband">forehead protector</a> with the symbol of their village somewhere on their body. After the timeskip Lee and Shikamaru wear the uniform's flak vest, but have customized the rest of the outfit.
<ul><li> Many adults also have custom uniforms to a degree, such as Shikaku's torn sleeves and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> of the Yondaime.
</li><li> However, when they all go off to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">battle in the Fourth Ninja War</span> everyone dons the uniform (except for Naruto, who isn't there).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Once he starts attending Fūrinkan High School, Ranma never wears a school uniform in either the manga or the anime — barring the few times his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexShifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexShifter">female form</a> wore a girl's uniform as a disguise. He only wore a uniform normally in flashbacks, when he was at his old boys-only junior high.
</li><li> Tatewaki Kunō rarely wears a school uniform, either, opting instead for his kendo outfit.
</li><li> Ukyō Kuonji wears <em>a</em> school uniform, but it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">boy's</a> uniform from her old school, not a Fūrinkan High uniform. (In the anime, she puts on the standard girl's uniform on two occasions.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>, Ryoma Echizen wears black shorts as opposed to the customary white shorts. Tooyama Kintaro also wears a leopard print tank instead of the uniform shirt.
</li><li> The Principality of Zeon in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> did not have color-coded uniforms by rank, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilots</a> did get to wear special uniforms, which usually matched their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Ace Custom</a> mecha. And each of the ruling Zabi family had their own take on a special purple uniform for formal occasions.
<ul><li> This is mentioned to be a serious problem for the Zeon side, as it basically means "individual glory &gt; teamwork" in the worst cases. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">ace pilots</a> can do what they want within limits, and this applies retroactively.
</li><li> The mostly-civilian White Base crew had a few custom uniforms too, mostly because they're handmade stopgaps.
</li></ul></li><li> It should be noted that the AEUG of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em> actually didn't have a dress code (having originated as a rebel group of former Earth Federation and Zeon soldiers, along with whatever civilian volunteers they picked up along the way), so <em>everyone</em> wore a custom uniform, no matter what it was. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Bright Noa</a> actually stood out <em>because</em> he wore his standard EFF uniform, as it happened to be what he was wearing when the <em>Argama</em> rescued him and he joined up.
<ul><li> Paptimus Scirocco, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> of <em>Zeta Gundam</em> is not officially a member of the Titans task force, and his uniform shows this off, being the Titans uniform but in white and gold rather than black and red. Two other pilots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Yazan Gable and artificial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> Rosamia Badam, also get their own unique uniforms in yellow/black and purple/red respectively. Two Federation pilots attached to the Titans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a> Lila Milla Rira and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> Buran Blutarch, also get custom uniforms (dark red and sleeveless and black/blue respectively) despite not being full-fledged Titans.
</li><li> <em>ZZ</em> starts out with most Neo Zeon forces wearing standard Zeon uniforms, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> Mashymre Cello the only one shown with any embellishments, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> Chara Soon foregoing a uniform altogether. Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda">Dragon with an Agenda</a> Glemy Toto ditches his plain uniform for a custom armored one prominently featuring his personal crest, though, custom uniforms start spreading across the officer corps like wildfire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em> trimmed down on the custom uniforms a bit for both factions. Amuro Ray and Kayra Su wear a blue variant of the standard EFF/Londo Bell uniform, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to the blue uniforms from the original series, while Chan Agi gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniformOfSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniformOfSexy">miniskirt with her uniform</a>. For Neo Zeon, Nanai Miguel eschews the standard military shirt and pants in favor of a collared shirt and tie and a knee-length skirt. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilots</a> Gyunei Guss and Rezin Schneider have the standard uniforms in their personal colors, and Quess Paraya receives a uniform in Char's red. Char himself has a custom dress uniform as well as his standard uniform.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, ZAFT uniforms are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">Color-Coded for Your Convenience</a> to differentiate between their respective wearers' ranks (like, red is for pilot aces, black is for ship captains, white is for squad commanders, etc.). However, <em>very</em> cool pilots receive a special right to use a uniform of any color, like orange or white without being a commander. Andy "Desert Tiger" Waltfeld takes advantage of this to indulge his preference for a tiger motif.
<ul><li> More subtle variations appear in the Earth Alliance uniforms. Most of them are white with greyish sides and black or greyish shoulders, but a few officers - most notably the villainous William Sutherland and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Natarle Badgiruel</a> following her promotion to captain of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Archangel</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">opposite number</a> - have black shoulders and black sides, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Archangel</a></em> is the only OMNI officer to have a uniform with red shoulders.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, Lunamaria Hawke wears the red ZAFT uniform with a very short skirt <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki">Zettai Ryouiki</a> instead of trousers. The three Extended pilots wear even further-customized versions of the lowest-rank OMNI uniforms, and Neo Roanoke, as Captain of the 81st Autonomous Mobile Group, wears a version of the OMNI officer's uniform that is dark grey and black instead of white and grey.
</li><li> Also nearly every named pilot has a custom pilot suit of some design. Rey wears a white ZAFT pilot suit for despite being a redcoat, and Heine has an Orange suit of the same color as his Prototype GOUF with a Faith emblem on it. Athrun also has a purple flight suit for some reason but it was just given to him when he rejoined Zaft with no hint that he specifically wanted it. Shinn and Luna wear the Elite pilot suits and Shinn later gets a Faith emblem on his. The only named character with a generic suit is Dearka (in <em>SEED</em> he wore the red "elite" uniform and pilot suit; his now wearing the same uniform as ordinary grunts implies that he was demoted as punishment for having defected during the previous war). On the Orb side Kira, Athrun and Cagalli have a specially colored Orb pilot suit and Mwu gets one with the same markings as his old EA Hawk suit. And Andrew Waltfeld gets a tiger striped pilot suit of undetermined design.
</li></ul></li><li> Unusually for a Gundam series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em> mostly subverts this trope throughout the first season.

<ul><li> It gets a bit looser in the second series with Graham's "Mr. Bushido" attire and the Innovator's colour coded helmets. Celestial Being also get a uniform but each member has a different colour scheme and some further customise their outfits (Ian, Lasse, Mileina, Linda).

</li><li> Apparently, Joker and Wendy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Die</a></em> are so powerful they don't need to wear uniforms while ordering people around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the anime and manga, Utena Tenjou refuses to wear the standard girls' school uniform on the ground the rules don't specify who has to wear which. However, she doesn't wear a boy's uniform either, but a modified jacket from the boys' uniform options plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWearsShortShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWearsShortShorts">red bicycle shorts</a> from <em>the gym uniform</em>. In the manga, a teacher tries to call her out on this, but Utena quotes the student handbook back at her: the only formal requirement is that she select from the list of school-approved garments. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">It doesn't say</a> that she can't combine pieces from different uniform sets, or that approved pieces can't be custom-tailored.

The uniform is a black-and-white version of the teal boys' uniform with a matching hat none of the boys wear. It may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferStudentUniforms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferStudentUniforms">her previous school's uniform</a>, but what kind of school would have fancier uniforms than friggin' Ohtori Academy? Utena's actually mistaken for a boy until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">her jacket comes open during a fight</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hokuto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em> wears a white uniform instead of the ordinary black due to him having been mistaken about the school he transferred to... He now wears it to stand out of the "normal" people (he gave Mechazawa a white uniform as a birthday gift, too). Freddie and the Gorilla don't wear uniforms either [the former dresses to reference Freddie Mercury, the latter is nude presumably because that's how gorillas usually dress], but nobody knows whether they're actually students or not.
</li><li> Seras Victoria of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> and her blue (or khaki in the manga/OAVs) uniform with that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki">crazy microskirt and black (or white in the manga/OAVs) stockings</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>:
<ul><li> Manjoume still wore his North School uniform even after he returned to Duel Academia because he considered the red uniform from the Osiris dorm humiliating.
</li><li> In contrast, Rei wears her Osiris Red jacket even when in Obelisk Blue, instead of Obelisk Blue's original girl uniform. Additionally, although no other female Osiris Red is seen in the series, her entire Osiris Red uniform after she is officially accepted into the school, is different from the standard one seen in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Online</em>.
</li><li> The exchange students (Edo, Johan, Jim, O'Brien and Amon) do not seem to wear uniforms at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden">Red Garden</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> Sailors Uranus and Neptune are the only senshi to wear short gloves rather than elbow-length ones. Given their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly">Aloof Ally</a> status, this sets them further apart from the others.
</li><li> Creator Naoko Takeuchi originally intended for all the senshi to have wildly different uniforms, including masks, but this was shot down by anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">sentaification</a> considerations. Evidence: Sailor V, Sailor Moon early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga chapters</a> (Moon had a mask for a chapter, Jupiter had a belt, etc).
</li><li> In the final arc of the Manga, all the girls receive a final power up giving them uniforms that are completely identical apart from color and hairstyle (Even the unique earrings and shoes that the second set of uniforms let them keep are now consistent, though Jupiter Venus and Chibi-Moon do get to keep the items worn in their hair), except Sailor Moon, who has an extremely large angel wings attached at her waist, replace the traditional back bow, though the wings are shaped like it, an extra layer to her skirt (All the other senshi have 2, Moon has 3) a front bow styled to look like another set of 4 wings, A total Lack of a tiara, revealing the Crescent Moon on her head, little wing like accessories on her gloves, And a general hearts and Crescent moons on her uniform while all the other girls have stars. Even Chibi-Moon, who in her Super form wore pink version of the fancier version worn by moon, gets the same uniform as everyone else and no longer wears a special brooch on her front bow, getting the same Star shaped brooch.
</li><li> Makoto/Jupiter wears the uniform from her old school, but unlike a normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferStudentUniforms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferStudentUniforms">Transfer Student Uniforms</a> case, she has the excuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl">the new school not having a uniform in her size</a>. Once she enters highschool, however, she's able to find a normal Juuban uniform that fits her.
</li></ul></li><li> Partial example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>. The Barrier Jackets of most named characters are unique and very different from those worn by the generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesRUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesRUs">Space-Time Administration Bureau</a> combat mage. However, when they're not in battle, they wear the standard military uniform of their branch.
<ul><li> Nanoha tends to wear her instructor squad uniform most of the time, and only wears her Section 6 uniform on official business. Signum and Vita occasionally wear the "first class undersuit" as a less restrictive counterpart to the female uniform.
</li><li> After joining the Saint Church, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sister Sein</span> wears a nun outfit with short sleeves, for an unspecified reason relating to the rules.
</li></ul></li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em> have customized uniforms, mostly the head members of the student council, who wear different colored uniforms, including Shizuru (khaki) Haruka (green) and Reito (black). Natsuki also wears a hooded white sweatshirt with her uniform instead of the usual blouse, and Haruka's blouse is short-sleeved when she wears it with a vest.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>, Arika's uniform has pink trim, unlike the green in most Coral uniforms. The top Pearl wears a white uniform instead of gray, with red trim instead of yellow. Mai, however, wears bright orange trim with her Coral and Pearl uniforms.
</li></ul></li><li> Alice L. Malvin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em> wears a yellow uniform while everyone else in the army wears an olive one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em>, the 501st Joint Fighter Wing is a temporary multi-national unit, so the characters all wear the uniforms of their home services. This still doesn't explain why Minna, Gertrude, and Erica wear different style uniforms despite all of them being from the same unit, or why in the anime Yoshika just fights in her school clothes.
<ul><li> They're all from the same country, not unit. Minna wears the old Model 1936 tunic while the younger Gertrude wears a later M42 with fewer pockets and no pleats, while Erica wears a flight jacket instead.
</li><li> According to the official website, they're all from the Karlsland Luftwaffe, with Minna from JG3 and Erica and Gertrud from JG52.
</li><li> Further explained in fanbook that states Karlsland Luftwaffe does not supply its officers with uniforms but allocate portion of their pay as "uniform fee" as par real life German Luftwaffe. This means most of the officer's uniforms were custom tailored, and so are the Witches' uniforms. On the other hand, Liberion armed forces which supply the uniforms have very consistent uniforms on the Witches regardless of their service branch.

He even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hires a tailor to make an exact copy of it when the original is destroyed in a fight.</span>
<ul><li> This carries into part 4, where the main characters all use their school uniforms customized with Bling symbols (with the exception of Koichi).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Although there seems to be a base design for the arrancar uniform, some of the personal tailoring of the uniforms are so extreme they can look like a different uniform entirely with nothing more than colour scheme in common with the base uniform.
</li><li> Among Soul Society, anyone not wearing a bog-standard uniform is either a captain or lieutenant (barring Yumichika and Ikkaku). Variations range from sleevless haoris or miniskirts to additional accessories such as a scarf or additional kimono worn over their uniform.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, Toji Suzuhara is always wearing a track suit instead of the school uniform.
<ul><li> Only two NERV personnel are shown to deviate from the standard light-brown uniform with triangular crest: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Misato</a> with her red jacket and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Ritsuko</a> with her labcoat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleReverseQuadrupleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleReverseQuadrupleAgent">Kaji</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Fuyutsuki</a> merely wear a dark-brown version, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Gendo</a> has a black jacket (which, unlike the other characters, he habitually wears unbuttoned). Given Kaji and Fuyutsuki are particularly high in NERV command, and Gendo is even higher than they are, it's possible the color change is somehow indicative of rank.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, all Black Knights have an identical uniform, except for Zero and C.C., who aren't exactly Black Knight regulars. In R2, Kallen, Tohdoh and the Holy Swords have a unique pilot suit... which has custom colors for each of them. And also, Lelouch and C.C. also don't wear standard pilot suits - C.C. wears her normal dress, and Lelouch wears a special pilot suit of a different cut than Kallen and Tohdoh's, in Zero's black and gold color scheme.
<ul><li> Suzaku also possess a white pilot suit which is different to that of regular soldiers. How fortunate he is that the Knights of Round ALSO have white uniforms that are different from that of their subordinates.
</li><li> Viletta's day uniform as a Britannian Knight of Honor probably isn't regulation. Jeremiah also wears a different uniform, although he gets away with it by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">nobility</a>.

Many members add their own flourishes to their uniforms:
<ul><li> For the main characters, Tanjiro wears a green-and-black checkered haori over his uniform, while Zenitsu wears a yellow/orange haori with white triangles. Inosuke, on the other hand, deviates a lot from the standard uniform, wearing a belt made from animal furs, toeless and heelless kneesocks with sandles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">no shirt</a>, and a boar mask.
</li><li> Kanao wears a knee-length pleated skirt and knee-high boots instead of the hakama and sandals.
</li><li> Muichirou Tokitou's gakuran has wide Japanese-style sleeves and he wears his hakama loose; since he's the Mist Hashira, he prefers wearing long clothing that covers his limbs so his Mist Breathing techniques can be more effective.

</li><li> Kikuchi wears light-colored stockings instead of black stockings.
</li><li> Nancy goes for the punk style by wearing a collar, stud and skull-related accessories, a double-layered skirt, and fishnet stockings. Sid does the same, though he of course wears pants and boots instead of fishnets.

<ul><li> The government-sponsored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a> group initially split the difference between custom and uniform — they all shared a common color scheme, with individual variations — Madrox's full cowl and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a>, Havok's leather jacket and headgear, Strong Guy's coke-bottle glasses, etc. Quicksilver stuck out because he kept his traditional light-blue with silver lightning outfit.

When it's noted that the uniform is optional, Strong Guy says he wished somebody had told him that before he got a uniform.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> franchise has brought twists to this trope <em>twice</em>:
<ul><li> In the early issues of the "present day" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LEGIONDCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LEGIONDCComics">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a> '89</em>, characters wore a wide range of clothing styles reflecting culture, alien anatomy, and/or personal aesthetics, but they all shared the standard livery of black underlayer, white overgarments, and the L.E.G.I.O.N. symbol in gold. No two characters, even those in the background, ever wore quite the same outfit: despite this, they were all obviously members of the same force. Later artists got lazy and gave the rank-and-file grunts identical uniforms.
</li><li> In the main title, the Legionnaires had always had individual costumes. However, the early 90s younger versions of the team redesigned those costumes to have unifying elements: a three-part division with a center band of contrast running down the middle, from neck to bootline, and a thick black belt with Gadget Pouches and a very prominent Legion emblem on the buckle. All of these held on through the 1994 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a>, and the last through the 2004 "threeboot", and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedSeries">Animated Series</a>, even Superman added it to his own classic costume.
</li></ul></li><li> The bulk of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> Corps wear the standard bodysuit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask">Domino Mask</a> and ring. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">ring</a> is the only mandatory part, as it's the source of their powers. This means that there are many members who choose to customize their uniform, a good example being <a class="urllink" href="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100647/5903538-gls24.jpg">Guy Gardner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, whose uniform basically amounts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivvieSpandex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivvieSpandex">Civvie Spandex</a>. And that's not even getting into the members of the Corps that aren't humanoid, and need a uniform that perfectly fits their unique anatomy.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a> had a nominal uniform (red with a white stripe down the center), but this was hardly obvious because, of the original four members, the leader didn't wear a uniform, the robot didn't wear clothes at all, and of the two remaining, one was female and therefore had to get a skirt (it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>). It took the addition of a fifth member to have two actually wearing the same outfit.
</li><li> Whenever someone temporarily joins the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, there's no guarantee that they'll adapt the standard uniform. Some do (like Crystal and She-Hulk), while others (like Ant-Man, Storm, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>) choose to keep their own costumes instead. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> joined the Fantastic Four, having been temporarily re-themed the Future Foundation (or <em>FF</em>), they gave him a custom variation of their new mostly white uniforms, bearing a large spider symbol instead of the Future Foundation's three block logo.
<ul><li> Johnny's red-and-yellow outfit; Ben's alternating between trunks, belted singlet, pants, and bodysuit; Sue's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">Stripperific</a> period following the re-emergence of her Malice personality... the only founding member that hasn't had a Custom Uniform is Reed.
</li><li> Whenever comic stories explore the idea of the New Fantastic Four (Spider-Man, Wolverine, Ghost Rider and Hulk) sticking together, they'll either keep wearing their classic costumes, don Fantastic Four costumes or play this trope straight and don Fantastic Four-styled versions of their classic costumes.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a></em> Swedish comic strip 91:an (which could be described as a Swedish version of Beetle Bailey) have the namesake main character private 91 Karlsson still wearing the same old blue, glaringly anachronistic uniform he wore when the comic strip started back in 1932 (the cartoonist based it on the uniform he had worn as a conscript some decades earlier). The rest of the characters however, wear grey uniforms from the 1960s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many of the Street Judges have identical shoulder pads. Judge Dredd is a senior judge and like all senior judges, has a standard shoulder pad on his left shoulder, and on his right shoulder he has an eagle. In the movie, for practical reasons, the eagle was stylized, the body and feet of the eagle was completely removed, the eagle was attached to Stallone's chest not his arm, and the feathers were made flexible, so he could move his right arm.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">SJS</a> uniforms vary from standard judge uniforms in that they get different helmets and only wear an eagle on one shoulder. Also, chief judges wear a massive badge on their chest to denote their status as chief judge.
</li></ul></li><li> Dust from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> is allowed to continue wearing her veil and abaya (it's not a burqa) as part of the junior team, due to her religion. She is sometimes drawn wearing the X-belt, however.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> miniseries, the Bickleys (a married couple who serve as backups for the conn and ops stations, and who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">constantly argue with each other</a>) are the only members of Starfleet ever to be shown wearing a <em>leotard</em> variant of the uniform. They also wore bright green capes for some reason.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a> comic and later television adaptation the Guardians each have a different outfit once they transform into their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> selves; the uniforms do share the same green and purple color scheme with striped socks and can be still considered uniforms, also qualifying for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniformOfSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniformOfSexy">Custom Uniform of Sexy</a> for some. Their predecessors C.H.K.Y.N. (seriously) had the same setup and the WITCH fandom, of course, has created hundreds if not thousands of designs of their own in fanart and fanfiction (<a class="urllink" href="http://hapuriainen.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=WITCH#/d2rvknb">and some flash games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Why the girls get different outfits is never really discussed in universe, but they certainly seem appreciative of both the clothes and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower">assets</a> that come with them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron">X-Wing Rogue Squadron</a></em>, Ysanne Isard wore a red version of the Imperial officer's uniform, with admiral's insignia, despite not actually being in the military. As Director of Imperial Intelligence and answering only to the Emperor, she could get away with that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>: In Holliday College doesn't have a uniform, but the Holliday Girls sorority Etta Candy belongs to does and she's the only one who switches out the skirt of the uniform for shorts, and wears a tank top version of the top instead of a short sleeved jersey.
</li><li> For much of the history of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Shazam</a></em> franchise, Captain Marvel Jr. stood out boldly with his gold-on-blue costume with red cape compared to the rest of the Marvel Family's gold-on-red motif and white cape.

</li><li> Practically all of the uniform variants in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> film franchise fall under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform">Non-Uniform Uniform</a> category, as they're not custom so much as official variants. There are a couple of notable Custom Uniforms in the Classic Series films, though:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em>, Spock is wearing a blue-gray, split-collar tunic underneath his Vulcan robes when he arrives on the <em>Enterprise</em>, and wears that shirt underneath his duty uniform for the rest of the film; the only time he's not wearing it is when he changes into the thruster suit for his journey into the heart of V'Ger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em> introduces the "bomber jacket" version of the uniform introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>. Scotty also wears it in this film and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a></em>, as does Kirk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></em> introduces a tan field uniform, evocative of modern military fatigues (particularly the green sweaters of the British Army); Kirk, however, wears a charcoal grey variant.
</li><li> Scotty wears a command-division white undershirt with his engineering vest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">Star Trek IV</a></em>, <em>V</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry">VI</a></em>, instead of the operations/engineering-division gold shirt he normally wears with his regular uniform or causal bomber jacket. Not exactly normal Starfleet protocol to switch divisional colors on a whim, but then again, it's also not exactly common for a chief engineer to hold the rank of <em>captain</em>, either.
<ul><li> The white undershirt does create a minor continuity kerfluffle, though, between III and IV. With the crew on Vulcan at the end of III with only a captured Klingon Bird-of-Prey and the clothes on their backs, Scotty was wearing the gold undershirt with his bomber jacket. However, at the start of IV, he has the white undershirt (along with the previously-unseen engineering vest), and doesn't wear the gold undershirt again until the crew faces their fate in the Federation Council chambers at the end of the movie.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, Anakin is the only Jedi wearing black leather (except for Aayla Secura, who appears for a few seconds and then dies). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> info notes that the standard Jedi robes are not, in fact, a uniform. Any Jedi is free to wear whatever he/she/it wants, but they tend to wear the standard robes or variations on them to show solidarity. Anakin isn't breaking any rules, just traditions.
</li><li> However, the <em>Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force</em> retcons that by making the robes explicitly an uniform.
</li><li> As for the development of the Jedi appearance, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> Obi-Wan Kenobi was wearing practical clothes for Tantooine: loose dust-colored robe over loose dust-colored tunic in coarse hard wearing material it would be easy to beat the sand out of. He's in hiding so wearing a Jedi uniform doesn't make sense and nobody in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Mos Eisley</a> recognizes it as such. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> Yoda, for how small he is, seems to be wearing something similar. With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> and the massive increase of Jedi characters that outfit seems rather standard for Jedi, although with variations like Mace Windu's knee length robe.
</li><li> One novel has the perspective character musing that they're made of such itchy wool to force Jedi to constantly maintain self-control and discipline. Another story is that Jedi robes were selected precisely because they didn't stand out, effectively making them not uniforms at all. Anyone could wear robes or the cloaks that went over them. With the style Luke wore in the first film (being the non-Jedi ward of similarly dressed and similarly non-Jedi kin), it seems consistent. Of course, things changed.
</li><li> Back in the old days, if <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> is to be believed, a Padawan walking around the Jedi academy on Dantooine could be reprimanded for not wearing the Jedi robes, so there was some notion of them as a uniform. Though this <em>was</em> thousands of years before the movies. Bastila Shan still had a unique outfit, although for game technical reasons you'd typically see her wearing standard robes anyway (most armor looks the same on different characters, only just plain clothes look unique).
</li><li> As for Aayla Secura, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">female Twi'leks</a> are always required to wear revealing clothing.

</li></ul></li><li> Darth Vader fitted somewhere outside of but very high up in Imperial Navy's command structure  somewhere below Grand Moff Tarkin  but never wore a uniform. Vader's armor was life support, so he couldn't remove it. And a uniform tailored to fit over it would have made him look like a total dork. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire">Dark Empire</a></em>, when Luke briefly goes over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a> and serves as an apprentice under Palpatine, he gets the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">title and position as his father</a> and is dressed in a <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/File:SWDarkEmpireOmnibus.jpg">very similar outfit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, missing only the helmet and life support. You could say it's just Palpatine rubbing it in, but maybe it <em>is</em> a uniform.
<ul><li> It's more armor than a uniform, since the Vader design was based on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.museum-quality-samurai-armor.com/samurai_armor_all_for_sale/samurai_armor_for_sale_all/samurai_armor_105/samurai-armor_105__33.jpg">samurai armor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

He wore slippers instead of boots as the boots were uncomfortable for him to wear. This is why you never see Tarkin's feet in the movie.

Moist, as Postmaster General, wears a cloth-of-gold suit that doesn't even pretend to be a uniform, although he does wear a gilded version of the standard postman's hat.
</li><li> The Ankh-Morpork City Watch has expanded so rapidly in recent years and is composed of so many different shapes and sizes of copper that being in uniform usually means being in whatever pieces of the standard uniform happened to fit or could be modified on the quick, plus whatever antique specialty equipment they could scrape up from the dregs of the armory. Troll Sgt. Detritus ends up with armor originally intended for a battle elephant, not that he really needs it, and first female recruit Constable (later Sergeant and ultimately Captain) Angua has to go without a breastplate until she gets one modified to accommodate her... well, breasts. Vimes describes the overall look as "Funny helmets through the centuries." As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em> they've apparently got the budget for slightly more standardised gear (Detritus is mentioned as having traded in the battle-elephant armour for something at least made for his own species) but there seems to be no rule against buying your own kit if you can afford better than standard-issue.
</li><li> When Vimes himself is elevated to the nobility, he refuses to wear the tights or plumes that are part of his new uniform, though he can't initially do anything about the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">stupid ornamental armour</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy">Johnny Maxwell Trilogy</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldBritishComp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldBritishComp">Good Old British Comp</a> attended by the main characters has a uniform but doesn't enforce it, to the point where only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndNerdy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndNerdy">Yo-less</a> wears it. Which, according to Wobbler's logic, means that jeans and T-shirts are the <em>real</em> school uniform, which means Yo-less is out of uniform.
</li><li> The Adumari Union pilots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Starfighters of Adumar</a></em> are, technically, all wearing standard flight suits - although since they're part of a multinational force that has only recently come together, they're all different colors - but have no restrictions on decorations, medals, what have you; their commander had a bank of medals that could double as a bludgeon if it had to.
<ul><li> The series also mentions how the Rogues, when they go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">rogue</a>, enjoy personalizing their X-Wings' color schemes, while Wraith Squadron when masquerading as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">pirates</a> gets to do the same. And even when working for the Rebellion, Corran Horn's fighter and flightsuit retain their original CorSec colors, since they're his personal property rather than issued by the military. Though it probably shouldn't be surprising that a rebels' military has a lax attitude towards standardization...
<ul><li> After Corran is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">declared missing in action and presumed dead</a> (<em>The Krytos Trap</em>), Rogue Squadron has their flight suits changed from the orange seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> to dark green with black and white trim, after Corran's X-Wing. It's never stated whether they changed back after he reappears.

<ul><li> Harrington has had her uniform reinforced to protect her shoulder from Nimitz's claws, although the books make it clear that this is a standard variation in uniform, for personel who have been adopted.
</li><li> Michael Oversteegen and other aristocrats seem to enjoy wearing uniforms modified for less practical reasons.
<ul><li> A specially tailored uniform (for reasons other than purely utilitarian ones <em>a la</em> Honor's reinforcements) is one of the Honorverse's stock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> traits; it's <em>not</em> allowed by regs. Therefore powerful aristocrats wear them to flaunt being above the rules. Oversteegen is the only character who wears such a thing and isn't a complete asshole. (Having the Designated Asshole Traits while actually being the complete opposite of one is kind of Oversteegen's schtick).
</li></ul></li><li> The escapees from the Havenite prison planet of Hades had a lot of time on their hands, and access to programmable uniform manufacturing equipment, so they made themselves uniforms. These were proper, compliant uniforms— but since many of them came from defunct militaries from planets that had been conquered by Haven decades in the past, a lot of them wound up wearing totally one-of-a-kind looks anyway.

</li><li> Craig Lowell, from the WEB Griffin <em>Brotherhood of War</em> series, is an obscenely wealthy, old-money type who was kicked out of college and drafted during WWII, then chose to stay in the army. While all of his uniforms are custom made, they are uniform. However, while most officers have dress blues for formal wear, he went a step beyond and purchased the dress mess uniform, which goes so far as to include a cape. This irritates people.
</li><li> Many of the knights in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> wear distinctive custom-made armor and use distinctive personal weapons rather than any kind of standard-issue equipment... which they wouldn't have had, anyway, being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">knights</a></em>, rather than common levies in livery.

Student heralds wear grey. Bards and Healers wear red and green, respectively, with students having a variation. This coding is commented on in-story, essentially saying that in stressful situation, such as a riot or fire, the townspeople can look for that color uniform. A few characters avert this in everyday wear, and are allowed to because of their teaching duties (weapon use). One character sort of subverts this plain white uniform (or has it subverted for her) by her uniforms being remade with embroidery and other designs, but all in white.
<ul><li> Early in the <em>Collegium Chronicles</em>, we learn that upper-class parents of a Heraldic Trainee often insist on providing their child with a custom-tailored version of the official uniform, in higher-quality fabrics. When Mags is invited to a councilor's home over the Midwinter holidays, a Herald collects enough of these outgrown custom Grays to let Mags dress appropriately for the surroundings. (This may be the "ancestor" of the Formal Grays that we see later in the chronology.)

It's implied that she's allowed to get away with it for the same reason they ignore her patently fake name; she's almost certainly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> daughter of a High Family who wants to make her own way.

<ul><li> Curtis generally wears a vest or t-shirt on top, tying the jumpsuit's sleeves around his waist.

He also always wears a medallion of a saint and a cross.
</li><li> Alisha generally shows some cleavage and rolls up her sleeves, pops her collar and rolls her trouser legs into capris. She also always wears a belt around her waist, further showing off her figure. She usually wears make-up, jewelry and ballet flats, despite the fact that they're doing manual labor.
</li><li> Kelly, like Alisha, doesn't wear a shirt under her jumpsuit. She keeps hers open at the collar, though doesn't undo as many buttons as Alisha. Kelly doesn't go to much effort to make hers more flattering or fashionable, more sort of surrendering to the ugliness. She does, however, keep on her jewelry and make-up and is (according to her twitter) devoted to Adidas, wearing them both for community service and civilian life.
</li><li> Nathan's is worn open to about the belly button with a visible t-shirt underneath. His jumpsuit is also the most stained, covered in paint and blood. The word 'pay' in the phrase 'Community Payback' has been crossed off and replaced with 'blow'.
</li><li> Simon wears his jumpsuit buttoned up to the chin: precise, neat, and respectful. This, of course, makes him "look a bit like a paedophile" according to Nathan, but fitting his shy personality it also looks like he's trying to hide in it.

<ul><li> Worf wears a Klingon sash/baldric over his Starfleet uniform and has long hair, quite un-regulation.
</li><li> Troi wears a low-cut lavender catsuit for much of the series. She was ordered to wear a standard Starfleet uniform by Jellico in "Chain of Command".
<ul><li> And to her credit, after being ordered to wear it, she continues to wear it for the rest of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, Ensign Ro is told to remove her Bajoran earring when she's assigned to the <em>Enterprise</em>. Picard agrees to let her wear it by the end of her first episode. Similarly, in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, during Tuvok's turn as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a>, he insists that his Maquis trainees eschew personal affectations.
<ul><li> Generally, while <em>personal</em> modifications are met with disapproval<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16x4i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16x4i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16x4i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">at least beyond a certain point; hair decorations like Alice bands are apparently permitted if they're in matte colours that match the weaerer's uniform</span>, <em>cultural</em> modifications are accommodated. Ro's case was largely due to unfamiliarity with Bajoran culture (including Bajorans listing their surnames first), and was largely corrected for, as future Bajorans seen in Starfleet uniform generally sport their earrings, such as Kira Nerys when she is given a battlefield commission of Lieutenant Commander. Worf was almost never seen without his baldric, which displayed his Klingon heritage, and later on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, when Nog enrolls in Starfleet, he replaces his traditional Ferengi headwear with a piece that matches the shoulder fabric. Some captains go so far as to <em>enforce</em> cultural wear upon any subordinates native to that culture, and consider them out of uniform if <em>not</em> wearing, such as one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em> where Worf oversleeps and rushes to the bridge late for his duty shift, only for Picard to order him to straighten his baldric.
</li></ul></li><li> Dialogue in the TNG episode <em>Chain of Command</em> indicated that wearing informal clothing instead of a standard uniform is allowed, <em>with</em> the captain's permission (and also that it was mostly commonly granted to senior officers in specialized positions), and the series is relatively consistent in showing that captains and above have a more 'casual' variant of their uniform (sort of an inverse to a dress uniform).
</li><li> Admirals from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> on seem to be a straighter example—we see such a wide variety of outfits that either Starfleet Command is <em>constantly</em> changing flag officers' uniforms, or they can wear whatever they want as long as you can tell that it is a uniform.
<ul><li> Many of the admirals seem to be wearing similar variants however, that look almost like the modern "mess dress" variants of British Army uniforms.
</li><li> Picard also gets a less formal variant, introduced in the fifth season episode "Darmok". Inspired by the flocked "bomber jacket" alternate uniform from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">the film series</a>, Picard's alternate uniform is a flocked open jacket with quilted black shoulders, over a gray uniform shirt with black shoulders and collar. Except for scenes which called for Picard to be without the jacket (such as in its first appearance, "Darmok"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a> usually wore a one-piece version with the gray part being a sewn-in panel with its closure hidden beneath the right jacket flap, so as not to overburden the actor with heavy layers during filming.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> pre-dated the rest by featuring Kirk's deep green wraparound jacket, worn interchangeably with his usual uniform tunic during the first two seasons. Nobody else aboard was ever seen wearing this alternative uniform (except, bizarrely, Charlie Evans in the episode "Charlie X", who wore a brown version).
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> versions of Kirk and Spock in "Mirror, Mirror" had Custom Uniforms themselves; Kirk (though only seen on <em>our</em> Kirk) had a glittery sleeveless version of the wraparound, with shoulderboards to represent his position as captain, while Spock (the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">with the beard</a>) wore a modified dress uniform.
</li><li> Speaking of the Mirror Universe, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> two-parter "In A Mirror, Darkly" finally establishes that the green wraparound <em>was</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform">standard variant</a>, at least for captains, as Mirror!Archer takes one from the deceased <em>Defiant</em> captain's wardrobe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>: Major Kira's uniform underwent a few modifications to give it more feminine accents not found on other Bajorans' uniforms. She wore a standard two-piece uniform in the pilot, but for the rest of the first three seasons, the top seemlingly ended beneath the belt. Starting early in the fourth season, she wore a more feminine version (keeping the modifications during her pregnancy). When she was promoted to colonel for the seventh season, her uniform became even more feminine, and looked nothing like that of previous Bajoran colonels.
<ul><li> Starting in the 3rd season, Odo's uniform was modified from the standard Bajoran security uniform too, with a higher collar and a belt (which he later discarded). The collar was inspired by an identical design on Mirror!Odo's uniform in "Crossover", a look the actor and crew liked.

From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a></em> onward, the heavily-armored Ranger-like characters tend to be referred to as knights. You'll <em>never</em> have any trouble telling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> from the others. When the team is made of sub-teams, you'll also have no trouble telling who's with who even if you've never seen the series before because the suits will have minor changes. Even then, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> will be more bling-tastic.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> at least, not only this, but when the Rangers are part of an organization, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>'s <em>unmorphed</em> uniform will be different in more than the usual color coding. (For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Space Rangers</a>' uniforms were gray with color-coded T-shirts beneath. The Silver Ranger's was black with a gray t-shirt. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">Overdrive</a>, Tyzonn gets two silver stripes going down the middle of his uniform, while the part you'd expect to be silver is orange.

This isn't a universal rule, though.
</li><li> It does apply to unmorphed uniforms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> too. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger">Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger</a></em>, Tetsu's uniform was mainly white with navy accents, the same colours as his morphed suit. We find out the special unit he came from always has uniforms like this, as when his chief shows up, hers is like his. The core five's were mainly black with accents in their own colour. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger">Engine Sentai Go-onger</a></em>, the Wings wore gold and silver jackets, instead of black motor-racing suits with ranger-coloured writing and trim.

Only the characters who are straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> (Lucky, Spada, and Hamy) have "ordinary" costumes, while everyone else gets touches that nod to their races or homeworlds: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a> Garu's suit has fur, androids Balance and Champ have a more mechanical look, scorpion-man Stinger has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareMyStingerTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareMyStingerTail">stinger tail</a>, Raptor (who represents Aquila) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings">little angel wings</a> on her back, and Naga (from the Ophiuchus system) has a snakeskin pattern on the sides of his suit. As in past series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Rangers</a> have their own unique touches: Ryu Commander's suit has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> aspect (similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard">Kamen Rider Wizard</a>), Koguma Skyblue has a "scarf" with weighted tassels that he can use as a weapon (symbolizing his being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a>) and Hou'ou Soldier's suit looks more armored and militarized, complete with a headset and microphone built into the helmet<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27yar');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27yar" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27yar');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, both Koguma Skyblue and Hou'ou Soldier are Earthlings but still have fancier costumes than some of the alien members of the team</span>.

</li><li> This trope is extremely common in war games. Unless a game abstracts an entire large unit to one "block," it is essential to distinguish the leader of a unit for the sake of the <em>players</em>. Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 enforce this trope by requiring in the rules that a unit's leader can be clearly identified and using different models to represent them.
</li><li> In addition to this, every system in the Imperium (And there are millions) has a different uniform for their Guard units, as well as unique uniforms for their PDF forces (Some planets have multiple uniforms for their PDF units, depending on what region the unit in question is based in). This has resulted in loyal Guard units attacking other loyal Guard units on occasion because they didn't recognize each others uniforms and assumed the other unit was a hostile.

Even during the field exam, Squall and Zell modify their trainee uniforms slightly, Squall leaving his jacket open and Zell wearing his with the sleeves rolled back; Seifer and his buddies Fujin and Raijin never wear the trainee uniform at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>, the main characters are supposedly all wearing Crownsguard Fatigues, which all have an uncanny similarity to expensive designer alternative fashion clothing. They are all black and share skull and crossbones motifs, but the designs are totally different for each character, and reflects each character's individual personality and aesthetic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>, all named units (your units, potential recruits, and bosses) have a custom color scheme, while everyone else on the bad side gets their uniforms colored based on their affiliation. It can get a bit odd in cases where potential recruits start out fighting on the enemy's side; they are the only one aside from their general to wear a custom uniform.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> takes place predominantly at the Officers Academy in Garreg Mach Monastery. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">Military Academy</a>, the students naturally wear school uniforms, consisting of black button-up dress shirts with gold accents and either matching slacks or dresses. Many students, however, add their own touches to their uniforms. To name some examples: Dorothea wears jewelry and a flat cap while unbuttoning the top of her uniform to show her cleavage, Mercedes wears a tan cardigan over a black vest with a white blouse, and Raphael foregoes wearing the uniform coat, instead only dressed in slacks and a white shirt that strains against his bulging muscles. The house leaders (Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude) wear custom uniforms that closely resemble military uniforms and include a shoulder cape in the color of their respective houses. The Ashen Wolves, meanwhile, dress predominantly in white with silver and violet accents. Following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, the now-former students replace their uniforms for unique outfits that are more par for the course of <em>Fire Emblem</em>.

As the callsign was chosen by the player, it wasn't practical to allow customized callsigns on the nametag, with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionCutscenes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionCutscenes">Live Action Cutscenes</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em>, the Arachnos Spider and Widow epic archetypes' primary costumes are restricted to standard Arachnos parts, but they can still make themselves look different from the rank and file Arachnos NPC's, and their alternate costume slots don't have those restrictions at all, except for Crab Spiders having to have their trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">mechanical arms</a> in all of them.

However, in the final quests for the Legion, the player acquires the artifact Lord's Mail, which is basically the best heavy armor in the game and <em>also</em> a Legion uniform cuirass, thus being a truly unique custom uniform for a legionnaire. Story-wise the PC is becoming the Knight of the Imperial Dragon (commander of all Legion regiments in the region) at this point.
<ul><li> This applies to NPCs too, alot of the named ones wear the chest piece with whatever patchwork of other pieces of armor (imperial chain, imperial steel, imperial leather, iron, steel, netch, even chitin).
</li><li> Not to mention that as Knight of the Imperial Dragon you outrank anyone who would otherwise care about your lack of uniform (this is a deliberate design of the dialogue function that makes legionnaires complain if you talk to them out-of-uniform — it only applies to legionnaires of equal or higher rank than you).

The U.B.C.S. Mercenaries in <em>RE3</em> have a stricter dress code, but Carlos has a cut down version of a typical uniform.
<ul><li> The ones from HUNK's unit however, all wear the same thing.
</li><li> Extra materials reveal that the team wore mismatched uniforms because the R.P.D. didn't have the budget for anything else at the time, and Chris' outfit in <em>Code: Veronica</em> was the prototype for what would have eventually been the standardized S.T.A.R.S. uniform.
</li><li> This doesn't just apply to the S.T.A.R.S. either. Player characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Leon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak">Kevin</a> are members of the normal R.P.D. but still have a different outfit from the other rank &amp; file officers, and even then their two uniforms don't perfectly match (Kevin's has an Oxford-style collar, while Leon's has a Mandarin collar).

<ul><li> This carries over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a></em>, where Prarie has a custom uniform from the other Guardians.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II: Renegade</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Krimzon Guards</a> have four kinds of uniforms: red for normal ones, yellow for inexplicably stronger ones, one for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Errol</a> and one for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">Ashelin</a>.

</li><li> Most Alliance Marines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> appear to wear black armor, in sharp contrast to Ashley's white-and-pink. Also, normal Alliance starships are white and red, while the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Normandy</a></em> - an experimental prototype designed in cooperation with the turians - is black and white. In the third game, it's repainted blue and white. This was actually an <em>aversion</em>, as all Alliance ships had been switched to those colors, and thus showed that the Alliance had taken control of the Cerberus-built SR-2.
<ul><li> Though strangely whichever human crew member survives Virmire (or Liara, if she was Shepard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> in the first game) shows up in the same white-and-pink during the opening sequence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, while Shepard sticks with the standard black Alliance armor (plus a red stripe to denote rank). They also return in the third game with armor that is not even the same <em>style</em> as other marines.
</li><li> Miranda's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyCatsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyCatsuit">Spy Catsuit</a> doesn't seem to be standard-issue for Cerberus personnel, especially considering the proportions required to make it work.
</li><li> Joker wears the standard Alliance (or Cerberus in 2) uniform, however he always wears a dark blue hat (white for Cerberus) with SR-1 (SR-2 for the 2nd Normandy) on it. It doesn't seem special at first until you notice no other crewman on either ship has a similar hat, and he never takes it off. (Though since he is a pilot, and we never see another one, it could theoretically be a standard issue mark of the job.)
</li><li> James Vega typically sports deep blue-grey armour, despite being an Alliance marine.
</li><li> For a villainous example, Kai Leng's armour isn't really sported by any other Cerberus troops, although a male Shepard can get a variant by earning more than 10,000 points in the combat simulator on the Citadel DLC.

Of course, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a> man Aldo isn't constrained by the standard colourless Corleone costume, though it's still somewhat limited; you can't, say, go for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Alucard-</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Dante</a>-esque crimson or the yellow of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Spike Spiegel</a>.

This is even handwaved by one of the Loading Screens giving the year uniform regulations were relaxed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series delves into both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonuniformUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonuniformUniform">Nonuniform Uniform</a>:
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1">Persona</a></em>, each of the playable characters have their own personal flair. The protagonist, Maki, Eriko, and Nanjo wear the uniform correctly, but have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem">an earring, compact-amulet, an orange scarf, and a light blue #1 scarf</a> respectively. Yukino also wears the uniform correctly, but wears a much longer skirt. Masao/Mark also has an earring, but he wears a turtleneck shirt, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a>, and carries around a yellow tagger's backpack. Hidehiko wears a purple longsleeve shirt with his jacket half open, numerous bangles, red boots, and has a pair of sunglasses perched on his head. Yuko wears a skirt that is half the length of the standard skirt and she wears a blue-with-green-stripes jacket and baggy knee-socks. Reiji goes around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">with his jacket open and no shirt on</a> and wears a pair of American flag motif <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerlessGloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerlessGloves">Fingerless Gloves</a>.
</li><li> In serious contrast to the other <em>Persona</em> games, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em> duology only has the instance of a one Eikichi "Michel" Mishina, who wears a long tunic that sticks out from under his jacket and over his uniform pants. In <em>Innocent Sin</em>, Tatsuya, Lisa, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jun</span> wear their uniforms without any changes whatsoever, although Tatsuya has his jacket unbuttoned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tatsuya foregoes a school uniform entirely in <em>Eternal Punishment</em>, opting for a red motorcycle tracksuit.</span>
</li><li> The only ones that actually wear proper uniforms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> (including the PSP version) are the female protagonist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Aigis</a>, and even then, Aigis wears the winter uniform even in summer in order to hide her robot joints. The male protagonist wears his winter uniform blazer unbuttoned and the uniform pants for both versions are slightly above his ankles and he wears a pair of engineer-style boots. Junpei always wears a ball cap and a blue shirt instead of a white one. Yukari wears a choker, a pink sweater instead of the winter uniform jacket and a shorter skirt. Fuuka wears a green turtleneck instead of the white shirt. Akihiko wears a red sweater vest and neither he nor Mitsuru ever wears the uniform jacket. Mitsuru at least has the excuse of "her father pays for this school", but the others don't. Ryoji also wears suspenders instead of a belt, rolls up his sleeves, and wears an absurdly long scarf instead of the uniform jacket.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> is similar to its predecessor in that only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> wears the correct uniform, but the winter version jacket is unbuttoned and he has his shirt untucked with both versions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickChick">Chie</a> wears a green sports jacket over her winter uniform and wears the summer uniform correctly, with her jacket tied around her waist; she also wears bike shorts under her skirt for both uniforms. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">Yosuke</a> is always wearing headphones around his neck and foregoes the winter uniform shirt for a longsleeved V-neck shirt, but wears the summer uniform shirt with a shortsleeved V-neck shirt under it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yukiko</a> wears a red sweater or cardigan over her uniform top, depending on the uniform version she's wearing. Kanji wears his winter uniform jacket like a cape and only wears the uniform pants during the summer. Rise wears the uniform correctly in the summer, but the only variation she makes to the winter uniform is that she wears a white turtleneck under the uniform top. Naoto <em>does</em> wear unaltered winter and summer uniforms...but it's the <em>boy's uniform</em>, which she continues to wear even after her real gender is revealed. The only time she wears a girl's uniform is if she's your Christmas Date and you request she embrace her femininity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> has the protagonist subvert this trope as he wears his uniforms properly down to the footwear (in his opinion it's stylish). The party members still play it straight however. Ryuji wears his winter and summer uniform with bright graphic tees, his pantlegs rolled up, and white sneakers. Ann wears her winter uniform with a white zip-up hoodie underneath her blazer with the sleeves rolled up and red leggings underneath, while her summer uniform is worn properly with a blue jacket tied around her waist. Yusuke never wears a tie, wears his winter uniform with an untucked non-regulation shirt and no blazer, and for his summer uniform he replaces his school's shirt and vest combo with a dark-blue shirt. Makoto wears her winter uniform correctly but replaces the blazer with a black vest and her summer uniform is worn with a dress shirt instead of the school polo, a belt around her waist, and black leggings underneath. Haru wears a pink turtleneck cardigan over her winter uniform with floral tights and replaces the polo shirt with a purple turtleneck tank top for her summer uniform.

There are reasonable justifications, however. Squad 7 is a Militia unit, not regular Army, so they are pretty much left with whatever uniforms and gear the Regulars aren't using. Welkin is a very self-aware <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie">Ensign Newbie</a>, and his relationship with his subordinates is antagonistic enough without him going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">Neidermeyer</a> and trying to enforce strict uniform regs in the middle of a shooting war. There is a war on, and it's pretty universal that in a combat zone, uniform regs can be relaxed a little.
<ul><li> It is quite notable that whenever the Regulars show up, they are always in impeccable uniform, probably to contrast them against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> that is Squad 7.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. It's only been very recently (in historical terms) that officers have had standardized uniforms, and even more recently that personal touches have been frowned upon. Patton and Montgomery are two of the more notable ones from as recently as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. There is a joke in the British Army that if two officers from the Intelligence Corps appear at breakfast wearing identical clothing the junior officer must go and get changed.
<ul><li> Montgomery, when he was training officers at the British Staff College in the 1920s, specifically stated that a general should have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">distinctive hat</a>. Later, while he was preparing the fight against Rommel, he started using his distinctive beret, even if it went against the officers dress code. The highest rank command told him repeatedly to stick to the rules, to which he replied that they could go to hell, since he was well aware of having being recognized all over the army, and even the civilian population back in UK, specifically because 'the general wearing a beret' directly told everybody that it was him.
</li><li> General Douglas MacArthur's innate sense of theatre made him an interesting case. Despite his reputation for flamboyant dress during wartime (his iconic WWII outfit was actually fairly mild compared to WWI when his troops called him "the fighting dude"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30h46');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note30h46" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30h46');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Dude" at the time meaning "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">dandy</a>"</span> and he often went into battle wearing jodhpurs, riding boots and his West Point varsity letter sweater armed only with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaffOfAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaffOfAuthority">riding crop</a>) he always wore impeccable regulation uniforms in peacetime. Each look was carefully calculated to fit the image he was trying to project and the audience he was trying to impress. The fact that he chose to make his famous farewell address wearing a civilian suit did not go unnoticed.
<ul><li> Nor, for that matter, did the fact that when he was ordered to meet with President Truman at Midway to discuss how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a> was going, he met the president in battered fatigues. Supposedly, he was trying to make it clear that he was subordinate to the President by making sure he wasn't as sharply dressed, but it was widely interpreted to be an insult.
</li></ul></li><li> George S. Patton devised a <a class="urllink" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xxJWs1i2nc0/SDMVfMJHJcI/AAAAAAAAAr4/9iZGFxIayHI/s400/Patton">distinctive uniform<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the Armored Force around the end of the 1930s. It was made of emerald-green gabardine, with a diagonal row of metal buttons running down the front of the abbreviated tunic, and topped with a gold-colored football helmet (any resemblance to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica (1978)</a></em> uniforms are purely coincidental). It was immediately dubbed the "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreenHornet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreenHornet">Green Hornet</a>", from the radio program, and officers made a point of visiting Patton's unit to see him wearing it. The "Green Hornet" was not adopted, of course, even after Patton submitted <a class="urllink" href="http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/PattonMuseum/OtherExhibits/images/10PattonsGreenHornetTankersUniform.jpg">a much milder version in brown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ofck');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ofck" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ofck');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The shape of the uniform was actually very logically designed: wraparound tunic could not tangle in the metal bits and pieces inside the tank, rimless shape of the helmet made entrance through narrow hatches easier (the final tanker helmet was a football helmet, just a different pattern, and no gold paint). It got rejected just because it looked ridiculous.</span> The Germans had the same idea, and their tank crews wore <a class="urllink" href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30095598">a black wraparound uniform<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from 1934 throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>; surprisingly, it was not confused with the black uniforms of the SS, probably due to differing styles and insignia.
</li><li> The German panzer arm and the SS also shared the Death's Head insignia, which, in turn, was the emblem of the Prussian Hussars. Their uniforms were actually confused for each other's by their enemies rather often, with occasional unfortunate consequences for the wearers.
<ul><li> The British Armored 17th Lancers also had the "Death's Head" badge (dating back to the 7 years war, when they adopted it from German units).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> almost never bothered with his own uniform, to the point that he only got into the Appomattox Court House surrender ceremony in his dirty fatigues and splattered with mud because the Confederates knew him by sight. In contrast Robert E. Lee was fully dressed in his best uniform for the surrender, with one observer commenting that if you hadn't known better you'd have thought Lee had won. Lee had been forced to abandon his baggage train earlier that week and he naturally chose to change into the best uniform he had left before ditching all of the others. Lee played into this trope as well by typically wearing the insignia and uniform of a colonel, despite his rank in the Confederate army. Among modern infantrymen, many would think Grant made the right choice - his mud-spattered uniform showed that he was "in the shit," and not just a desk officer who had the time to get clean.
</li><li> To this day, according to United States Army Regulation 670-1 (the document pertaining to the wear of the uniform), Generals of the Army, the Chief of Staff, and former Chiefs of Staff can alter their uniform however they like. They still can't <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Michael_Boorda#Death">wear medals or ribbons they aren't entitled to though<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Only applies to their branch insignia, not the whole uniform. Of course at that high of a rank, and that the Chief of Staff approves uniform changes anyway, they can do whatever they want.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Uniform regulations also generally make concessions to religious practices where practical. For example, Mormon soldiers are issued with brown Temple Garments that match with their outer uniform. Sikh turban is RAF uniform and is issued. As is a tube of gel to put on his beard when wearing a gasmask. There have been Sikhs fighting for Britain since at least the 1750s, although prior to 1858 they would have been in a distinct minority, so there's a long history of this.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedsWithRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedsWithRockets">Soviet Army</a>, relying principally on conscription to supply manpower, inevitably encompassed the dozens of different recognized nationalities within the nation. With conscription being a sort of difficult rite of passage for many young men, when their terms of service ended, the same men were allowed what was informally called a demobilization uniform, if they desired, which would feature whatever items, patches, or other trinkets they had collected. The only requirement was that still vaguely resemble their original service uniforms, and as a result, many men returning to their homes wore some truly gaudy and flashy tunics with extra aiguillettes, shoulder insignia, and more. The units/branches where this practice was most widespread even gained a nickname of "motor-sewing", a pun on motor-rifle regiments.
</li><li> This trope was actually the reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommissarCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommissarCap">Commissar Cap</a> ever became the regulation cap of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets">Russians with Rusting Rockets</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia">the 90es</a>. Originally it was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> military chic, where some officers begun competing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">having the biggest and highest cap in the unit</a>. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SukhomlinovEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SukhomlinovEffect">some brass loved the style</a> and put it into the regs, which ironically coincided with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">The Great Politics Mess-Up</a>.
</li><li> The Duke of Wellington spent most of the Napoleonic Wars in civvies, as he was the commander of several different nation's armies and didn't want to play favorites. Also, The Iron Duke didn't care about what his officers wore, as long as they and their units could fight. Sir Thomas Picton commanded a cavalry charge in civilian evening dress and swinging an umbrella, and at one point fought a battle in pyjamas. Neither of those incidents were voluntary, but the point stands.
</li><li> And there's Hermann Goering's famous ornate uniforms. A joke told in Germany at the time had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> inspecting the latest warship, only to see Goering (who'd turned early) looking out a porthole. Hitler says: "That man's gone too far — now he's draped an entire battleship around his neck!"
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKoreansWithMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKoreansWithMarines">South Korean men</a> get discharged after their mandatory conscription, many will get their final uniforms, which they will wear to reserve training, "tuned". The more sedate version of tuning involves swapping out subdued patches for full-color versions and getting unit mottos embroidered on caps. Gaudier tuning can involve flashy metal versions of the reservist cap badge, slogans embroidered in red and gold thread up and down sleeves and trouser legs, fancy boots, and qualifications loudly proclaimed through enormous embroidered lettering.
</li><li> Particularly when dealing with school uniforms, students do their damnedest to get away with as much as they possibly can. Apparently when they were filming one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies, the adolescent extras were told specifically to wear their uniforms how they would normally wear them in such a situation, so some loosened or removed the tie, some hiked up their skirts, etc. In the fifth film when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/HarryPotter">Umbridge</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">takes over</a> she forces the students to look more standardised. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">Or at least tries to</a>.
</li><li> U-Boat crews during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> wore anything but uniforms while at sea. While they had grey leathers for waterproofing and warmth, they are often seen in captured British Battledress uniforms for working clothes. Come to that, the German rescue services for air raids often wore captured Russian or Danish helmets and uniform as working dress. The Volkssturm also used many and varied uniforms. In fact, most Volkssturm in 1944 had nothing more than armbands, not unlike their British counterparts from a few years before.
</li><li> The British Home Guard, in its early days, was equipped with whatever was left after the already under-equipped regulars had taken first pick. For a long while the only uniform to speak of was a small armband, and enforcement of uniform regulations remained spotty long after proper battledress trickled down.
</li><li> The late William Rehnquist, when he was Chief Justice of the United States, added four stripes to the sleeves of his court robes, because he'd seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Iolanthe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Iolanthe">Iolanthe</a></em> and thought it was cool. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor often wear lace cravats with their robes, a tradition started by the first woman on the Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. All this is entirely legal, as the robe is the Justice's personal property, purchased at his or her own expense. Furthermore, the Court's regulations only require that Justices wear black robes in the situations that call for it, but don't say anything else about the subject.
</li><li> Militia type organizations in the United States. Typically, these are groups of local citizens who equip themselves with whatever is at hand. As a result, it's perfectly possible to go to militia practice and see guys in US Woodland BDU's, Vietnam era olive drab, ACU, DPM, CADPAT, Alpenflage, business suits, Multicam, Flecktarn, and Gorod. Weapons are seldom standardized either, so you'll see everything from AR's to AK's to Garands to FAL's.
</li><li> The Texas Rangers (a statewide investigative agency in Texas)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5na1m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5na1m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5na1m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not to be confused with the other Texas Rangers, a Major League <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Baseball</a>, who have very standardized uniforms</span> uniform consists of a badge, a visible weapons belt, boots and "Western clothing". Their uniform manual is more a list of suggestions then actual rules. Of course, considering that there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger">a good reason</a> why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">they're Rangers</a>...
<ul><li> They are not a traditional police force, being more akin to a state-level version of the FBI. When they need traditional cops, they get help from local police departments and the Highway Patrol. They also do have uniforms, which strongly resemble the Highway Patrol, but these are traditionally worn for more formal occasions, and in situations where they want to make their presence known such as security details.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://girlscouts.org/">Girl Scouts of the USA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> haven't required girls to wear a full uniform for years now, but they still made them. As of October 2008, they've taken this further:
<div class="indent">Girl Scouts at each level have one required element (Tunic, Sash or Vest) for the display of official pins and awards which will be required when girls participate in ceremonies or officially represent the Girl Scout Movement. <br/>For girls ages 5 to 14, the unifying look includes wearing a choice of a tunic, vest, sash for displaying official pins and awards, combined with their own solid white shirts and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scouts in high school can also wear a scarf that unites their look with the sisterhood of Girl Scouts around the world. <br/>For adult members the unifying look of the uniform is a Girl Scout official scarf or tie for men, worn with the official membership pins, combined with their own navy blue business attire. Girl Scouts at the Daisy and Brownie levels will continue to have a full uniform ensemble available.
</div><ul><li> There are so many different shades of khaki - never mind that Cadettes' vests often don't match their pants - that it leads to rather a <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/cheebalicious/Girl%20Scouts/Junior%20yr%202/100_1361.jpg">lack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/cheebalicious/Girl%20Scouts/Junior%20yr%202/100_1362.jpg">of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/cheebalicious/Girl%20Scouts/Junior%20yr%202/100_1384.jpg">uniformity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Boy Scouts of America share only a standard uniform shirt and common rank, merit and leadership patches. Pants can be either long or short; some units require one or the other, whereas others allow either. Different units can have their own regional and unit insignia and patches, nametags, hats, and neckerchiefs. Scouts from the same unit have largely identical uniforms, but the insignia on top of the common shirt and pants can look wildly different between troops.
</li><li> While <a class="urllink" href="http://www.girlguides.ca/">Girl Guides of Canada<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> requires full uniforms, there are endless options for clothing that normally result no two girls in a troop look the same. The uniform consists of: long and short sleeved option for t-shirts, e pants or capris, leggings, a hat when camping a hoodie of vest for cold weather, a sash for displaying the badges, a neck scarf (the same as the one described above for girl scouts) and the characteristic stripey socks.
</li><li> Wal-mart only requires its employees to wear blue shirts, brown pants, and their name badge. What shade of blue and what shade of brown is completely irrelevant, and they can be any style of shirt or pants (provided it stays within reasonable dress code). Though most simply choose the standard navy blue, collared shirts. They did away with the uniform blue vests a couple years ago for unknown reasons.
<ul><li> Similarly, Target requires its employees to wear tan pants and a red shirt, with no guidance beyond those points.
</li><li> At the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girl</a> Place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>, employees are required to wear black pants, black shoes, and black socks. Shirts can be of any colors so as long it's solid and no logos/patterns, while those working in the cafe have to have white button-down shirts. (Might apply to some of the other stores.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a> usually don't have set uniforms. Most members either wear civilian clothes underneath their tactical gear, or whatever military fatigues the members own. In the Post 2003 Iraq era Paul Bremer's personal security detail made the "Tactical Tuxedo" (consisting of desert boots + 5.11 brand Cargo Pants + 5.11 Shirt + Riggers Belt + Plate Carrier + Ballistic Sunglasses) popular, with a lot of variability in shirt and pant colors even within a single photo of his security detail.
</li><li> Nurses. Even if you see 100 nurses in one day, you will never see two dressed identicaly. Applies to male nurses as well.
<ul><li> Does not, however, apply to nursing students in a hospital. They tend to wear whatever uniform clothes the school requires, usually white.
</li><li> Does not apply to the increasing number of hospitals that are standardizing their dress codes, such that all employees of a certain professional branch (RNs, CNAs, ancillary staff, etc) must wear scrubs of a solid mandated color (frequently either navy or ciel blue). Also does not apply to the OR, where everyone wears the same hospital-issued surgical greens.
<ul><li> An exception is generally made for pediatric nurses, as looking too formal might distress the children.
</li></ul></li><li> If you've seen the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency">Emergency!</a></em>, you may have noticed that although the uniforms may be similar or identical, you'll be hard pressed to find two hats the same. In that time period, nurses wore the hats they wore for their respective schools.
</li><li> To an extent subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHealthService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHealthService">National Health Service</a>. Nurses don't have the various patterns and decorations found elsewhere and have <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nhsidentity.nhs.uk/page/11963/tools-and-resources/nhs-brand-basics/property/uniforms/uniforms">strict uniform guidelines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. And that is just for the logo placement. Doctors, on the other hand, have no real dress code beyond "business casual"; white coats have been largely done away with outside of lab-work, and neckties have been banned as a potential hygeine and safety issue.
</li><li> Priests, somewhat surprisingly, can alter their dress with permission. One Anglican Vicar who worked at a children's hospital was granted permission to dress in colorful shirts (often decorated with cartoon characters) complete with dog collars because he felt that the traditional black was inappropriate for dealing with young children struggling with severe illness.
</li></ul></li><li> 18th century regiments each had their own uniform, and the only criteria was that it should have as much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> as was compatible with marching through mud and potholes, a difficulty usually ignored as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">showiness comes before reason</a>. It may not have mattered as much as it sounds as each block of men only has to know how to fire at the block of men in front of it.
<ul><li> Even colors of uniforms were not standardized as late as the 19th century. The British had troops wearing green (most famously the Green Dragoons and the Rifle regiments) and blue; almost all nations' Zouave uniforms looked alike, in more or less French colors; in the American Civil War, the First Battle of Bull Run saw an incident where a Union unit in gray uniforms got almost on top of the Confederates before either side realized what was going on. (Or was it a Confederate unit in blue?)
<ul><li> It was a Confederate unit in blue running towards a Union artillery unit. The commander on the Union side was asked if they should open fire, but said no because the troops approaching were friendlies. He was wrong.
</li><li> This was brought up in the movie "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", when the leads thought the approaching troops were Confederates in grey, but it turned out to be blue uniforms coated in trail dust.
</li></ul></li><li> Even when a unit's uniforms <em>were</em> standardised when they were formed, it wasn't unusual for them to return home looking vastly different from even other members of the same unit. Admittedly, this was because not all of their uniforms would be from the same supplier using the same batch of dye on the exact same kind of fabric, and so would not necessarily react in the same manner to weather conditions (rain, sun, etc.). A battalion of "redcoats" might end up marching back to barracks after a campaign with some members in pink coats, and some whose jackets were almost brown.
</li></ul></li><li> Various modern incarnations of former paramilitary organisation the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Frontiersmen">Legion of Frontiersmen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tend to have a rather ... random selection of uniform elements.
<ul><li> This is consistenly mocked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">British Armed Forces</a>, who denounce them as "Walts."
</li></ul></li><li> Ditto for modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cossacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cossacks">Cossacks</a>. Their appearance ranges from "fairly modern military style camo" to "authentic 19th century dress uniform complete with a saber", with anything in between possible.
</li><li> Lord Lovet lead a commando brigade on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">D-Day</a> wearing a custom bright white jumper under his battledress, carrying an M1 Carbine.
</li><li> Two examples from sports:
<ul><li> Goalkeepers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">association football</a> must wear uniforms that make them distinguishable from other players. This has occasionally led to customized uniforms.
</li><li> Goaltenders in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a> wear masks attached to their helmets to keep pucks from flying into their faces. These masks and helmets tend to be highly decorated according to the goalie's tastes.
<ul><li> Same with Catchers in Baseball, who wear helmets with face masks for the same reason.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Roman Legions allowed officers to wear their medallions and medals to battle. Each of them wore a custom uniform, here modelled by a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.legionxxiv.org/centurionpage/">few reenactors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Indeed, before the Marian Reforms of 107 BCE, the armies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a> consisted entirely of citizen-soldiers whose arms and armor were their personal property, either bought themselves or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon">inherited</a>, and therefore varied wildly in appearance.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6z2kp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6z2kp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6z2kp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which kinds of weapons and armor were more or less standardized; each class of soldier was expected to have certain kinds of armor and certain types of weapon. For instance, if you were a <em>hastatus</em>, you needed to have decent armor, a shield, two <em>plia</em> (javelins), and a <em>gladius</em> (shortsword). However, what any of these looked like (except perhaps for the <em>plia</em>, which were single-use and may have been made by the State) were up to you and your wallet.</span> Standardization of appearance is a very modern idea.
</li><li> In retail, eateries, and other similar jobs, employees are usually required to wear specific kinds of clothing to conform to the business' standard for appearance. An employee that has more power or seniority over other employees (usually a manager) will have a little more leeway on what they can wear.
