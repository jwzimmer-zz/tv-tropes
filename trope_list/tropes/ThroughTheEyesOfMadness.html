Sure, <em>we</em> see the grotesque tendril moving under the neighbor's skin just like the protagonist does, but who says the camera is telling the truth? Then again, there's never any conclusive proof that he's <em>not</em> a monster either. By their very nature, these stories end without any definite decision as to what was <em>really</em> going on.
</p><p>Compare to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>; in it the Only Sane Man, along with the audience, is sure that the strange thing is real and everyone else just turns a blind eye on it, while this leaves it ambiguous. Another key difference is that trope is often used for comedic effect while this trope is horrific if done properly.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuckooNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuckooNest">Cuckoo Nest</a>, there isn't an "either/or" pair of realities that can be switched between, or a <em>truthful</em> reality waiting to be accessed — just a long, horrible descent into the darkness of the human mind.

If madness gives a person the ability to see real things that others can't, that's a variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness">Power Born of Madness</a>.
</p><p>Very often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneHorror">Mundane Horror</a>, which is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, since many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, add horrifying hallucinatory details to everyday life.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em>, a series directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiKon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiKon">Satoshi Kon</a>, starts off here, with the existence of Lil' Slugger and the sanity of the witnesses and/or victims in extreme doubt. When incontrovertible proof is presented that Lil' Slugger is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">real - but not a real <em>person</em> - and he is most definitely supernatural,</span> that's the signal for things to <em>really</em> go off the rails.
</li><li> Another of Kon's works, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue">Perfect Blue</a></em>, has this among the many tricks it plays with perception and reality. Towards the end, the audience is seeing things through the eyes of <em>two</em> different characters' madness, at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paprika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paprika">Paprika</a></em> is another example. Once again, it's made by Satoshi Kon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an assassin is interrupted by the protagonists, but blows himself up to take out his target</span> Well, actually not. That minute of footage was all from his viewpoint, so he only thought he pulled it off. It's subtle to catch too, reading the revealing line wrong makes it look like there was some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> going on.
</li><li> There was another episode focusing on a pilot fantasizing about assassinating his politician boss. It opens with a shot of him succeeding, then cuts to reveal that they hadn't gotten to the destination that it took place in. The main characters are randomly different people, apparently running a brothel. At the end, they agree that he's not a real threat to anyone's life, as he would never really go through with his assassination plot.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, the effects of the Kishin and the Black Blood are an erosion of sanity. Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the good guys failed to stop the Kishin from reviving, the effect is slowly spreading over the entire world.</span> For examples, there's the kids hallucinations when they come face-to-face with Asura, Eruka and Free having the skin <em>pulled off their faces</em> plus the one where Black Star appears to succeed in stopping Eruka. Maka's hallucination in the Clown chapters is just cruel, twisting a cute flashback into the abrupt 'deaths' of her father and friends. One of the last battles in the series turns this around, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Stein</a> hallucinating that his bloody killing of the enemy forces is, in fact, him 'unwrapping presents' to see what's inside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BoogiepopPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BoogiepopPhantom">Boogiepop Phantom</a></em> plays out like this for the first few episodes (and probably longer than that even...) as most of the time the viewer's in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">WTFland</a> trying to figure out what's real and what's not. Is that guy eating bugs for reals or is it just a sick illusion?
</li><li> The final episodes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> definitely qualify. Were the events of the last two episodes real, or were they all merely taking place in Shinji's shattered psyche? From a literal standpoint, they could of potentially fit in during the closing moments of the Movie. Aside from a few completely minor details, the two endings are compatible with each other. Depending on your interpretation, of course.
</li><li> In <em>The Horror Mansion</em>, the story "The Magic Ball" has an ugly scene at the end that shoves the entire story firmly into this camp. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite previously seeing the hand of Atsuko's baby, indicating that it was a normal human child, we now see it as a monster, just like Mayako's babies... while Atsuko seems to see all the babies as normal. As Atsuko never seemed to have been affected by whatever the Magic Ball had done, this calls our vision of the babies as monsters into doubt. And if we can't trust what we see or read to be what really happened here, how can we know that any of the apparent strange happenings throughout the story were real? The monsters in the well, Isamu's transformation, the bizarre change in attitude of Mayako and Atsuko's parents... it's possible none of it was real.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive">School-Live!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Part of the manga is depicted through Yuki's eyes. The series is set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> but Yuki, who is in serious denial and is delusional, has created a defense mechanism where she sees her desolate, horrific life as a fun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlSeries">Schoolgirl Series</a>.
</li><li> Later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yurii</span> starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">suffering similar symptoms to Yuki</a> and is implied to be hallucinating a teddy bear is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her presumably dead kid sister</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: Most chapters consist of serious, mind-wracking battles that Shirogane and Kaguya go through and their extreme efforts to deny their feelings to themselves and each other. Chapter 50 is the first to reveal that, to an outside party like Kashiwagi, all of the mind games mostly come across as blatant and awkward flirting. No wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">Everyone Can See It</a>.

How much of this was a hallucination caused by drugs, how much is the truth and how much is a lie is never explained.

Joker's flashbacks.... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Are they what actually happened or simply a fabrication of his twisted mind?</a>

Being desperately poor, this marks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> as he agreed to provide to his family by pulling a job for the Red Hood gang. So he kidnaps all the patrons that didn't laugh with him and re-enacts his act with control collars that will kill them when they laugh. The funny thing is that the patrons are really hardcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy">Stand-Up Comedy</a> fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">so they have seen so many acts that nobody remembers the act of a bad comedian</a>.

His main series that debuted in Secret Invasion is a great example, mainly the first issue showing him seeing the people trying to kill him as admiring fans wanting an autograph. He snaps out of it, but it makes you wonder just how reliable his point of view actually is. I mean, <em>he thinks Nick Fury is a talking baby.</em>
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a></em> solo comic depicted her as seeing the world around her as a slapstick cartoon universe in which none of the the violence she commits has serious consequences, while in fact she really is killing and maiming people.

</li><li> <em>Sundowners</em> from Tim Seeley is about a support group for superheroes, or rather, people who <em>think</em> they're superheroes. They each have individual mental and physical disorders which seems to affect their view of the world and causes hallucinations. However, the comic leaves it up for interpretation if they're just ill or if they are indeed fighting against demons and monsters. Even when a scene of them fighting a group of shadowy villains is seen through the eyes of an outsider, where they don't seem to be fighting anything at all, is presented, it's partly implied that the reason they can see these things is <em>because</em> they're mentally ill. There's also the fact that they're all seeing the same things, and some of their so-called hallucinations are given moments of interacting with other people when none of them are present.

A popular fan theory is that Scott is actually a deranged serial killer. The movie also frequently has weird scene transitions (and weird scenes in general) that make it very hard to tell which parts are really happening and which parts are Scott's daydreams/actual dreams. For example, there's one scene where he excuses himself to go to the bathroom. After doing his business as normal, he exits the bathroom, only to find himself in a corridor resembling a school corridor. He follows it to the end to see his own front door, with snow in front of it, and Ramona standing in front of it ringing the doorbell.

</li><li> This is explored in <em>The Return</em>, the final book of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> Rachel from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> series. Rachel is a character who has spent the past forty-seven books devolving from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">Sociopathic Soldier</a>. Consequently, a good chunk of this book focuses on the hallucinations she's experiencing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though, to be fair, a good deal of these hallucinations are induced by Crayak</span>. The books deals with the return of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor">David</a> as well, and she continuously relives conversations she had with David internally. These conversations are shown in a font used nowhere else in the series, perhaps to underscore how badly Rachel is cracking up.

The narrator is a writer named after the author of the novel: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BretEastonEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BretEastonEllis">Bret Easton Ellis</a> who is an unreliable narrator, because he describes things the other characters don't see or feel. The main character is abusing drugs, some of the hallucinations might be to some extent related to that. Also, there is an intertextual reference to Ellis' novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho">American Psycho</a>. </em>Ellis' character has apparently also written a novel titled American Psycho and he says: "Patrick Bateman is an unreliable narrator."

However, he knows he has them (and can usually keep them in control) and there's a valid source for them: a magical ritual to copy knowledge from someone. However, when he learned the ritual, no one mentioned the voices-in-your-head side effect, and coincidentally he doesn't start hearing them until after some incredibly traumatic experiences. By the end of the story, two characters have suggested that he didn't actually copy their personalities into his head, he simply made them up in order to justify doing certain unpleasant things (however one of the characters advancing this idea lives in his head, and the other is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwing</a> telepath).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostRadio">Ghost Radio</a></em>, local DJ Joaquin hosts the titular radio station, where listeners call in to share <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostStory">ghost stories</a> on the air.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShutterIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShutterIsland">Shutter Island</a></em>, the protagonist's viewpoint becomes increasingly inconsistent until the halfway point, where we are first forced to consider the possibility that he is the one who is truly mad. At the very end, it's ambiguous whether he's truly insane, or truly <em>rational</em> for the first time in the entire film and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> choosing lobotomy over living with his crime.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGirlWhoLovedTomGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGirlWhoLovedTomGordon">The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon</a></em> plays this trope with one aspect. The creature that stalks Trisha, and eventually confronts her at the book's climax: is it just a black bear, distorted by her fear and her fever-induced hallucinations? Or is it really the supernatural horror, the "God of the Lost" she imagined it to be as it stalked her, and during her mental duel with it? Just to toy with you, the novel has someone else witness it who seems to provide the objective truth of it being a black bear... then it turns out he thought it was something else for a moment, too, but he's a drunk, and thus no more reliable.
<ul><li> This comes up again in his short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmaresAndDreamscapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmaresAndDreamscapes">The Moving Finger</a>", in which a man believes that he sees a finger sticking up out of his bathroom sink's drain. Things get increasingly weird (and the main character gets increasingly unhinged), until the reader isn't sure what's really going on. The ending suggests one possible 'mundane' explanation, but leaves it ambiguous.
<ul><li> This story can also be read without doubting the narrator, and either way the very end seems to be designed to suggest that it was all real.
</li></ul></li><li> Stephen King explores and discusses the trope more extensively in his short story "The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet". A writer is told a story by his publisher about another writer, struggling with writer's block, who became obsessed with the idea that his typewriter was inhabited by beings who were truly responsible for his writing ability, beings who needed to be appeased with offerings for his continued success. The protagonist indulges what seems like a harmless superstition by leaving an offering for the "Fornits", and gradually spirals into the same delusions. The climax in particular implies either that the writer was actually <em>right,</em> OR had managed to thoroughly delude his wife who had, up until that point, seemed to be a non-believer.
</li><li> King said that the appeal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShining">The Shining</a></em>, for him, was the way that it "blurred the line between the supernatural and the psychotic" — although it seems less blurry than in Kubrick's film version.
</li><li> Implied in some adaptations of King's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a></em>. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">infamous moment</a> where Carrie is humiliated by having pig's blood dumped on her, she thinks the students are all laughing at her, when they've really been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence">shocked into silence.</a> In some adaptations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> Tommy was even calling them out on the prank while this was going on in Carrie's head.
</li><li> King also does this in his short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmaresAndDreamscapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmaresAndDreamscapes">Suffer the Little Children</a>", in which neither the teacher nor the readers are sure if her students are "something else" or not. They seem to confirm their identity to her, but who knows if the words the teacher hears are what was really said?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave">Nick Cave</a>'s <em>And the Ass Saw the Angel</em> is really clever about this. The book quickly establishes the setting as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicRealism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicRealism">Magic Realist</a> one. But then the protagonist turns out to be a pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, and we're left wondering how much is in his head.
</li><li> Truman Capote's short story "Miriam" tells the story of a little girl taking over a middle-aged woman's life. Except that the little girl exists only in the woman's head.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves">House of Leaves</a></em>, Johnny describes in detail how the Minotaur attacks and rips into him, or how he vomits at its stench, only it didn't happen and the creature was never there in the first place. Or was it? The book is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">irritatingly vague</a> about whether the creature exists or Johnny is hallucinating. For certain, Johnny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">descends further and further into insanity</a> as the book progresses.
</li><li> "Young Goodman Brown", by Nathaniel Hawthorne, uses this. Goodman Brown is walking into a forest with the devil to a witch's meeting, at which he sees all the good and prominent people of his Puritan township in unholy worship. He ultimately rejects the devil and the whole thing disappears, leaving the reader and the character unsure of whether or not what he had seen was real. The lack of surety and the constant doubt poison Goodman Brown until he finally dies as a twisted, suspicious, lonely old man.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EvilGeniusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EvilGeniusTrilogy">Evil Genius</a></em> starts out sounding like Cadel is simply paranoid, but then the evidence starts stacking up...
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheYellowWallpaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheYellowWallpaper">The Yellow Wallpaper</a>" describes of a woman who's locked in a room with only the yellow wallpaper to look at, growing more obsessed and insane about it as time goes on. It's semi-autobiographical.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s stories:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRatsInTheWalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRatsInTheWalls">The Rats in the Walls</a>", it is never quite clear whether what's happening to the character is actually happening, actually happened, or whether the character just went insane.

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTemple">The Temple</a></em>, where the narrator is trying to tell his story while constantly pointing out that much of what he is writing is probably just delusions brought on by madness.
</li><li> <em>Hypnos</em> leaves it extremely open whether the narrator's nameless "friend" ever really existed or was simply <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a marble statue he may have found and taken home someday</span> all along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> has a couple long stretches that read like this. Notably, Jonathan's diary entries get like this, especially if read taking into consideration exactly how his sense of time passing has been screwed up. It's definitely a viable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> that the main cast are all pretty cracked.

<ul><li> Waters's earlier novel <em>Affinity</em> also featured a first-person narrator sliding into insanity, though there it's made quite clear at the end what's actually going on.

The narrator describes how for days he's been pursued by his third ex-wife, or maybe it's his second ex-wife, while sometimes interrupting himself to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a> about the death of his first ex-wife or to criticize himself for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a>.

At the beginning he claims that everything he describes "Is true even if it didn't happen."
<ul><li> His narration doubles both as a terrifyingly astute metaphor, and a description of his own view of a reality that was long ago fucked over.

Due to a twist involving the boy who reveals that the Emperor has no clothes, both the narrator (The brother of the Emperor, who is a manipulative, treacherous would-be usurper who's far more incompetent than he realizes) and the reader are left wondering whether the clothes didn't exist, or they really <em>did</em> exist, and the narrator couldn't perceive them because he was wholly unfit for his position.

Season 2 opens up several months later; Fitz is out of his coma and while he does suffer lingering brain damage, Simmons is by his side assisting his recovery as he builds a cloaking device for the team's airplane. Sounds well and fine until the end of the episode, when we learn that Simmons left SHIELD months ago when she felt she was hindering Fitz's recovery, and he has been hallucinating her presence ever since<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16em8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16em8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16em8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In retrospect this is clear: nobody speaks to Simmons and she never leaves his side or does anything unrelated to him</span>.

Since Fitz's greatest fear is that he's more like his Framework persona, the ruthless head of HYDRA known as the Doctor, than he likes to think, it's unsurprising when the Doctor emerges from the rift, has an argument where he calls Fitz weak, and then operates on Daisy to restore her powers against her will, since it's the only way to close the rift and regualar!Fitz is too weak to do it. Only when Gemma bursts in in the middle of the operation do we learn that the Doctor did <em>not</em> emerge from the rift. When he interacts with Fitz, this is happening in Fitz's head <em>the way it has been ever since he left the Framework</em>. When he interacts with others, it's just Fitz, who has let the Doctor persona take over to do "what needs to be done".

We then see flashbacks of Andre and Pamela's scenes together throughout the season. When they were on a date, Pamela told him to not to talk so loudly because people were starting to stare; in reality, they were staring because he was talking to himself in the middle of the restaurant.

She wrestles the attacker down and calls for security. Just as you're wondering what's taking security so long to get there, the camera shifts and it turns out she's in sickbay, having never left after her initial exam in the first place.

Thus, we, the genre-audience, start to believe that Arthur has invented The Tick and we're seeing another of Arthur's hallucinations - and by the second episode, Arthur comes to that realization himself, too... incorrectly.

The protagonist Ryan sees Wilfred not as a dog, but a man in a dog costume. Often, even though Ryan generally looks after Wilfred for a neighbor, the viewer can't always be sure if Wilfred's really there or not. And Ryan once spent an entire episode hallucinating in his basement, during which Wilfred and a passing stranger (who isn't really there at all) put him through various games. In another, Wilfred allegedly sneaks hallucinogenic drugs into his tea. This becomes a bit of fridge horror when one considers that Wilfred really is just a dog, meaning Ryan likely drugged it himself without even knowing. During the resulting drug trip, Wilfred murders Ryan's "spirit guide" to prevent Ryan discovering the truth about who/what/why Wilfred is. And in a recent episode, it's suggested Ryan somehow set himself up to be framed for mass money fraud without being aware and blaming it on Wilfred (it turns out Ryan's girlfriend was out of her mind and did it herself at the instruction of her own Wilfred hallucination - this one French). Couple all of this with the series' many dips into Ryan's past, revealing many dark and traumatic aspects of his life and psyche, and it can be very difficult to figure out which parts of episodes are real and which parts are just in Ryan's mind.

To further fit this trope, both Mulder and Scully seem to have had the exact same "plot" to their hallucinations, which is pointed out as impossible in the actual episode.

</li><li> Similarly, there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JAGSWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JAGSWonderland">JAGS Wonderland</a></em>. So you've started hallucinating and hearing voices — perhaps you're schizophrenic. No, wait, you're not schizophrenic — you've got this disease called Cyclic Psychoaffective Disorder. None of the medical professionals like to talk about it, because you can physically interact with the hallucinations... and it's contagious. No, wait, those aren't hallucinations — they're the things that operate on the lower levels of reality. You're not losing your grip on reality; <em>reality</em> is losing its grip on <em>you</em>.

</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Theatre </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Shakespeare's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> is perfect for this as the entire play is driven by Hamlet seeing a ghost of his dead father telling Hamlet that his uncle, the king's brother, is a murderer. The play then goes on to make Hamlet seem as insane as possible while still keeping everything the ghost said plausible, yet never confirmed.
<ul><li> The guards see the ghost before Hamlet does, although it never speaks to them and never confirms its existence to anyone but Hamlet. Hamlet, at the urging of Horatio (essentially the sanest person in the play), goes out to meet the ghost alone, and only then does it speak. Indeed, later in the play the ghost appears to Hamlet while his mother is with him and only Hamlet can see the ghost. The only person in the play who has solid evidence that there is a ghost is Hamlet, and he very well could be mad as a hatter.
</li><li> It probably doesn't help that the oldest version we have of the story is from a time where, really, it was perfectly acceptable to believe in ghosts, and Hamlet (or, rather, the character Hamlet is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of) was a fine cocktail of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Mental Illness</a> and badass in a Viking shell, who survives his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>.
</li><li> And of course, whether Hamlet really is mad and/or is just "putting an antic disposition on" has been the subject of massive debate for a couple hundred years. A convincing textual argument can really be made for either, or both. His supposed madness is even lampshaded. Hamlet wonders if the ghost he saw was a hallucination, or a demon sent to him to trick him. He tests this theory out by attempting to make his uncle feel guilty for the murder the ghost described to him. How does he do it? He talks some actors, who are hired to put on a play for the royalty, to modify the murder scene so that it more closely resembled his father's supposed death. His uncle tested positive, making it harder for audiences to argue that Hamlet was simply mad.
</li></ul></li><li> A better example might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">the Scottish play</a>, where Banquo's ghost torments MacBeth. Some directors leave the ghost out of scene, leaving us to wonder whether the ghost exists or he's just going mad. As nobody else can see it when it is there, he probably is anyway (the hallucinatory dagger was probably the first sign). On the other hand, the man definitely <em>does</em> have witches screwing with his life; he can't have hallucinated them, since Banquo saw them too (although it is sometimes suggested that they were only real the first time he saw them, and that the other encounters were madness-induced hallucinations).
</li><li> Some productions of <em>Wozyeck</em> designed the setting this way.
</li><li> The 2012 French play <em>Le Père</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0x6o7');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0x6o7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0x6o7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>The Father</em></span> (translated into English in 2014) is told from the point of view of an elderly man succumbing to dementia.

The problem is... it's unclear to her whether or not her quest is even real, much less her traveling companions. A possible interpretation of what's going on is that aside from meeting her party, the entire quest is a giant delusion of a girl hoping to feel important because her birth parents abandoned her.
</li><li> P.I. Douglas Reilly in <em>PataNoir</em> is off of his (unspecified) medication - because he "works better" without it - and therefore has a somewhat more literal view of metaphors than most people. If the text says that a cigarette butt is smoking like the embers of a dying fire, Reilly can (apparently) <em>pick up one of the embers</em> and use it to warm up a potential client who's been acting coldly toward him.
</li><li> This trope is the main source of horror in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phantasmagoria2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phantasmagoria2">Phantasmagoria 2</a>: A Puzzle of Flesh</em>. The main character was recently released from a mental institution, and throughout the game sees and hears horrific things that no one else seems to notice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal">Postal</a></em> casts the player as a stressed employee turned paranoid delusional who goes on a horrific rampage. And why does he do this, you may ask? While it's probably all about revenge subconsciously, he's deluded himself into believing that the town he lives in must be terminated because its inhabitants are insane. Talk about projection.
<ul><li> <em>Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend</em> plays with this trope. The game takes place after the Postal Dude has suffered a gunshot wound to the head at the end of <em>Postal 2</em>, and as a result he often finds himself transported to a <em>Silent Hill</em>-like "alternate reality" version of his current location, where the walls are made of blood and Gary Coleman-like demons appear and attack him. It's probably just a head-trauma-induced hallucination, though. Probably. Postal Dude even remarks "With my luck, that's really a nun. Or someone's grandmother." after blowing away one of the demons with his firearms; being the guy he is, though, he follows this up with "but there's no sense in taking chances".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> runs on this trope, with it becoming increasingly clear that the town is showing the characters things only they can see. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game ends with the revelation that Mary didnt die three years ago; James killed her recently and has been trying to convince himself otherwise. The letter he received slowly disappears throughout the game, implying that it was just another part of Jamess delusions. Maria is likewise revealed to be created from Jamess conflicted feelings about seeing Mary again.</span> It is also made clear that Angela and Eddie are seeing a different town than James, and that Laura, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">being a child</a>, doesnt see anything supernatural. Finally, this trope is implied with even more horrific implications when returning to the area where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">James killed his first monster. You will find it blocked off by police tape, raising the question of just what exactly James bludgeoned to death with a wooden plank.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> raises the possibility that it's an example of the trope, with a character first angrily decrying ("You come here and enjoy spilling their blood and listening to them cry out! You feel excited when you step on them, snuffing out their lives!"), then shockedly asking the game's protagonist, regarding the creatures she's fought and killed for the whole game, "Monsters? They looked like monsters to you?" He claims to have just been kidding... but he may have been just saying that to calm her down and the monsters were just her mysticism-addled visions of innocent bystanders... but then again, maybe he really was just kidding.

The therapy sessions are played from Cheryls point of view in the real world, while Harry's sections take place in Cheryl's mind.

The protagonist is eventually overwhelmed by the horrors of Dubai, up to and including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">forty-seven civilians he took it upon himself to try to rescue burning to death because of a white phosphorus attack that he was responsible for launching</span>; after this point, he starts imagining things, and the player isn't privy to what's real and what's in his head. At least twice, the game blatantly telegraphs that this is going on, but the clues leave out just <em>how</em> far gone he is until the ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Really</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">really</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">far</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em> is very much built around this trope. On the one hand, there's definitely monsters tearin' shit up. On the other hand, the main character, Torque, is definitely out of his damn mind. On top of the constant hallucinations, he can transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">a hideous monster</a> that does excellent melee damage to foes, but suffers from health damage if used for too long. It's eventually revealed that Torque only <em>imagines</em> his transformation and the weird attacks he uses while in the form of the monster: it's all just him slaughtering people with his bare hands. This becomes very obvious when other characters react with surprise at how many enemies Torque killed while transformed, but never seem to notice any physical change.

<ul><li> In-game you can give <em>yourself</em> eyes of madness by wearing the "Pyrovision Goggles"; eyewear that make (supported) maps bright pastel in color, replace shouts of pain with laughing, makes everyone voice's high-pitched, and replaces messages of one player dominating the other with ones saying they're becoming friends.
</li><li> In the comics, it's shown that Pyro views anything that isn't on fire or otherwise being subjected to violence and mayhem as being dreadfully dull, boring, and colorless. It's only once they start burning things, or see things being burnt, that any joy or happiness can be perceived.

All dialogue in the game plays differently as a Malkavian than as other clans, and among other lovely perks, you can have thoughtful discussions with TV sets and road signs, and realize in unholy terror that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cabbie that has been driving you around LA is actually <em>Caine the Original Freaking Vampire</em></span>! Or is he?
<ul><li> Malkavian vampires were known for their insight as well in the table-top game Bloodlines was inspired by, and this was carried over. As a result, the character can talk to another mad character, the two of them can blithely explain the entire plot to the player in their babble, and then the protagonist can basically say, "Well, time to go fulfill the plot," and go off to do it. None of it will make sense until the very end of the game.

However, after being sent home from work after passing out during a physical, the family confronts him about his weight issue and state that he is really anorexic. At that point, it's revealed Stan wasn't getting fatter, he was suffering from a delusional state of mind and lost so much weight he was practically a walking skeleton.

</li><li> Outsider art is, for better or worse, generally considered to be this, since it is usually created by individuals with various mental illnesses, the most common one being paranoid schizophrenia. Drawings and paintings created by individuals with schizophrenia are often interpreted as being representative of their own distorted perception of reality, although historically it's only the most severe cases that are reflected. One outsider artist, August Natterer, had a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia that started with a debilitating hallucination he suffered where he reportedly saw thousands of allegedly prophetic images of Revelations in an hour. All of his paintings after that point were of his various hallucinations.
