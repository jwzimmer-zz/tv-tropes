<p>This trope is when a character is made nicer (or at least a bit more sympathetic) in an adaptation than they were in the source material. For instance, a character who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> in the source material becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> or even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> in the adaptation of said material.
</p><p>While there may be <em>some</em> overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>, the key difference is that the character doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">necessarily become heroic</a> if they were villainous or neutral in the source material, and doesn't make them more heroic if they were heroic in the first place. Characters affected by this trope will generally stay on their respective alignments (whether good, evil, or neutral), but they will become a bit more approachable in the adaptation.

<ul><li> In Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> movie, Tinkerbell is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">overly jealous</a> about Peter and has a temper. To make her a more likable and more rounded protagonist, in the sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyFairies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyFairies">Disney Fairies</a></em> she is a sweet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Plucky Girl</a> instead.
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a>'s father Jefferson Morales, and his uncle/Jeff's brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProwlerMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProwlerMarvelComics">Aaron Davis</a>:
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comics, Aaron is introduced as a greedy bastard who only sees his nephew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a> as a means to an end, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies cursing Miles. With that said, it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath">Comic Book Death</a>, and in his second shot at life, Aaron has worked to be a better man, with varying degrees of success.</span> His incarnations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a></em>, while still criminals, genuinely love Miles. In <em>Homecoming</em>, Aaron informs Peter of a meeting between the Vulture's gang and Mac Gargan because he didn't want Toomes's weapons on the street where they could hurt Miles, and in <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he becomes horrified when he realizes he's been trying to murder Miles, resulting in his boss Wilson Fisk fatally shooting him for refusing to kill Miles</span>.
</li><li> In the <em>Ultimate</em> comics, Jefferson started off despising anyone with superpowers, only warming up to Spider-Man <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">some time after learning that he's Miles</span>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelsSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelsSpiderMan">Marvel's Spider-Man</a></em>, he's supportive of both Peter and Miles right out of the gate, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4">Spider-Man (PS4)</a></em> not only sees Jeff supportive of Spidey, but gladly working with him. It's also worth mentioning that in the PS4 version of the story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jefferson supplants Peter Parker as the heroic figure who dies tragically and motivates Miles towards heroism</span>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse">Into the Spider-Verse</a></em>, Jefferson's dislike of Spider-Man is only due to the latter being a vigilante who interferes with Jeff's work as a cop, rather than any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he clearly feels bad about the death of his universe's Peter; and ends up willing to work with Miles's Spidey at the end</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em> tend to downplay or outright omit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX">Professor X</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulative</a> streak and portray him as more of a saintly, benevolent father figure, in contrast to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a> he is in the comics. He's still a father figure to most of the X-Men in the source material, albeit one that's a bit more "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">prickly</a>" most of the time. They also tend to omit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent">his infatuation</a> with his student <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> (who was underage at the time), though that plot point was largely dropped from the comics after the Silver Age, save for in the alternate universe <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em> series.
</li><li> The protagonist of the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LogansRun">Logan's Run</a></em> was a ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional">Consummate Professional</a> who had no problems killing people in brutal ways, and was initially motivated to find the Runner Sanctuary in order to die a legend for destroying it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun">film</a> toned it down to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>; Logan would use lethal force, but was drafted into the job of finding Sanctuary and turned against his society when he found out that life past thirty was possible. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LogansRun">TV series</a> softens the character further to a soft-spoken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">Hitman with a Heart</a> who had come to be disturbed by his profession and was questioning his society well before his decision to throw his lot in with Jess.
</li><li> Many versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> have had his worst attributes downplayed. Tellingly, out of these versions, the one for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> is the <em>only one</em> of the Joker listed here that is currently one of the many Jokers listed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a>, whereas the others don't meet the qualifications to be listed there.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad (2016)</a></em> version of the Joker actually seems to genuinely care for Harley and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even pushing her out of a helicopter to save her life when he goes crashing, though Joker being Joker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">he survives</a></span>. Note that this was a deliberate choice made to soften the film during reshoots, as the original cut of the movie apparently depicted the Joker's treatment of Harley in a much more negative and abusive light.
</li><li> While he'll still lash out at Harley and leave her to rot, the Joker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> isn't physically abusive to Harley and he shows her more genuine affection such as stealing a diamond the size of a softball for a Valentine's Day gift, something his DCAU counterpart would consider a waste of time. Additionally, while he's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Faux Affably Evil</a>, he's more affable than usual.
</li><li> The Joker seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em> genuinely respected the Weeper and wanted to team-up with him; didn't seem to be abusive to Harley; and during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with Batman, he (begrudgingly) saved a child.
</li><li> The Joker — or as he's currently known in season 1, John Doe — of all people gets this treatment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries">Batman: The Telltale Series</a></em>. He seems to genuinely consider Bruce his friend, and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles">Swapped Roles</a> with Harley Quinn in that he's the one in love with her while she just finds him annoying. At the end of the second episode of the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if Harley is left behind, John will be visibly distressed, and demand to go back to help her.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em> sees its version of the titular Clown Prince of Crime, Arthur Fleck, nowhere near as monstrous as other Jokers, starting off as a well-meaning man in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> so damaging, it forces him to retreat into his mental issues. Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">outside of the Arkham doctor at the end</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">all of the people he killed wronged him</a> and he even spared former co-worker Gray <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">because he was the only one at his old job who was nice to him</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Word of Saint Paul</a> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="urllink" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/joker-cinematographer-interview/2/">Sophie also survived<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>, whereas other Jokers would've killed them both just for the hell of it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> manga from Monkey Punch, the title character was a coldblooded murderer with a penchant for raping beautiful women. Beginning with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s run on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket">the original 70s TV show</a>, Lupin has been softened to varying degrees. While he's still willing to use lethal force, it's almost always against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">other, WORSE criminals</a>, and usually only in self-defense to begin with. He's also never depicted as a rapist in these adaptations, even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> ones that otherwise veer a little closer to the original manga, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIITheWomanCalledFujikoMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIITheWomanCalledFujikoMine">The Woman Called Fujiko Mine</a></em>. The adaptations also have a habit of giving Lupin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments where he goes out of his way to rescue innocent people who are being victimized (most famously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a></em>), another trait that would seem severely out of character for Monkey Punch's depiction of the character.
</li><li> Like the Joker, many versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> have downplayed his worst aspects. While Osborn only became his most nasty (including being depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Neo-Nazi</a>) post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em>, even before then, he's had some skeletons in the closest, including framing Mendel Stromm.

In the original novel and manga, she not only scapegoats Misaki, but also takes Sakakibara to task.

She was also quite the leech, tending to get in the way of their work and showing no gratitude for how much they did for her. However, she gradually comes to understand her position and tries to be better. In the anime, they downplay her entitled behavior and almost completely eliminate her distaste for the poor hygiene, which makes her look less stuck up.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>.
<ul><li> Jiren's heroic traits are much more clearly shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper">manga</a> version of <em>Super</em> where he is first introduced into stopping a criminal riot and saves the other Pride Troopers from a monster they were struggling on, even postponing a talk with his leader until all the citizens are safe. He is also unwilling to join the Tournament of Power since that would mean the erasure of 7 other universes and only relents when Belmod offers him a wish from the Super Dragon Balls but even then, he is fully willing to withdraw if there is any trouble that happens in the universe. This is in contrast to how is represented in the anime where all we know of him is that he is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a> who does not hesitate to show them just how superior he is to everyone, doesn't seem to care for his comrades when they are defeated, insulting his leader for his less-than-stellar performance and even tries to murder all of Goku's friends and family just to spite him.
</li><li> In the manga and the original Japanese version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> anime, Vegeta is a bloodthirsty, amoral villain who slowly develops into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Nominal Hero</a>, and then an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. In some English dubs of the anime, while he's still <em>definitely</em> a bad guy at first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubText">Dub Text</a> makes him more pragmatic and less sadistic, to the point where he even makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a> offer to Goku. The dub of the Namek arc even gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> (that he was raised by Freeza to be evil with no choice in the matter), which he didn't have in the original. From that point on in the dubbed version, he's more of a straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>.
</li><li> Goku himself. The English dub tends to play-up his heroic side while somewhat downplaying his less noble aspects that are present in the Japanese version. A prominent example is after the fight with Vegeta during the Saiyan Saga, when Goku convinces Krillin to spare Vegeta's life; in most versions of the English dub, Goku invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him</a> while also wanting to give Vegeta the same chance for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> that Piccolo got, whereas in the original Japanese, Goku does so only because he found the fight with Vegeta exciting and wanted to fight him again even at the risk of the Earth's safety, which he openly admits is a selfish desire.
</li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/03/27/new-interview-translations-akira-toriyama-special-talks/">Toriyama<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> this holds true even for the original Japanese anime. He was dissatisfied by the righteous hero-type portrayal the anime gave him. In the manga, Goku is supposed to be depicted as someone who doesn't fight for others, but fights for himself to get stronger. He wanted to depict someone who isn't a classic hero and can even be seen as not being a good person because of his selfish desire (a little bit of poison that sneaks through his character as Toriyama puts it). However, even going purely off the manga, this depiction of Goku is lost in translation since most of Goku's motives still nonetheless pertain to protecting or avenging his family and friends, and he does help people he barely knows when it didn't completely relate to fighting; like storming Muscle Tower to repay Suno for saving him from freezing to death and avenging Upa's father who was murdered by Tao before taking down the Red Ribbon Army, and getting the Dragon Balls to revive him. He wanted to fight the Saiyans not because they were powerful, but because they were going to murder everyone he knew. He didn't want to help fight Buu, despite having the power to do so, because he didn't want his friends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">depend on him to save them</a>, which if he was completely selfish he wouldn't care and fight Buu for the sake of having a good battle. It could be said that Toriyama's original intentions for Goku ended up evolving into something slightly different as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> took over. Basically, Goku is a hero who at his core has a good, kind heart that cares for others and wants to protect them, but he also has selfish personal motives that can override his better judgement. Goku even sums this up to 17 by saying that he isn't fully aware that he's saving the world, he just wants to fight strong people. However, he can't stand by and watch others suffer.
</li><li> Chi-Chi actually gets this to in the anime, in the manga while she of course still loves her husband and sons Toriyama still puts more focus on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> towards Goku with even Master Roshi joking that Goku is refusing to come back to earth because hes scared of his wife. In the anime its made very clear Chi-Chi adores Goku as seen when he recovers from the heart virus and she runs into his arms crying with joy before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwirlOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwirlOfLove">he spins her around</a>. This scene does not exist in the manga. Unfortunately <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">inverts</a> this bringing Chi-Chi back to full angry housewife mode whose more willingly to painfully armlock her husband and ignores the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> she had in the Buu Saga like how she was the one who trained Goten in marital arts.

In the <em>Minus</em> and <em>Broly</em> version hes much softer being the Saiyan equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyMan">Family Man</a> who personally makes sure Goku leaves Planet Vegeta before Frieza destroys it.

<ul><li> Ryuji is already a good person, but unlike in the game, he doesn't threaten Ren out of fear of being ratted out to Kamoshida. Before going to Kamoshida's Palace for the third time, he doesn't yell at Ann to stay out, even if his intention was to make sure she didn't put herself in danger. Also, when Morgana left as a result of his insecurities, Ryuji is the most concerned and tries to genuinely apologize for calling him useless, whereas in the game, he was forced to do it, and the backhanded nature of his apology ended up protracting the conflict.
</li><li> Sojiro is a lot less harsh with Ren in his first appearance and reprimands him far less harshly after his first day at school. He also doesn't need to be convinced to let Ren keep Morgana like he did in the game, despite the fact that as the owner of a café, he has a legitimate reason to not want a pet. Later, when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finds Futaba's calling card</span>, he waits until they've both calmed down from the initial shock before discussing it with her and Ren in a very polite, civil manner, unlike the game where his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">Anger Born of Worry</a> causes Futaba to break down in tears.

</li><li> During the food buffet scene in Episode 5, Ann does not briefly lash out at Ren and Ryuji like in the game, since she's more hurt than angry as over the incident. Instead, the three reasonably talk things out concerning the adults' mistreatment of them. Ann is not as resentful towards Makoto as in the game, and more readily admits that she couldn't do anything for Shiho, either.
</li><li> Yusuke doesn't blackmail the Phantom Thieves with trespassing charges in order to get Ann to pose nude for him.

</li><li> Eiko in Makoto's Confidant. In the game, she gets angry with Makoto after Makoto tries to convince her to break up with Tsukasa, mistakenly believing that Makoto wants to steal Tsukasa from her, and is cold toward Makoto the next time they meet. In the anime, she simply asks Makoto for money and repeats her request when Makoto finds her in Shinjuku. While in the game, Eiko's last heard from when Makoto mentions that they made up at the start of the Rank 10 event, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the anime, she proceeds to post Tsukasa's misdeeds to the Phan-Site, turning Tsukasa into a Mementos target.

</li><li> Several of the Shadows end up being downplayed examples:
<ul><li> In the game, Shadow Kaneshiro's final warning about Black Mask sounds like he's taunting the Phantom Thieves; in the anime, it sounds more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsDyingGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsDyingGrace">Villain's Dying Grace</a>.
</li><li> Shadow Kunikazu in particular is a much more sympathetic character. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the game, he merely mourns his utopia with his dying words, but in the anime, he dies with tears in his eyes, lamenting that he'll never get to rekindle his relationship with Haru. Additionally, in flashbacks, Kunikazu was shown to be at least happy during his father's time as a kind cafe owner, and when the happy customers came to offer flowers for the shop's closing, he was crying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy">Tears of Joy</a> from the compliments of the customer before he started going down a dark path.

Dark-type Pokémon (which includes the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotZilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotZilla">Tyranitar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Hydreigon</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Hoopa Unbound</a>) get hit with this more often than not.
</li><li> Clair's anime personality is far nicer than her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> game one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">complimenting Ash mid-battle</a> and not showing any of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">Sore Loser</a> moments like in the game.
</li><li> Ditto with Pike Queen Lucy, who is portrayed in the anime as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofDarkHairedGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofDarkHairedGirl">Aloof Dark-Haired Girl</a>, but overall rather nice and friendly. This could be attributed to her being attracted to Brock, though.
</li><li> This happens with Gladion:
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> games, Gladion is an enforcer for Team Skull who is incredibly abrasive in conversation and a perfectionist in battle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to being disowned by Lusamine as a result of not wanting to follow her example</span>. While his counterpart in the <em>Sun and Moon</em> series has shades of these traits, he is also shown to have a more noble attitude towards his relationships with people; such as treating Ash in a more friendly manner and fighting off Team Rocket and the recurring Team Skull grunts.
</li><li> He also doesn't seem to have any relation to Team Skull and has a different reason for running away from home, which may imply the anime version of the character may be an even more morally-gray rival than his video game counterpart.

In the main continuity, Charmander lost his respect and loyalty towards Ash when he evolved into Charmeleon and it takes a long time for Ash to earn his respect again. In <em>I Choose You</em>, he keeps his friendly personality even after evolving. On Pikachu's part, he kept his original personality from before the Spearow attack, however he lost most of his other bratty or jerkish moments from the Original Series. Ash's personality in the film also doesn't resemble his personality during the Kanto arc. He lacks Ash's brattier and more immature elements that disappeared after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Instead he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackportedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackportedDevelopment">more like his Hoenn or Sinnoh character</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens with Silver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>. His game counterpart from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em> is the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> rival thus far, literally pushes you around, and is mean to his Pokemon prior to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Silver in the manga is aloof but not as confrontational or aggressive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a></em>, Elina Vance is one of the most jerkassy of all the jerkass characters in the series, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> for her sister Leina and treats everyone else like dirt, especially those who are of lower class. In the <em>Queen's Blade Unlimited</em> OVA, she is much, much nicer, and it's easy to see it. She still holds a high opinion of Leina but it's much more subdued, and she is shown treating commoners more decently.
</li><li> In the original manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Ranma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">other suitors</a> are treated as fairly generic villain characters—if not from the start, then they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">rapidly devolve into it</a>. In the anime version, Shampoo, Ukyo and Kodachi all receive a much softer touch and are presented in a more positive light—they still do many villainous things, but there is a much greater emphasis on the sincerity of their feelings for Ranma, and they also get to show off more benevolent, even heroic, sides to themselves. Shampoo is shown doing things like being willing to put her life on the line for Ranma's sake, and helping him train to overcome Happosai even without any stake in the matter, whilst Kodachi shows a genuine kindness and desire to help Ranma that would be unthinkable for the lunatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLoveInterest">Self-Proclaimed Love Interest</a> of the manga.
</li><li> Naofumi Iwatani from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheRisingOfTheShieldHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheRisingOfTheShieldHero">The Rising of the Shield Hero</a></em> is far less embittered and angry about everything in the manga, and more prone to acting light-hearted. The anime makes him come across as overall a better person due to not being able to truly adapt his internal thoughts and views on people like the original Light Novel did. Taking this full circle, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">instead of demanding for the King and Malty's execution when they were finally exposed, he has their names forcibly changed as an act of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">Cruel Mercy</a>, mostly to spare the Queen from being forced to execute her husband and eldest daughter.</span>
</li><li> Inner Moka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em> was a very prideful piece of work and it took a long time for anyone to get on her good side, especially Tsukune. In the anime, she warms up to everyone much quicker and her remembering all the good Tsukune did for her Outer Self motivates her to save him from being executed by Kuyou. She since puts on more of an effort to get along with everyone and also lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched">haphephobia</a> of her manga counterpart, making her every bit as touchy-feely as her love rivals.

<ul><li> Sailors Uranus and Neptune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em> are nowhere near as antagonistic towards in the Inner Senshi like they were in the original anime despite remaining prideful overall. In the end of the Death Busters story arc, they outright attempt to kill Sailor Moon because they couldn't stand her idealism, forcing Sailor Moon to outsmart them before they admitted defeat. In <em>Crystal</em>, no such thing happens and they part ways from the Inners on peaceful terms.
</li><li> Professor Tomoe was a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> in the manga, happily experimenting on his daughter Hotaru and serving Pharaoh 90 without any remorse. The classic anime instead gave him a tragic backstory of his wife being killed in a lab experiment and Tomoe trying to find a cure for Hotaru's condition, this being his only reason for working with Pharaoh 90.

To avoid spoiling <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Megu-nee's death</span> the anime removed all of Miki's confrontations with Yuki and Rii early on, making her a far more subdued character.

He also acted like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> towards his brother, Magnus the Red, because of his deep hatred and distrust of psykers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> in general. Here, Fanged Paw, Russ's Codexverse counterpart, would still have an extremely strained relationship with Crimson Star, but would soon realize the error of his ways after taking his hatred too far and getting himself exiled from the Terran Empire as punishment. Once he achieved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and his exile ended, Fanged Paw would come back an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Alicorn</a> and enjoy a happy (albeit vitriolic) relationship with Crimson Star after they reconciled as brothers.
</li><li> Magnus the Red was too, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> who preferred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">shift the blame on others instead of acknowledging his own flaws and mistakes</a>, which is what partially and ultimately led to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turning to Chaos</a> (among other things). Crimson Star, who was based on Magnus, was broken out of his behavior when he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">completely blinded</a> saving a classmate in a carriage accident, and ultimately became a heroic and benevolent character thanks to the positive influence of his friends and loved ones.
</li><li> Lorgar pre-Horus Heresy was a very altruistic, kind, and religiously devout man... but he also idolized the Emperor of Mankind and worshiped him as a god to excessive degrees.

Here, as Written Word, he has no such behavior, due to Golden Scepter being a good father and finding better ways to curb his son's nastier behavioral traits, as well as show him the true folly of his religious worship.

In this story, his sister, Lena, was one of the victims of Metropolis' destruction during Superman's fight with Zod, so Luthor wants revenge for her death and genuinely sees Superman as a threat to the world.

Cool, calm and collected, and almost resigned to his new base body. He also seems to genuinely be friends with Neo, having apparently learned ASL to communicate with her.

The worst thing he does is lash out at Phil for trying to warn him about Meg being in league with Hades, but he immediately comes to regret that.
</li><li> As mentioned before, most of Hercules' original flaws came from his rage curse inflicted on him by Hera, who did this out of revenge against Zeus.

</li></ul></li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice">A Silent Voice</a></em> had to remove a lot of scenes and elements in order to fit the story into such a short timespan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kawai</span> in the manga is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademicAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademicAlphaBitch">Academic Alpha Bitch</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">narcissist</a>, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satoshi</span> is a violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter">Bully Hunter</a>. The film had to tone down or remove these elements.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers">Ultimate Avengers</a></em> movies have several examples:
<ul><li> The films notably soften the character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a>. While he's very impulsive, egotistical and hotheaded, he's not a violent, unstable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuser</a> like he was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a></em>. In fact, his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheWasp">Jan</a> is <em>far</em> less volatile here, and he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">dies a hero</a> in the second film, in contrast to the comics, where he was kicked off the team in disgrace after the other Ultimates found out what he did to his wife</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a>, having the appearance and backstory of his Ultimate counterpart, but with a personality much closer to the classic, mainstream Cap. Thus, he's depicted as an optimistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">Cape</a> who believes in America's ideals, rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">a sexist, racist, homophobic bully</a> like he was in <em>The Ultimates</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> is still shady and secretive, but is far less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> than his Ultimate counterpart.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>White Fang (2018)</em>:
<ul><li> The titular wolf-dog from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteFang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteFang">the novel</a> endures a lot of abuse, becoming a twisted and angry animal before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> transforms him. The 2018 movie has him be more heroic, the abuse from Beauty Smith making him wary of kind humans at first before bonding quickly with Weedon Scott and his wife. He also learns from Kiche that helping the people in the Native American village brings positive reinforcement, so he works very hard to earn their trust.
</li><li> Gray Beaver gets this too. In the novel, he's stern at best towards White Fang and beats him at worst for misbehaving. He even gives White Fang away to Beauty Smith due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">addicted to alcohol</a> (as Beauty Smith had planned). In the 2018 movie, he's a kinder man who encourages White Fang to try his best, and he only gives White Fang to Beauty Smith (and gives away Kiche earlier) in exchange for money to save his tribe's land.

However, the film Floyd Lawton, while still nihilistic, avoids hurting women and children, even going after other criminals.
</li><li> While he enjoys conflict, Captain Boomerang isn't actively provoking people like he does in the comics. The film also downplays his racism, misogyny, and homophobia, which were frequent sources of tension in the original series — However, the racism and misogyny <em>was</em> meant to be included in the form of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> fixation on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Katana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Katana">Katana</a>, it just got cut from the movie.

In the movies, many of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moments are removed and others are made more justified by the circumstances. Because of this, Greg's rivals (Patty, Chirag) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">act worse</a> in order to make Greg's actions more understandable.

</li><li> Holly Hills is a borderline example. In the books, she's only seen from afar, since Greg was never able to directly talk to her, but she generally seems like she preferred her own social circle, only seen interacting with Greg once and that backfired <em>horribly</em>. In the movies, she's a <em>lot</em> more social, bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>, and actually returns Greg's affections.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elektra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elektra">Elektra</a></em>, Stick is a nicer, more caring person than the cynical hustler who put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Matt</a> through Hell while training him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Due to the compressed nature of the film adaptations, several of the meaner moments of Severus Snape are cut, making him look more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a>, rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a>.
</li><li> There are a few of these in the film adaptation of <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em>, Barty Crouch Sr. has been described as a very stern and serious man, who, in his heyday as head of magical law enforcement, was known for his merciless approach towards Death Eaters and his ceaseless ambition. He would even sentence <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own son</span> to life imprisonment to further his career. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">film version</a>, he comes over as a slightly socially awkward but amicable man, who even engages in a friendly conversation with Harry after the latter succeeds at the Second Triwizard Task. Film Barty is also shown to be emotionally devastated when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his son</span> is revealed to be a Death Eather, while his book counterpart shows nothing but contempt and hatred for him.
</li><li> Amos Diggory, a boastful and impolite man in the books, portrayed as much more quiet and amicable; he does not boast about Cedric in any way and when he meets Harry, Amos is very pleased and shakes his hand happily, never once giving Harry a hard time.
</li><li> A minor one for Draco and his Slytherin crew. In the book they talk disrespectfully throughout Dumbledore's eulogy for Cedric. In the film<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note48lfu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note48lfu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note48lfu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> sitting behind Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs</span>, they're just as silent and solemn as everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> Fleur's initial persona in the books is coming across as haughty and rude, before she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">Took a Level in Kindness</a> when Harry tried to save her sister in the Second Task. And even when she stays at the Burrow before her wedding to Bill, she openly complains about how boring it is. In the film she just comes across as a bit aloof before thanking Harry, and the scenes at the Burrow are removed. Additionally the films cut out her being part Veela and using her powers to seduce a couple of the boys.
</li><li> Similar to Snape, several of the more morally questionable acts of Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour aren't shown in the films. In the books, it is frequently said Scrimgeour acts ruthlessly to give the populace the illusion the Ministry is successful in the fight against the Death Eaters. He also butts heads with Harry on several occasions, desiring him to become the Ministry's poster child, which Harry disagrees with. In the films, the above is never brought up and the only time he's seen interacting with Harry is when he hands over Dumbledore's will. This conversation also doesn't almost escalate into a fight, as it does in the books.
</li><li> Cornelius Fudge's role in the films hasn't exactly changed, but he doesn't appear to be as harsh as in the books due to many scenes involving him being altered or removed. His role in the <em>Goblet of Fire</em> film merely boils down to him not wanting to cancel the Triwizard Tournament so people won't see him as a coward, and his conflict with Harry and Dumbledore in <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> is toned down due to several interactions with them not being shown.
</li><li> Hermione's stubborn arrogance and ruthlessness are also greatly toned down in the movies.
</li><li> Sirius Black counts as this in the film adaptation of <em>Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix</em> where he shows Harry concern and even comforts him after seeing Voldemort's snake Nagini attack Arthur Weasley, while in the book there are a few times where he doesn't show Harry concern.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, Master Pakku is a sexist prick who initially refuses to teach Katara water bending and only warms up when it turns out Katara is his ex-fiancée's granddaughter. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em>, Master Pakku immediately accepts both Aang and Katara as his students without any hesitation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the films, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">believing that if he doesn't do something, the universe will suffer from overpopulation, environmental damage, and wars for resources, and leaving half of Gamora's species alive.</span> In the comics, he worshiped Death the entity, was a nihilist, killed half the universe to as an offering to Death and actually enjoyed reliving his crimes when subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a>'s Penance Stare. Though in the films and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gamora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gamora">Gamora</a>s people were decimated by Thanos who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">abducts her from her mother</a>, whilst in the comics Thanos rescues Gamora from the genocide of her people at hands of zealots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">and adopts her</a>.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr">Robert Downey Jr.</a>'s take on Tony Stark / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> like in the comics, there's much more emphasis on the "heart of gold" than the "jerk" part (in particular, he's surprisingly good with kids). For one thing, while comics Tony still initially remained an arms dealer even after becoming Iron Man, this version began shutting down that part of the business the moment he got back to America. This difference particularly comes through in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>; in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> comic, Tony willingly adopts ever more extreme (to the point of downright villainous) methods in order to enforce the Superhero Registration Act, while in the film, he's visibly bothered by the more extreme means used by the government to enforce the Sokovia Accords.
</li><li> Similar to Tony, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a> is much nicer in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em> movie than in the comics, where he's a deranged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a> whose hurt everyone close to him. In the movie while grouchy Hank is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a> who loves his wife Janet and daughter Hope and will do anything for them. In comics Hank has infamously troubled relationship with Janet which led to a divorce and never even met his daughter Nadia.
<ul><li> Hope is also much nicer than comic version, where shes the psychotic Red Queen who tried to kill the Avengers.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki">Loki</a> in the comics was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> and did his best to bring about Ragnarok and also cause mayhem on Earth as well. In the films while hes still villainous for most part, Loki genuinely loves his brother Thor, his mother Frigga and father Odin. In comics he had no qualms trying to kill his Asgard family multiple times.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther</a></em>, T'Challa is a charming, friendly, and charismatic politician who gets along with most people he meets. This is in stark contrast with the comic book version, who is often smug, secretive, and standoffish towards non-Wakandans (especially Westerners).
</li><li> Adrian Toomes aka The Vulture is a despicable old man in the comics who is always out for himself. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em> though hes still a criminal Toomes only wants to support his family and actually has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect">Villain Respect</a> for Spider-Man to extent where he doesnt give Spideys identity away to the Scorpion when questioned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yon-Rogg is a sincere Kree nationalist who wants to protect his people and serve their interests, however ruthless and deceptive that requires him to be.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matilda">Matilda</a></em> - Book Hortensia is a mean student who bullies Matilda and Lavender. Movie Hortensia is friendly and warns them not to anger the Trunchbull.

In the comics, they were former war criminals who became human traffickers. There's additionally the fact Tiberiu goes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after revenge on Jigsaw after he sets Cristu up to be arrested, whereas in the comics, Tiberiu and Cristu piss each other off to the point, they once tried to kill each other.</span>
</li><li> Pittsy and Ink are now father and son rather being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">those two henchmen</a> and serve as Jigsaw's more sane teammates.

In the comics he was involved in a gang war where he kidnapped an elderly former "cleaner" for the Irish Mob and made him slowly slice up a living rival.

He still has a chip on his shoulder and is quite sarcastic, but it's greatly toned down this time.
</li><li> Likewise, Freddy isn't a lying con artist like he was in the <em>New 52</em> comics.

Also, Book!Tywin is an all-out misogynist who locks Cersei out of the Small Council because she's a woman. In the show he's still dismissive of her, but when she accuses him of sexism, he says he distrusts her not because she's a woman, but because she's a fool.
</li><li> Arya Stark has warmer relationships with Gendry, Hot Pie and even Sandor Clegane than she does in the books.
</li><li> Loras Tyrell is much more mild-mannered and level-headed than the arrogant hothead of the books, as shown by his sympathy for Sansa and his intention to be a decent husband instead of simply treating her with empty chivalry as in the novels.
</li><li> His sister, Margaery Tyrell, became nicer and friendlier to Sansa in the show where after her planned engagement to Loras was foiled by Tywin, who decided to have her wed to Tyrion. Margaery comforted her and reassures her that marrying Tyrion might not be bad. However, her book counterpart shuns Sansa after the plot to marry her to one of her brothers fell through out of political necessity (though still feeling bad for her), with only her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> middle brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Garlan the Gallant</a>, continuing to interact with her in a meaningful way.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen never holds any grudges against the Starks in the show unlike in the books where she considers Ned Stark's as "the Usurper's dog".

During his guest spot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManAndHisAmazingFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManAndHisAmazingFriends">Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</a></em>, he was instead depicted in a much kinder and friendlier light, and even got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Teased</a> with Firestar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperheroSquadShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperheroSquadShow">The Superhero Squad Show</a></em> portrays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> as friendlier and more laid back than other incarnations, a strong contrast from the mindlessly destructive and perpetually angry brute he's usually portrayed as.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> Terra in the comics was a pretty mean character even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">revealing her association with Deathstroke</a>. She calls everyone names and is always fighting with Beast Boy. He sees it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">Slap-Slap-Kiss</a>, but she just doesn't like him period. In the cartoon, she is toned down into a genuinely friendly but troubled girl who gets mixed up with Slade.
</li><li> Starfire is still a nice person in the comics, but the cartoon softened her up even more. She's less abrasive and hot-blooded in the cartoon, showing more dorky behavior .
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>, this happens with this incarnation of the Shredder, where his love for his daughter, Karai, is very genuine. The problem is that he has rooted himself so deep in his hatred toward the Hamato Clan, even his love for his daughter doesn't seem to matter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">culminating in her mutation, which he still blames on the Hamato Clan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">despite him being the one using her as bait for the trap that did it</a></span>.
</li><li> This was put on display in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventureBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventureBegins">The Adventure Begins</a></em> which was a readaptation of some of the earliest stories of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRailwaySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRailwaySeries">The Railway Series</a></em> books and TV series:
<ul><li> Thomas is far more idealistic and innocent than he was in his debut novel in where he would play tricks on the other engines and is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a>.
</li><li> Henry is far more meek and gentle, and his hatred of the rain is treated more as a phobia (in the books he was merely pompous about getting his paint spoiled, if you don't go by the theory that Henry was actually having mechanical issues that day and had stopped in the tunnel to cover them up).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaRama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaRama">Total DramaRama</a></em> does this to a few characters. Duncan is still a bully and a troublemaker, but he is far less cruel towards the other kids and merely just a naughty mischief-maker; Courtney is still very bossy and a huge perfectionist, but she is <em>far</em> less of a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> and lacks her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> and cutthroat competitive streak; and Chef Hatchet goes from cruel and sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan">Angry Black Man</a> to a strict but fair and well-meaning preschool teacher.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRescueBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRescueBots">Transformers: Rescue Bots</a></em> portrays Blades as a friendly but somewhat timid rescue worker, while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">G1</a> counterpart is generally portrayed as rather bloodthirsty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, Proteus is very childlike and naive, and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">confused and misguided</a> than outright evil. This is in <em>stark</em> contrast to the comics, where Proteus is a violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopath</a> who has no problem with killing multiple innocent people for his own gain. As an illustration of how different they are, TV!Proteus' goal was to reconnect with his estranged father, while Comic!Proteus' just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide">killed</a></em> him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> Compared to his  shall we say, controversial comic-book counterpart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Scott</a> is kind to his friends, likable, and much more unambiguously heroic in this series.
</li><li> This also applies to Scott's younger brother, Alex. In the comics, Alex is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> and rebellious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who frequently clashes with Scott. In the show, Alex is a friendly and easy-going person and he and Scott get along great.
</li><li> Due to the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">changes to certain characters' ages</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> never falls in love with teenage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>, and therefore never has the heated rivalry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> that is the cause for much of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> behavior in the comics (though the two did briefly have a leadership struggle). Also, while he always was fond of young mutant daughter figures, it would take decades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for him to be anywhere close to willing to play father figure with Storm and Xavier for an entire group of mutant children before any school for gifted youngsters or superhero team was properly established.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a> is more reasonable and plays well with others, as opposed to being completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.
</li><li> Avalanche is a much more sympathetic character, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">He acts as Kitty Pryde's major love interest</a> and even has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">brief stint as a member of the X-Men</a> before returning to the Brotherhood of Mutants.
</li><li> Apocalypse is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> trying to help mutants.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Batman is depicted as more fatherly and expressive than other versions. At least until <em>Outsiders</em> where he does sink to some of the manipulative lows his comics counterpart did.
</li><li> The Light, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">a.k.a. the Secret Society of Super Villains</a>, are still villains, but they're out to make Earth a universal superpower. Additionally, Vandal Savage and Black Manta aren't as monstrous as their comic counterparts. Lex Luthor started out this way, but much like Batman in <em>Outsiders</em>, the same season saw Luthor descend to the petty vindictiveness his comics counterpart's known for.
