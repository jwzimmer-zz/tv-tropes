They wail and flutter around the edges of reality without substance or even thought. All they have is need. ... We go out of fashion, Sparhawk  like last year's gowns or old shoes and hats. The Powerless Ones are discarded Gods who shrink and shrink as the years go by until they're finally nothing at all but a kind of anguished wailing."</em>

</p><p>The deity could have been originally conceived and shaped by the needs and desires of one small group but like any good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme">meme</a>, this 'idea' grows with each new person who responds, then spreads the word of this great new 'god on the block'. Soon, the deity has enough collective belief behind their 'name brand' that they come into existence, and use that power to fulfill the needs of their worshippers. In this sense, a god is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa">Tulpa</a>, a thought form, made completely out of their worshipper's belief and faith in them.
</p><p>The opposite is also true: As a deity's power base of worshippers shrinks, their divine strength fades and if all worship of them ceases, they may completely fade out of existence. The tragedy here is that worshippers who leave the god because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousRussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousRussianRoulette">he/she didn't grant their miracle</a> will continuously weaken the god until they can't grant <em>any</em> miracles. It's kind of like a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run">bank run<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on a god.

Big concepts like Fate or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a> are pretty safe, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco">Disco</a> is in critical condition.

In games where you play as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, this is often used as a game mechanic to explain why you can't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> your way through <em>everything</em>. It can also be used by authors as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against organized religion.

</p><p>This weakness is often used by misotheistic (god-hating) characters to deliberately harm or kill a god. It is often one of few ways.

The gods of most typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> games grant divine spells to their priests, which give them all kinds of fancy powers. Mortals and gods then end up in a symbiotic relationship, with the humans providing belief and worship to the gods and the gods providing assorted divine miracles in return.
</p><p>This trope is related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Emotion Eater</a>, but doesn't imply evil, vampirism, or negative emotions unless the god is tied in with those by nature. In belief systems of this kind, the empowered god often gives power back to his worshipers. Gods in such a system should be very worried indeed if they find out that they're down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyBeliever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyBeliever">The Only Believer</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernizedGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernizedGod">Some gods may choose to update themselves to stay relevant.</a> If the story is about the process of one set of gods dying out this way to make room for another, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheOldGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheOldGods">Death of the Old Gods</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe">Stop Worshipping Me</a>, for when the god hates the worship they get. Unless the god wants to die and can't because of all the worship...
</p><p>This trope is dependent on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalReligion">Physical Religion</a> to entice prayer in the first place.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, the entirety of Astral Plane of existence, is actually the embodiment of the collective human subconscious. As such, beings that exist in human fantasy such as mythological creatures exist within the Astral realm. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even the Idea of Evil, the equivalent of God in this setting, is created from humanity's desire for a reason in their suffering.</span>
</li><li> Very important in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kannagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kannagi">Kannagi</a></em>. As traditional faith dwindled the sisters have been losing their powers to the point where they are fighting over the remaining faith power. Nagi's sacred tree which once sustained her has been cut down, and Zange's is inside a church, further dwindling / altering their powers and conditions. Zange has been taking on Christian aspects and resorting to setting herself up as a pop star to gain "faith" in the form of fans. The more believers they get, the more powerful they become.
</li><li> In the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PitaTen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PitaTen">Pita-Ten</a></em> it is revealed that angels' and demons' existence depends on human faith in them, and once some entity is forgotten it ceases to exist which is a way to kill demon or angel, however if memory is restored it is possible to revive a dead demon or angel. Strangely enough these virtual creatures have quite strong real powers and can manipulate human memory as well.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> world, the dragon gods gain strength from praise and worship, which is in contrast to the opposing Mazoku who feed on human suffering. This plays a role in a war between one of the gods and the Mazoku race that occurs a thousand years in the past from Lina's time. The Mazoku crippled the Water Dragon King by killing all the worshipers and destroying all the temples dedicated to the latter.
</li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends">Natsume's Book of Friends</a></em> has a very poignant example of this trope (that also doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>) when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a> that took up residence in a roadside shrine begins to lose his power (and his tether to the living world) as the people who once prayed to him all begin to die of old age. Natsume himself offers to pray to him but the Youkai refuses saying: "It's impossible, because you are my friend."
</li><li> A key theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Masami Eiri</span> defines godhood as this, and the main thrust of his scheme is ensuring he will have people believe him to be God, so that for all intents and purposes he will be.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> has it that the Nations are born when their national identity begins to develop, and "die" when no one identifies with them anymore.
<ul><li> This theory rather strongly brings into question Canada's existence but would explain why he is much weaker than his twin.
<ul><li> Actually, the theory would explain it perfectly, considering that Hetalia takes place around WWII. Canadian historians generally agree that their national identity truly began in WWI, and at some point after Canada gained full independence from the UK.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NuraRiseOfTheYokaiClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NuraRiseOfTheYokaiClan">Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan</a></em> when Senba, a god of healing, feared he would fade away and disappear because no one visited his shrine anymore.
</li><li> One chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em> shows the point when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FlyingSpaghettiMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FlyingSpaghettiMonster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> finally gets enough worshipers to become real because of this trope. FF being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">the kind of manga it is</a>, it manifests by absorbing several of its followers into a single hideous mass.
</li><li> A major point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NaquaDen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NaquaDen">Naqua-Den</a></em> as the Gods need prayers for power in order to fend off threats from malicious or corrupt Gods. But since most people in the modern era don't believe or worship them like they used to anymore, Nakua has to find ways to get them to do so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Noragami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Noragami">Noragami</a></em>, the more worshipers a god has, the greater their power. Main character Yato is hoping to become the most revered deity in the world, even though he's just a shrineless vagrant who waits on cell phone calls for jobs. He's reduced to granting wishes for ¥5, whether they be finding a lost cat, cleaning a bathroom or breaking a curse. However, unlike normal fiction with this trait, a god with no followers whatsoever won't vanish, they'll merely continue their immortal lives with only a fraction of the power they could have.
<ul><li> Revealed later to actually be a straight example of the trope. Gods disappear if they have no followers to pray to them, and if a god is slain, while a more popular god will reincarnate (albeit without their former incarnation's memories), an obscure god with few believers is out of luck. The fact that Yato has been able to endure for centuries is considered by others to be something of a miracle.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AmagiBrilliantPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AmagiBrilliantPark">Amagi Brilliant Park</a></em>, the beings from Maple Land need people to like and believe in them or else they will cease to exist. After settling down on Earth, they opened up a theme park with them as the star attractions. The story starts with the park declining in popularity and threatened with foreclosure, so they bring in intelligent human Seiya Kanie to bring the park back in shape and save them. They comment that some of them could probably survive by turning into begging street performers, but that isn't really an option for the less talented and less attractive among them.
</li><li> In The Gamer ch97 it is revealed that gods are born from people's shared belief
</li><li> Gods don't <em>need</em> followers to survive in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">High School D×D</a></em>, but it certainly helps. The old pantheons consist of very powerful individuals, but without faithful to carry out their will on a strategic scale, there's not much they can do. Especially since most of the world is some variant of Abrahamic, and all Abrahamic religions actually refer to the same (physically extant) heaven and holy figures, meaning the Angel faction is a <em>juggernaut</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">God being dead</a> and the angels' powers being reliant on a rickety system that requires blind faith that would be compromised by active leadership, along with a manpower shortage after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a></span> are needed to balance what would otherwise be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">story-breaking advantage</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss">Kamisama Kiss</a></em>, this is played largely straight. Early on, Tomoe explains to Nanami that fulfilling godly duties increases her overall magical abilities (called "Divine Power") and the fastest way is by answering the prayers who've come to the shrine. Later on in a flashback, Lady Yonomori explains that she came to exist when people living near the river grew fearful of the river flooding and being violent, so they created a shrine, and she came into being. However, eventually the people forgot the shrine and built a dam instead, which drowned the shrine and Yonomori faded from existence - much to the sorrow of Mizuki.

More traditional gods like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ares">Ares</a> have not been worshiped on a wide scale for centuries. They don't complain about loss of power or seek out new worshipers. They show no loss of power over time. Some writers have shown a connection between mortals and gods, but generally this is more a cultural connection that allows gods to interact on Earth instead of a dependency on faith.
<ul><li> Some entities, usually malevolent entities, that are worshiped as gods in Marvel really do derive power from it- Dormammu, for instance, has his energies constantly replenished by worship throughout the multiverse, while the Elder God Set once gained power not from worship <em>per se</em>, but by violence committed by certain species he was connected to (such as the dinosaurs). However, in both cases their power is more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a>- using their powers costs them magical energy, and they only need rest to replenish it (though Dormammu also gains strength from annexing other dimensions). On their own both are as strong or stronger than even the likes of Odin, who is the strongest "regular" god there is and can affect things on a <em>galactic</em> scale- worship simply means they don't have to worry about tiring themselves out.
</li></ul></li><li> DC gods tend to be more vulnerable to this, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Olympians</a> can also draw strength from the veneration of their attributes, like war (Ares), skill &amp; wisdom (Athena) and love (Aphrodite) which lead to those three becoming the most powerful Olympians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em>. This also effects the way they're able to adapt with the times as Zeus and Hera are sky gods without worship or venerated attributes to draw on their personalities and values are static and ancient. These days power relies less on direct worship and more on how important the concept a god represents is to the mortal world, for instance Ares can feed on conflict of any kind. When the Olympians were widely worshiped they had to split off avatars of themselves—the Roman pantheon—or be overwhelmed with power, a problem even the strongest of their number has no issue with in modern times indicating worship is their best source of strength.
<ul><li> At one point, Wonder Woman caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AresDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AresDC">Ares</a> to realize that as much as he wants to trigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> and wipe out humanity with nukes, he can't. While such a war would give him a short term power boost, if everyone is dead, there will be no more war and he would eventually fade into nothing. Ares eventually found a way around this by overthrowing Hades and becoming the God of the Dead too. As the dead in the Underworld are all his worshipers, he was safe to try to trigger World War III again.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewGods">New Gods</a> tend to stay strong without a race to draw strength from, but at times they have implied to be more the gods of Ideas- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, for instance, is the God of Tyranny. Incidentally, he is the only god worshipped on Apokolips and he is <em>far</em> more powerful than all of his minions, each gods in their own right. However, this has nothing to do with how many worshipers he has- he has instead been periodically slaughtering entire <em>pantheons</em> of gods of other worlds and stealing their power for himself, and he was amongst the strongest New Gods before doing that anyway. The New Gods do not seem to ever depend on worship for their power.
</li><li> In fact, New God Orion was <em>very emphatic</em> about this in his series - when rather pathetically confronted by a defeated enemy with this notion, he replied "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality">You have been reading too much fiction</a>. Gods are not dependent on their worshipers - worshipers are dependent on their gods."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FearItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FearItself">Fear Itself</a></em> crossover, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> mocks, invokes, <em>and</em> turns this into one helluva <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>. He started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">screaming at Odin and the other gods</a> (but mostly Odin), yelling that if they wanted a sacrifice he'd give them the "only thing he could give worth anything": his sobriety, by taking a huge swig of alcohol. Even though it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> scene, it was effective to the fans who know how hard he works to stay sober.
</li><li> DC has this apply to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FreedomFighters">Uncle Sam</a>, whose power is directly proportional to the American People's belief in freedom and liberty. Whether American protectorates like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands' people's belief in freedom and liberty counts towards this is never specified.
</li><li> Thor once discussed this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>. Even he's not certain whether his existence depends on mortal belief, and wonders if he will just vanish when people no longer need him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki">Loki</a> on the other hand quite confident on claiming that gods <em>don't</em> need belief... but they do need something from people and that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality">stories</a>. On one hand believing Loki is not a smart idea on the other they <em>did</em> demonstrate the ability to affect change by mucking with myths. (To date Loki successfully rewrote Cul, wrote Hela into existence, and retold Loki.)
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe, a reimagination of the Marvel Universe, Thor fought against Thanos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFantasticFour">Ultimate Fantastic Four</a></em>. The latter notes that as powerful as Thor is, he's nowhere near as powerful as he was when his pantheon was actively worshipped.
</li><li> Prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> reboot, DC villain Eclipso tried to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> by destroying the focal point of the worship that sustains Him: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Earth</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> had gods born from dreams and when they were forgotten they would return to the world of dreams to eventually fade away. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em> followed a similar idea. The goddess Bast is a shadow of her former self. Ishtar had to become a stripper. Pharamond changed his role and became a minor god of transportation. The Japanese gods absorb articles of faith from other pantheons and modern times to survive. The Norse gods appear to be doing pretty well though.
<ul><li> In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> frequently reminded readers that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">The Endless</a> are not gods, because they do not care if they are remembered and will persist long after humanity is gone. They <em>really are</em> Death, Dream, Despair etc, and their existence depends on these aspects of the universe rather than mythology, and not just on Earth. That said they can be <em>altered</em> by human perception or simple changes in the cosmos, but these changes typically happen over the course of eons.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>, after Bob's character, Knuckles III, dies, his next character (Knuckles IV) manages to get Knuckles III promoted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantasySpelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantasySpelling">gawdhood</a>. Temples to Knu-Kyle-Ra are now a recurring feature in the comic. Unfortunately, they don't owe Bob's other characters any favors.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFaithInFrankie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFaithInFrankie">My Faith In Frankie</a></em>, gods gain power from the belief of their followers. Judging by Jeriven, they only need one true believer to be at full strength, but more may have more effect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one of the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ConanTheBarbarian">Savage Sword of Conan</a> comics, Conan's physical likeness to a hero-turned-demigod is exploited by a local tyrant looking to put down a growing rebellion and win droves of recruits to his army. (Said hero, Shan, had once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">promised to return to his people one day when their suffering became intolerable</a>.) This becomes problematic when the actual demigod shows up on the battlefield and strikes down everyone who participated in the fraud, except Conan. Impressed by his bravado, Shan decides to slay Conan in hand-to-hand combat. Clearly outmatched, Conan undermines Shan by questioning his motives, pointing out that if he really cared about the welfare of his worshipers, he would have freed them from the tyrant long ago; he only appeared on the battlefield because he was in serious danger of losing their adulation. Conan's words make Shan's followers question their belief, which actually de-powers the deity. Conan finally disarms him and runs him through, forcing Shan to retreat to the realm of the gods, now deprived of the worship needed to sustain him.
</li><li> Averted by Crom. He's liable to kill anyone who dares pray to him, as it implies his gift of life and the will to do battle was not enough. Though in the movies, he does answer Conan's first and only prayer to him due to the extraordinary circumstances.
</li></ul></li><li> The universe of Asceltis (in French comic books <em>Les brumes d'Asceltis</em> and <em>Les exilés d'Asceltis</em>) embodies this trope. It is quite scary to see what Gods can do to keep people believing in them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionLord">Dimension Lord</a> Mojo's magic powers are tied to the number of people who pay him homage, which they do by watching his TV shows.
</li><li> The Greek gods in <em>The Red Seas</em> are like this; on the Isle of Bronze, there are a group of massive statues originally built by Hephaestus in order to absorb faith and thus recharge the gods. For some reason, the Norse gods don't need faith in the same way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> also seems fine, but that's likely to be because most people do believe in him.
</li><li> While it's likely not an issue for the true God, this is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">The Demon</a> came to reach his current level of power in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrimmFairyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrimmFairyTales">Grimm Fairy Tales</a></em>. In the beginning he was one of the weakest of all demons, but he was the first to realize that human prayers contained power, and it quickly took him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>.
</li><li> <em>Harry Kipling (Deceased)</em> works this way, with some creative upshots from Simon Spurrier. For example, since Klux was made from Kipling's tissue, Klux considers Kipling to be his creator and thus a god. Gaining a single worshipper means that Kipling is technically a god, and thus is able to kill other gods. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">New Atheist Militia</a> realise they can destroy gods by massacring their followers, and their denial ultimately manifests as an anti-god which operates much like any other deity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lanfeust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lanfeust">Lanfeust</a></em>, the Darshanide Gods need believers to exist. The first time the heroes visit the divine court, they witness the goddess <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Renaud">Lynrenö<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> fading into nothingness as her last believer dies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson">Crimson</a></em>, humans are most favored by the Creator because his existence is sustained by their collective belief and worship, in contrast to supernatural monsters such as vampires, werewolves, dragons and etc. One of the reasons why the Devil managed to turn to his side a very powerful race that predated mankind known as the Grigori, was because they were shunned by God due to their inability to "sustain" him. This turns into a plot-point when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plan to destroy reality starts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">wiping out humanity</a>, which would weaken God enough for her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheGod">destroy him herself</a></span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GodzillaRageAcrossTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GodzillaRageAcrossTime">Godzilla: Rage Across Time</a></em>, Aphrodite vainly tries to warn Zeus and the other gods of this trope, as she feels that they've become too uncaring for the fates of mortals. Her warnings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">turn out to be true</a> when Godzilla appears and attacks Mt Olympus: Zeus finds that the lack of faith has weakened him and the gods are slain by the King of Monsters.
</li><li> This is the case in the setting for <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermanHedning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermanHedning">Herman Hedning</a></em>, which includes 12 or so creator gods (including the Christian God who created our particular corner of the universe), and countless other minor divine beings. As explained by God himself, gods and certain other entities such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> require active belief in them to continue existing. This also applies retroactively, as gods do not exist until someone comes up with them, and enough people belive in them. Once they do, the god will suddenly always have existed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Of course, this also means that both the god and his creations created EACHOTHER</a> as one cannot exist without the other.

This does, however, lead to a very interesting take with the Greco-Roman pantheon, with several of them opting to use either their Greek or Roman names depending on which is more well-known (i.e., Zeus continues using his original name rather than the less well known Jupiter, but Venus and Vulcan have all but abandoned the names Aphrodite and Hephaestus).

Brown's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AstralDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AstralDawn">Astral Dawn</a></em> series plays with this trope through the high spirits. Many high spirits became gods during a period called the God Age. The psychic energy they received from their followers made them even stronger than they had become. All high spirit gods, be they light or dark, are beyond normal space-time, allowing them to feed off of their worshippers from a specific time period. This means they never need to worry about their worshippers decreasing or dying off.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AEVanVogt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AEVanVogt">A. E. van Vogt</a> story <em>The Book of Ptath</em>, gods are powered by "prayer sticks", which are actual machines (albeit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">Sufficiently Advanced ones</a>) that are physically manipulated by their worshipers to send power to the god.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords">Book of Swords</a></em>, when people find out gods can be killed, their faith is shaken. Eventually, it is discovered that humans created gods by believing... which they stop, destroying all the gods. This leads to the question of "If humans made the gods, where did humans come from?" (Inversion of a question often asked of theists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.)
</li><li> This becomes a significant plot-point in the last two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrimstoneAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrimstoneAngels">Brimstone Angels</a></em> novels. The god Enlil is all but dead, and needs mortal worshippers to power himself back up to the point of being able to have much effect on the world. Unfortunately for him, the only mortals he's been able to make contact with are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicHumanoid">dragonborn</a>, who are a proud race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay Theists</a> who neither need nor want a god to worship. The eventual agreement that's reached is more like a business contract than a religion, with the dragonborn agreeing to pray to Enlil so long as he uses his restored powers to protect their city, and even give him an affectionate but silly nickname (Uncle Lightning-Bolt) as a reminder that he's their <em>ally</em>, not their master.

The Olympians have not been widely worshipped in centuries and have not suffered any major loss in power. The Titans were sealed in Tartarus for thousands of years and survived. The almost unheard of snow goddess Khione is doing fine. However, there is some link. It's been stated that if Western Civilization were to fall, it would weaken the Olympians. Being forgotten can cause a god to lose their will to live, leaving them to fade from existence, though like Khione or the Titans it is largely a matter of personal will. The god Pan tried to fade two millennia ago, but the beliefs of nymphs and satyrs caused him to continue to live.
</li><li> As early as the first book there are hints about this. Medusa mentions sadly that her two sisters are no longer around. Im <em>Battle of the Labyrinth</em> Briares says his brothers have also faded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> has a <em>retirement home</em> for mostly forgotten gods, who have become senile.
</li><li> Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTrialsOfApollo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTrialsOfApollo">The Trials of Apollo</a></em>, where Apollo is rendered mortal, there is a bit more information provided on the subject. All of the pantheons in this universe (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">Egyptian</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard">Norse</a>, etc.) are tied to the cultural impact they have had on society, and draw power from the memories and beliefs people have about them. This explains why the loss of Apollo as the god of the sun can still leave the world in functioning condition, without people wondering where the hell the sun went, because the sun gods of other mythologies (and the scientific explanation for why the sun rises and sets) can pick up the slack. Should the culture they are tied to disappear, or should no one remember them, then they would ultimately fade away. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This trope is also exploited by the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">big bads</a> of the series called the Triumvirate, a trio of Roman emperors who made such a historical impact that they have been able to live for thousands of years off of people's worship and memory of them.</span>

In this setting, it's especially clear that only <em>worship</em> will sustain a god: merely being acknowledged to exist doesn't suffice to keep them around. Thus, a pantheon of Chumash native deities can be dying out from lack of sincere prayers directed towards them, even though plenty of <em>non</em>-worshipers in the EPA are aware of their existence and concerned for their welfare as "endangered gods". Maintaining artificial cults is as much a practical matter as it is idealistic; all of the magic is divine. One of the gods maintained by an artificial cult, for example, is Hermes, and spells calling on him are the basis for most of their telecommunications.

In fact, the three gods of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Northern</span> Scadrial ended up with inversely related to the amount of followers (all three religions are henotheistic, worshiping one god in a pantheon).

</li><li> In Jennifer Fallon's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DemonChildTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DemonChildTrilogy">Demon Child Trilogy</a></em>, the Primal Gods are the ones that will exist as long as life exists (Love, War, the Oceans), and don't rely on human belief for power. They do gain strength through worship, but this doesn't entail praying, but by doing things related to their aspect (for example, "honouring Dacendaren" is a euphemism for stealing; Damin Wolfblade is favoured by Zegarnald, God of War, because he wins a lot of wars), whether the individuals doing so are intentionally honoring the relevant gods or are even sapient (a racoon stealing eggs from a bird's nest is just as much a form of worship for Dacendaren as a pickpocket making off with someone's purse; a war between two ant colonies honors Zegarnald in the same way that a war between two nations does). On the other hand, the Incidental Gods are demons that gather enough worshippers to become gods. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series is an Incidental God that has gathered enough followers to challenge the Primal Gods' power.

He left at the height of his power, promising to return during the rise of the next prophet. When he does come back from his godly vacation, he finds himself inexplicably trapped in the body of a small tortoise, unable to conjure more than a spark of static. As it turns out, his followers began to believe less in him and more in his church, or more specifically that showing proper commitment to the church <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">was less likely to have you tortured to death for heresy</a>. By Om's return, only a single lowly acolyte believes in the actual deity Om rather than Omnianism. There's also one man who disbelieves in him so intensely and specifically (and to his face) that it's almost as good; Om is suitably impressed at this and takes something of a liking to him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsAGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsAGod">an impossible-to-deny public miracle</a> to bring him to proper, Divine strength</span>.

By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em>, the Abominations have helped cripple a war-torn Borogravia's economy (no more crop rotation) and have become so deranged (Abominating babies and the color blue) that citizens have taken to praying to the land's Duchess for succor. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, Nuggan is revealed to have faded away, with the Abominations as a sort of echo, while Borogravia's faith in its Duchess has given the now dead woman a quasi-deity status, much to her consternation.

The One who will desert you when you need Her the most - and sometimes She might not..." is generally thought of as the most powerful goddess in the whole Discworld Pantheon. She has few if any true worshipers (being treated all Goddess-like upsets her and is likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx">counterproductive</a>), but -everyone- directs a prayer her way when they are in a really tight spot.

<ul><li> Spiritual entities need some level of recognition to operate on Earth. Thus the various old gods (with a little 'g') have very little ability to act on their power. This is laid out in info concerning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Venatori, who fight the Oblivion War, trying to get all memory of magical entities removed from the human psyche, and therefore cut their connection to the material world. Need-to-know basis doesn't even begin to describe it. But now <em>you</em> know, so now they have to kill you.</span>.
</li><li> Also evidence suggests that this doesn't apply to God (with a big 'G') and His assorted Archangels. Not that it would really matter if He did need prayer, given how many believers He has.
</li><li> The other gods we've met so far (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Odin</a> and Hades) seem to have plenty of power, despite not having that many followers, though Hades makes it clear that he is "weaker". But "weaker" is relative to a major god. Neither comes close to the Abrahamic God in power (at least, as far as we've seen) but both can still throw some weight around. (That said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassSanta">Santa Claus</a> is an aspect of Odin, and Santa Claus, even if he doesn't have many real believers, is a pretty big influence nowadays...</span> and Hades is rather famous... as a backstabbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> that doesn't even vaguely resemble his actual personality, but hey, fame is fame.)
</li><li> It should be noted that they do not cease to exist with lack of worship. They can still be active in the spiritual realms and other dimensions. Some books have implied that how humans perceive the universe is very limited compared to gods and other supernatural creatures. To humans, the god might be inactive, but they are still active in other ways. Many of these entities predated humanity and it is unknown how they came into contact with Earth or if the ever changing rules of magic had anything to do with it.
</li><li> It is possible (if more of a stretch) that it's not based on <em>worship</em>, but on <em>awareness</em>. Lots of people know who Odin is, but not many worship him. This theory gets traction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame">Skin Game</a></em> when Hades, who is still as powerful as ever, says he never asked for prayers and sacrifices, and was honestly a bit confused at the point of worshiping him. After all, what would come of it? Did they think he would be merciful? Answer: no. Hades is not merciful. Hades gives you exactly what you deserve, good or bad, completely fairly. Which is why we can all take heart that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deirdre's fate will be just as horrible as she deserves.</span>
</li><li> Even the type of worship a god receives can change. Butcher notes in their heyday, the old gods would need to listen to prayers, make social calls, and do more active things. If, as the modern world doesn't worship like that, a god could still get a cult of followers believing in the principals the god holds to and using the newest name the god has picked up, that would suffice. So a god could use a comic book character or persona to gain followers, take that belief to sustain himself, but not have all the old obligations he once had.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jkdt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0jkdt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jkdt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Heracles is mentioned to be using the Incredible Hulk in such a method</span>
</li><li> The Oblivion War acknowledges this trope and uses it against some very old and very evil gods. These ancient and evil forces don't need prayer to reenter the human world, just simple knowledge of them will suffice. So those who fight on humanity's side seek to make sure the total sum of any who remember a god is zero. If word of a god's followers is discovered, orders to take them out are sent to a small group of people, to minimize the numbers of people who might learn that god's name. The current number of fighters is close to 200 for the entire world. Now, some beings, like spirits of intellect, can have knowledge of the name but that won't sustain the god. They need mortals to know their name. Once a god's rememberers are all eliminated and all is quiet for a few hundred years, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Archive, the repository of all human knowledge, written or typed, deletes the name of the god from her own memory</span> and the god is now sealed away to Oblivion. As those on humanity's side forget and never record how many they killed, it has lead to an interesting point they don't know how well they have done. Simply recording the kill could be enough of a tether for the god to work its way back.

Less-popular religions are located at the end of the street closest to the city gate; the more numerous a deity's followers, the farther from the gate his temple is located. Religions ebb and fall up and down the street throughout Lankhmar's history.
</li><li> Raymond E. Feist's Midkemian books have this. There are a number of classifications of gods. There are beings that are "more powerful than gods, yet less," and they are the forces of nature. They do not have a consciousness, but they can be influenced but cannot be controlled. There are the controller gods which are the primal stuff of the world. They couldn't care less about the people or what they are doing. Prayers to them are irrelevant. Next, there are the lesser gods. These are the ones that people pray to. They are also forces of nature but are identified and idealized by the people and interact with them. The lesser gods are the ones that fit this trope. And if enough worshipers go away, they would lose their power and potentially die. However, they may also return if at some time in the future enough worshipers begin to exist again. This is because they are still at their heart the personification of some aspect in nature or concept such as justice, the sea, or war. The god of magic, Sarig is one such dead god. When a god "dies" the natural force doesn't die with it, but rather that aspect is taken up by another god, at least until such time as the old god returns. An example of this is the God Killian who is the goddess of nature, but also reigns over the oceans and seas, having taken over for her dead brother Eortis, the God of the Sea.

Here it is stated that while worship - or at least reverence - is needed in order to achieve Godhood, once that state is reached the resultant deity is immortal, and no longer requires active worshippers. Some degree of continuing respect, however, is necessary if a God (or pantheon) is to have any continuing major influence on the mortal world. As an example, it's related by the god Hermes that when Christianity displaced Paganism, a dark age followed because the Olympians held too much of civilization within themselves. It was only when the Christian Trinity allowed Greco-Roman mythology to be rediscovered that the Renaissance became possible.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForLoveOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForLoveOfEvil">For Love of Evil</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a> shows that YHWH used to have a lot of power, but since belief in the Hebrew God had waned, his place had been usurped by the Christian God.

Eventually, however, they amass enough power that they don't need belief to keep going. Still doesn't mean they're indestructible, though.
</li><li> This is the rule that underlies the metaphysics of John Scalzi's novella <em>The God Engines</em>. The more worshipers a god has, and the stronger their faith is, the more powerful the god gets. It also puts a couple of twists on the idea - first, gods get more power from worshipers who converted from another faith than from people who "inherited" the religion, and more still from worshipers who convert from atheism. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The main character's god even keeps planets sequestered from all religion as a sort of "atheist farm", just so they can be converted with a quick miracle to provide a power boost when needed</span>.

</li><li> The Greek gods in Marie Phillips's <em>Gods Behaving Badly</em> have been holed up in a house in North London for a century or two, reduced to shadows of their former selves because the faith that made them powerful is now going to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">the upstart carpenter</a>" and his father.
</li><li> The short story anthology <em>Gods of War</em> (by Christopher Stasheff, et al) features this, but also indicates in addition to the Greek, Norse, and Japanese gods (among others) who fall into this trope, there is the 'one god' who is above the others and has no such concerns or limitations.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles">Iron Druid Chronicles</a></em> the gods have their own sources of magic and don't really need to be constantly worshiped to remain powerful, but active worship is required for them to be able to physically manifest on Earth, and the way people believe in them shapes their appearance when they do. However, they only need to manifest after their original bodies die. Otherwise they're fine.
<ul><li> Jesus does not like to appear to people because he would have to appear nailed to a cross and it's a very painful experience, even for a deity. Mary's appearances are much more frequent and often triggered by the belief of old devout ladies.
</li><li> Complicating matters is the fact that if two groups of believers in the same god diverge enough in their beliefs, the god will split into regional aspects. There are dozens of versions of the Native American god Coyote running around. The Thor from American comics is brought up a few times, but according to Odin 1.0, he exists only as a concept. Without worship he doesn't have enough magic to manifest himself.

Hamilton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MerryGentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MerryGentry">Merry Gentry</a></em> series, the main characters are fairies, and referred to repeatedly as deities or former deities. Those who are still believed in [e.g., Frost] grow in power, and those who are no longer believed in diminish. There are also characters who exist as a sort of vampiric ghost of gods whose worshippers have died out, referred to as the Starving Ones - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they are responsible for several slaughters, increasing in scale, in one of the books, as they use the energy to attempt to rebuild themselves.</span>
<ul><li> The Fey are touchy about this, as most both believe in the existence of higher powers (which have no need for worship) and that they never were gods, seeing the collapse of most of their power (causing them to watch the deaths of the worshippers they could no longer care for) as punishment for the hubris of ever thinking they were. At the same time, they <em>are</em> influenced by human attitudes, and <em>can</em> feed off human notice, admiration and attraction. Also, by now the title character technically has a few human worshippers.

They even have harkers out on the Street of Gods trying to increase their base of worship to gain more power. Who often dissolve into shouting matches over whose dogma's right.

</li><li> Gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenTower">The Raven Tower</a></em> have a finite amount of power to draw from, which gets expended when they alter reality. Being worshipped adds to the pool faster than it accumulates naturally, especially the sacrifice of a willing human, allowing those gods to work greater miracles  but if the god dies, usually by trying to expend more power than they possess, no amount of prayer can bring them back. Notably, the Ancient Ones, gods who predate humanity, arent bound by such limits for reasons unknown even to them.

The actual creators of the earth, however, the Gods, are pretty much oblivious to humanity, and ignore prayers and offerings. The Lords of Darkness are often worshiped as Gods, though (this is a major plot point in the second and fourth books), and are about one level or so below the actual Gods in power. Azhrarn, the first Lord, and personification of Wickedness, is different from the other lords, in that he's older than the universe, doesn't need human belief to be personified, and is probably as old as the Gods, but not as powerful; though it is implied that human perceptions of him do "fluff up" his definition, or at least has some relation to how he manifests, but only slightly. However, it is strongly implied, if not outright stated, that without humanity, Azhrarn would lose his sense of purpose, even though he would still exist. The other lords, like Chuz, Lord of Madness, or Uhlume, Lord of Death, are explicitly the products of human imagination, do not predate the universe, and it is implied that they would fade away without humanity.

<ul><li> A Greek myth/folktale likely written in Christian times by Plutarch tells of the death of the god Pan when people start thinking of him as only a made-up story. One might wonder about the rise of Greek neo-pagans, who have begun worshiping Pan again. Have they resurrected him, or is their belief going unheard?
</li><li> Averted in the Abrahamic religions (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>) as a fundamental part of the theology. For a more direct example <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%2050&amp;version=NLT">Psalm 50<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> states "I do not need the bulls from your barns or the goats from your pens [...] Do I eat the meat of bulls? Do I drink the blood of goats? Make thankfulness your sacrifice to God, and keep the vows you made to the Most High." In short, though God in the Old Testament demands sacrifices, He does not need it to live - prayer and worship are for the benefit of the one doing them, not God.
</li><li> The neo-pagan scholar Isaac Bonewits describes gods as functioning basically as the trope says. He's not alone; this theogony is quite common, especially among Wiccans and Asatru (Norse-pagan revivalists).
</li><li> This trope is fairly common in real-world polytheism, especially those with a substantial animist or pantheist component. Among modern religions, it is especially significant in the religions of the African diaspora in the New World (Vodoun, Santeria, Candomble, Umbanda), and in the Shinto animism of Japan. Historically it was an important though implicit idea in Hellenic- and Roman-era syncretism.
</li><li> There's a "Person Needs Prayer Badly" in Roman Catholicism. In order to go to heaven (or reduce their time in purgatory) and join the angels, the soul of the deceased needed to be prayed for. This led to the modern idea of the funeral  particularly how the modern Western funeral is such a huge deal  as well as other ideas. This is still part of the Catholic beliefs, but you only pray for the soul in Purgatory as man has no role in deciding the salvation of souls.
</li><li> While not all religions believe that their god(s)' power and influence increase in proportion to the number of worshipers, there is no denying that it has this effect on <em>the religion itself</em>. You say the wrong thing to a member of a religious order that has enough clout, you WILL believe in divine retribution. In other words, "religion needs prayer badly".
</li><li> Dystheists (those who believe in God, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">but believe that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a>) often believe that God will die if nobody worships him. Which is what they hope will eventually happen, because they believe humanity cannot truly be free until God dies.
</li><li> The state religion of the Aztec (or Mexica) Empire believed the gods are always hungry  not for belief or prayer, but for human and animal sacrificial victims  and that if they were not fed a steady diet of the hearts of brave warriors, they would surely destroy the world, as they had many times before. The whole Aztec political system was designed to prevent this by waging enough wars that there would always be plenty of POWs to sacrifice; in some cases, Tenochtitlan and another city-state would stage a set-piece "Flower War" with no objective but giving each side a chance to capture some of the others' soldiers for sacrifice. (Not every state the Mexica forced to participate in this seems to have shared their level or form of piety on the matter  a circumstance Cortez, when he arrived, found very useful to his purposes). To put it more bluntly, many of the Aztecs' neighbors, and particularly the less pious ones, saw them as a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> and The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a>, seeing as the Aztecs had a habit of capturing whole villages for sacrifice and then moving into the vacated homes.

To clarify, the gods created the humanity so that they will work and feed the gods, allowing them to live in leisure. Then, the gods couldn't stand the noise people made, so they tried to exterminate them a few times, culminating with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood">The Great Flood</a>.

His wife tells him that she saw a rat at their house, and he doesn't believe her, and assumes she saw a squirrel. He then sees the biggest rat ever crawl across the telephone line in their backyard, get picked up by a hawk, and then get dropped by said hawk in the neighbor's yard, scaring their children, all in 60 seconds. Patton then says that maybe that weird sequence of events was due to a forgotten Sumerian trickster god.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>, a god's power is determined by his/her number of worshippers, and needs at least one worshipper to maintain Divine status (albeit at a demigod level). The only exception is the overdeity Ao, who needs no worshippers to maintain power because he rules over other gods. This development took long to come, as the deities were independently powerful before the Avatar Crisis, when Ao got fed up with nobody doing their duties or taking care of their worshippers any more. The post-Avatar Crisis fluff tended to suggest, when the subject came up, that the Gods <em>did</em> gain power from being prayed to and having followers before the Crisis. What Ao did after the Crisis was, essentially, toning down the power you gained from your Portfolio, and ramping up how much power you gained from belief<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1m4t6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1m4t6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1m4t6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this may explain how Myrkul got the idea for the Spirit-Eater Curse failsafe despite the Avatar Crisis not having occurred yet at that point</span>.

</li><li> Also averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> campaign setting. Several of the greater gods hold their exalted station despite people not being very inclined to worship them.

Nerull <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">"The Reaper"</a> and Incabulos, god of disasters, likewise do not get a lot of attention, if only because most people fear attracting their notice.

Grandfather Thunder then defeats Whipporwill, absorbs his gnosis, and assimilates the Black Spiral Dancers into the now-fallen Shadow Lord tribe.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">Demon: The Fallen</a></em> demons need faith to fuel their powers. They can either force steal it, which causes spiritual damage, or set up cults of various stripes to get a small but steady flow without necessarily hurting their worshippers (unless they <em>want</em> to be hurt).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>:
<ul><li> This setting has the Astral Realms, which include the Temenos, the collective consciousness of humanity. Among the conceptual archetypes present there are every god ever worshipped. In this case, since they are formed through human belief, their power is proportional to how much humans regard them, not necessarily through worship. For example, Anubis exists in the Temenos, and though not as powerful as he was when he was actively worshipped by a powerful nation, he is still a relevant and well known symbol, which means he still possesses the power of a minor god. Other gods are less fortunate. Since the Temenos is a focal point for all human knowledge and experience, even a completely forgotten god would still exist somewhere, albeit significantly weakened. Its also suggested that some Temenos gods might be based by humanity on truly divine beings (a theory particularly popular with devout mages who suffer crises of faith upon learning they can meet their deities in the Temenos).
</li><li> Similarly, various spirits in the Shadow realm are often shaped and empowered by human belief. Whether a particular one appearing as a god was an inspiration for human worship or was formed by human worship is often unclear.
</li></ul></li><li> The Chaos Gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> are both formed and fuelled by the concepts they represent. On the other hand, they don't really need prayer: every feeling of anger, ecstasy, hope, or despair feeds one of the Chaos Gods, whether the person who has the feeling is a follower of Chaos or not (and praying to Khorne instead of killing and bleeding is liable to get your head chopped off). Background material indicates this is the same for all deities, except for the God of Atheism, who gets strong if people don't believe in anything.
<ul><li> It is speculated that the Emperor of Mankind's almost militant atheism and denial of any superstitious talk of "daemons" was a direct attempt to starve the Chaos Gods of belief. While this effort obviously failed, the Imperium's faith in the God-Emperor of Mankind may have helped him become a proper deity himself, enhancing his already-formidable psychic presence and giving humanity a fighting chance, and it must be mentioned that the Horus Heresy is the only documented time when all four chaos gods got off their collective behinds and actually seriously worked to affect the galaxy at large, so the Emperor might have had something right to scare them that way.
</li><li> The Necrons' master plan to end Chaos worked like this pre-6th edition. The Ruinous Powers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbstractApotheosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbstractApotheosis">embodiments of emotions</a> felt by living creatures, so, if you <em>kill off</em> all living beings in the universe (the Necrons are zombie robots), there'll be nothing for Chaos to feed on.
</li><li> Similarly, the von Carsteins of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a> wants to convert the entire world to zombies under their command in order to deny Chaos their bodies and minds. Sadly, the other factions failed to see the logic in this and fight the vampires as much as they do Chaos and each other. This is based off the plan of their forebearer, Nagash the Undying, who considers this Step 1 in his plan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">Kill and Replace</a> the Chaos Gods and be the only will in existance.
</li><li> The Serpent God Sotek is implied to have been created by the belief (and thousands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">skaven sacrifices</a>) of the skinks. The skink-priest Tehenhauin found a golden plaque he believed prophesied the god's coming, and though the Slaan mage-priests initially disdained his claims when Sotek did show up they acknowledged his arrival as part of the Old Ones plans. It's not totally clear if he was correct all along about his interpretation of the plaque, or if the events were his own doing but when faced with a living deity and possible rebellion from the skinks who effectively run Lizardmen society, the Slaan decided to not to argue.

Something many player characters will find handy.
<ul><li> Or the opposite, depending on the campaign: if you start the game marked for death by beings whose job is strongarming gods (which is normal), having a higher profile and more ways to be attacked make it a mixed blessing at best.
</li><li> The game spends quite a bit of time and wordcount <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">examining the ramifications of this trope</a>, too. Gods in Exalted are, by and large, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">jerks</a> who want to get as much power as possible, and in Creation, this usually translates to theological feudalism: the strongest local god receives prayer and sacrifice, and in return doesn't cause the harvest to fail and doesn't let dangerous interloper gods take over the region. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Immaculate Faith</a>, the religion of the Realm, isn't just about getting prayers to the appropriate gods, it's also about preventing gods from getting greedy and extorting extra worship out of the Realm's mortals.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, Gods are naturally more powerful in their own home dimensions, and ones where they have a strong base of the devoted, than in any other dimension.
</li><li> Before coming up with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> and acquiring TSR, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast">Wizards of the Coast</a> released a supplement called <em>The Primal Order</em> to provide formal system-independent rules for deities and ways they interacted with mortals and each other. As described, all gods had a certain amount of power at all times (unless deprived of that by suitable attacks, at which point they could expect to shortly cease to exist barring possession of a loyal home plane to regenerate from over the course of a century), but gathering worshippers both living and dead as well as acquiring planar real estate and spheres of influence all provided significant boosts that only the strangest gods would want to do without.
</li><li> Regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> itself, the God cards of the <em>Theros</em> block qualify.

Even better (or worse,) Melzas <em>knows</em> he gets his powers from prayer, and thus perpetuates a vicious cycle of secretly inflicting horrible nightmares on the people of Inoa to keep them in fear so that they keep praying to him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> Throughout the series and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>, it is repeatedly implied that a deity becomes more powerful as they gain mortal worshipers. According to one theory, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Aedric Divines</a> are technically dead, having sacrificed much of their power during the creation of Mundus, the mortal plane. Now, they "dream they are alive" through mortal prayer and worship. The deities who did not participate in the creation of Mundus, the Daedra, have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> as they did not sacrifice any of their power to create the world, and can exist independent from prayer and worship. (Though they do seem to enjoy receiving it and may still <em>gain</em> power from it.) Other lesser deities can be outright killed by lack of worship. The reason it's easier for greater deities (Aedra and Daedra) is because they personify widely-known abstracts, so even if all their followers in one culture are purged, they have another culture to pick up the slack.
</li><li> As Aldmeri (precursors of the modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">races of Mer</a>) society evolved, commoners stopped worshiping their own ancestors and began worshiping the ancestors of their social "betters", elevating them to the level of gods through collective adulation. The warrior-spirit Trinimac was one such ancestor. (After being eaten and excreted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Boethiah</a>, Trinimac would become the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemons">AreDifferent Daedric Prince</a> of<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheOtherReindeer">outcasts</a> Malacath, and his followers became the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a>.)

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a>, led by the religious extremist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a>, a faction of elven supremacists, have forced the Empire to ban the worship of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">Talos</a>, leading to the Stormcloak rebellion. The "official" reason for this ban is that the Thalmor believe that they descend from the Aedra and refuse to accept that a human could join their ranks. The unofficial reason is because they play up Altmeri religious beliefs which state that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence">the creation of the mortal world was a cruel trick which robbed their ancestors of pre-creation divinity</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They believe that Talos is one of the last things keeping the mortal world extant, and if he is destroyed, the mortal world would be destroyed as well, allowing them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">return to a divine state</a>.</span> There is also evidence that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">they aren't completely wrong about this</a>. Furthermore, it's possible that Talos isn't quite a god in the same way as the other Divines are, and he may have even surpassed them (and the Daedra as well). It's quite possible that he no longer even <em>needs</em> prayer.
</li><li> There's a rather good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> for <em>Skyrim</em> that uses this trope as a gameplay mechanic, called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545">Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. You can devote your character to a deity and gain their favour by praying to them regularly and following their tenets to get special powers specific to the deity you worship, and lose it by neglecting to pray or breaking the tenets. At 100% Favour you gain a special active ability that is very powerful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust">and at 0% Favour the deity abandons you</a>. There are many deities to choose from: the Nine Divines build Favour slowly and apply more passive bonuses, but also can be appeased by simple prayer and are unlikely to abandon a faithful unless they egregiously defy the tenets or neglect worship. By contrast, followers of the Daedric Princes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">can gain impressive active powers very quickly but must perform strict tasks to stay in their good graces (and many of these tasks are illegal, immoral and/or deeply detrimental)</a> - for example, Peryite can let you learn all skills at a much faster rate but the only way to gain his favour is to afflict yourself with diseases and trying to cure them can see Him abandoning you, Sanguine gives you a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoozeBasedBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoozeBasedBuff">booze based healing power</a> but requires you to drinks tons of alcohol and flout the laws of the land for his amusement, and Boethiah can give you superior Daedra Invisibility for a time but He will want you to often <em>murder innocent people</em>. There are also race-specific deities, like the Khajiiti and Redguard pantheons, the Elven Ancestors, the Nord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">War God</a> Shor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Sithis and Mannimarco</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawlStoneSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawlStoneSoup">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a>, the amorphous god Jiyva has exactly one follower.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a></em>'s gameplay is built on this trope. Each god is called into existence by a single pure prayer and gains power by convincing villages to believe in it above all other gods; a god who loses all its followers vanishes in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic">Puff of Logic</a>. Additionally, villagers who actively worship at temples and altars generate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> for their god, which enables it to cast Miracles.
</li><li> Power-ups in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> come from the praise you get for performing miracles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And at the end, Ammy gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a> through people praying directly to her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown">Purely cosmetic, though.</a></span> Overall, this trope seems to be one of the game's underlying themes, as it's mentioned quite early on how people's faith in the divine has dwindled.

In the game's tie-in comic, Wonder Woman suggests Ares become the god of something else in order to regain his powers, then hilariously calls him, "Ares, God of Ponies". In the game proper, Ares decides to help the heroes, explaining that their struggle against the Regime is empowering him in the short-term, but if the bad guys win, conflict will drop completely.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></em> the gods are powered by worship. This doesn't come up very much, because they have plenty of worshipers. All of them except Jiyva the Shapeless, god of slimes. There's only one slime smart enough to worship it and if you kill it, unless you yourself are for some reason a follower of Jiyva, the god ceases to exist.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a>: A Realm Reborn</em>, the Primals are brought forth from the aetheric flow by the worship of their followers.

<ul><li> The post-launch patches and first expansion extrapolate on the nature of Primals revealing them to be figments made real more than actual deities, making them closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> than true gods. While they do require worship to be sustained, they are not divine so much as they are very, <em>very</em> powerful beings made from magic that take a form and personality in lieu of whatever their followers believe them to be. The strength of the Primal is determined by a combination of how fervent the prayers of its followers are, and how strong the source of magic being used to summon them is.
<ul><li> This is how the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">justifies its hard mode encounters</a>; not only are the Primals able to be resummoned if slain, but stronger sources of magic and more fervent prayers from their followers create stronger incarnations.

If their fairy tale is popular among "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">mundies</a>", then that belief makes the Fable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">very resistant to physical injury</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">capable of healing very quickly</a>.

</li><li> <em>Everquest</em> has two examples.
<ul><li> Mayong Mistmoore ascends to Godhood because having a raiding party assembled to defeat him somehow counts as worship. When killed, his disembodied voice says "You have martyred me, you have worshipped me." The next several expansions deal with the repercussions until he's defeated again.

By the time of your arrival, only the Three are still left standing, reduced to mindless rotting husks that attack you on sight even if you are one of their worshippers.

The current pantheon is made up of the gods that win often enough that their divinity isn't immediately in peril (and there's no sign of a clear winner in sight), but all of them have no choice but to keep manipulating the war for eternity.

<ul><li> The Heroic Spirits (not outright gods but at least a few levels of spiritualism above humans) mostly exist due to - and are partially sustained and empowered by - the belief they've inspired in humanity. Their strength appears based partly on their actual power and partly on pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a>. As Rin explains in the game prologue, even fictional characters count, what matters is the image created by the minds of the people. The game features two major explorations of this - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Assassin is a nameless samurai called forth to play the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SasakiKojiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SasakiKojiro">Sasaki Kojiro</a>, an opponent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a></span>, who is entirely fictional in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a>. In other words, the pure belief that humanity has in the existence of said hero is so strong that it allows him to exist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">albeit through summoning a nameless spirit to take on his name and fill his role</span>. On the flip side, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Archer (EMIYA) is a hero from the future</span>; nobody knows of his existence and he therefore owes neither his existence nor any of his powers from belief, persisting as a Heroic Spirit only through the connection all Heroic Spirits have with the earth itself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Heracles</a>, naturally, gets top billing either way you look at it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> (the very first Heroic Spirit) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> also rank highly, as does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Iskander</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>.
</li><li> To clarify a bit, if a person gains enough acknowledgement in the minds of humanity at large - be it as a Hero, Villian, or Anti-Hero - , real or imagined, they go to the afterlife known as the Throne of Heroes, rather than what happens to normal souls. Once there, they become pseudo-deific spirits of enormous power known as Heroic Spirits. As the Throne exists outside of time, all Heroic Spirits, past, present, and future, dwell there, even after being completely forgotten. That said, a Heroic Spirit's power(as well as their specific Noble Phantasms. Such as, King Arthur's Excalibur is the most famous part of his legend. So naturally it is more powerful than another, such as Rhongomyniad, another weapon of his, yet a far more obscure one) increases the most people know about it. So while being forgotten won't kill or destroy them, being remembered makes them stronger. It even happens on a local level. Hercules is a famous Heroic Spirit worldwide, so when he is summoned as Berserker in Japan, he retains a far greater portion of his powers than Cú Chulainn - Lancer - who would normally be capable of going head-to-head with him, but is so obscure in Japan that he holds only a fraction of his normal strength. This has lead to him being dubbed by fans as "the Most Useless Servant in the War". For a bit of context, when Vlad the Impaler is summoned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Fate/Apocrypha</a></em>, he is at about 60% power outside of Transylvania, and he's famous worldwide for inspiring the Legend of Dracula. Cú Chulainn, on the other hand, is so obscenely obscure outside of Northern Europe that it's unlikely that people from anywhere else had even heard of him before watching this.
</li><li> Don't overestimate this sort of power, however. While the overall belief that the world possesses in a Heroic Spirit can certainly increase their power if summoned, they can still easily lose to a less-known Servant by virtue of simply possessing an inferior skillset to said opponent. There's a reason that Cú Chulainn, despite his relatively unknown nature in Japan, can still take on someone with the fame of King Arthur, Medusa, or even Heracles in a fight and have a good chance of coming out victorious, or someone like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">EMIYA</span> can defeat Gilgamesh due to the specifics of their Noble Phantasms. Skill is just as necessary in a fight as power, after all.
</li><li> The actual gods of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a> also experienced this. While some existed before there were beings who could believe in them, many Divine Spirits were created by the belief of humanity. As time passed and worship waned, they faded and became weaker Elementals, or ceased to exist. Gilgamesh was created by the gods of ancient Mesopotamia in a vain attempt to stop this from happening to them. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">saw that the gods were oppressing humanity</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">instead hastened their end</a>.
</li><li> The Greek Gods/Olympians play with this. In their original forms, they didn't need worship because their power was innate to their beings <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">as giant divine mecha</a></span> and worship simply served to bolster them further. After a certain incident involving the White Titan Sefar about 14,000 years before the present-day, however, their original bodies were destroyed but their spirits lingered on, at which point they became dependent on human worship to anchor and maintain their existence. But it wasn't all bad as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">this allowed them to develop human emotions due to constant contact with humans</a></span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fans">Fans!</a></em> has the occasional god make an appearance. These gods usually claim they were conceived by Roman clergy, during nights with a little too much wine. These gods include the god of gaming, and the anti-cupid (who shoots you with a tommy-gun and takes away your devotion to another person).
</li><li> Being partially based on 40K, the Gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExterminatusNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExterminatusNow">Exterminatus Now</a></em> work this way. Daemons, or at least <a class="urllink" href="http://exterminatusnow.co.uk/2012-08-05/comic/the-bookend-of-unimaginable-power/australian-rules-chessmaster/">former mortals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, supposedly do as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> universe in general employs this trope to explain any god not in the three original pantheons. In particular, Elan and some orcs are Banjoists, worshippers of Banjo the Clown, god of puppets. He doesn't have many followers, so his divine lightning is little more than a spark. One of the prequel books reveals that mortal characters can ascend to godhood in this manner.
<ul><li> Since Elan was unwilling to leave Banjo (who is an actual puppet) with the orcs, he creates Banjo's twin brother and rival, Giggles the Clown, as the god of slapstick. The violence-loving orcs appreciate this, and immediately convert. So Banjo went back down to a single worshipper, but since they were defined as equally powerful rivals, that probably remains the case. The OotS-verse has established that being defined as a rival gives free XP to keep one side from being too weak for the role.
</li><li> Elan once tried to get Banjo inducted into the Northern Pantheon, specifically to gain more worshippers. The local priest angrily rejected this idea, and Elan then decided Banjo was too good for their pantheon, unaware that Odin (who likes puppets) approved of the idea.
</li><li> Similarly, several elves and one goblin (the Dark One) became so revered after their deaths that they ascended to godhood.
</li><li> Longrunning movie snacks like Popcorn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Milk Dudes [sic],</a> and Soda have apparently gained power "like unto tiny refreshing GODS!" from generations of popularity.
</li><li> Later, it is explained in more detail that gods need four things from mortals:
<ul><li> <strong>Belief</strong> that the god exists.
</li><li> Active <strong>Worship</strong>.
</li><li> <strong>Dedication</strong>, which is described as a big burst when a mortal dies and is sent to their deity.
</li><li> <strong>Souls</strong> of the deceased, where their presence powers the Outer Planes and the afterlife.
</li><li> Gods need a specific balance of these things to maintain their "health" — Hel, who gets a lot of dedication when mortals are sent to her realm but little to no worship of any sort, is described as being particularly messed up due to this imbalance. Gods who don't have significant stores of belief, worship, dedication and souls on standby can also fail to survive prolonged "dry spells". This tends to happen to newly-ascended gods <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the interim between the Snarl destroying a world and it calming enough to be trapped again.</span>
</li><li> On a more comedic note, the comic uses this concept to explain why Odin is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Cloud Cuckoolander</a> in this comic: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the last iteration of the universe, the Northerners were barbarians who disdained magic<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4go26');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4go26" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4go26');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em></span>. Since Odin is the Northern god of magic, this left him starved of belief and seemingly affects him like Alzheimer's. According to Thor, he should be back to normal in a few centuries now that he has proper worshipers again.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheGodsOfArrKelaan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheGodsOfArrKelaan">The Gods of Arr-Kelaan</a></em> gain power from their followers, but mostly they provide their own (considerable) power.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the Abrahamic god is shown to be a concept created by a pantheon of minor gods in order to conserve the lessening magic in our world.
</li><li> The Traveler Gods actually gain power from worshipers in a slightly sideways manner - worship itself doesn't grant the gods more power, but deceased souls that have an affinity for them (including those that were never worshipers, or never even heard of them) are drawn to their afterlives to seek enlightenment through exploration of some state of being (such as through learning for Claremont, the god of Science). As souls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a> on achieving enlightenment, the gods gather power from the act of ascension. It's in their interests more to promote their portfolios rather than their faiths - Claremont would get more power from fostering a love of learning worldwide rather than creating an authoritarian church to enforce his dogma.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ParallelDementia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ParallelDementia">Parallel Dementia</a></em>, most nightmares (read: supernatural beings) gain power from belief. This also works for humans, as demonstrated by a legendary assassin who faked her death who still gains power from people believing in her former name, Mistress of Blades.
</li><li> A slight variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Underling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Underling">Underling</a></em>, in that they are powered by knowledge of them, even more so belief.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>, Coyote believes that this is how he came into existence. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGod">Whether or not this is TRUE is another matter entirely.</a> That said, with what happened to the Native Americans, it's clear lack of worshippers doesn't diminish the power of something that has gained it (assuming Coyote's theory is true).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TooMuchInformation2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TooMuchInformation2005">Too Much Information (2005)</a></em> some spirits can become Astrals by having enough worshipers. Losing those worshipers causes them to die.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TrueVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TrueVillains">True Villains</a></em>, there is a god of everything, but only five have any real power because they are believed in and worshiped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Twokinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Twokinds">Twokinds</a></em>: The gods are waging proxy wars to determine which of their creations will become the apex species. Since the humans worship one god (name unknown so far) and the keidran worship Neutral, it's implied that the extinction of a species means the respective god will die or be weakened from a lack of followers. Furthermore, it's implied that the god of the Basitins made his creations extremely obedient so they would always follow the rules, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">but they were so obedient that they worshiped the law instead of their god and starved them to death.</a>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Chitra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Chitra">Chitra</a></em>, Phobinus the God of Beauty wants to become a major player in his world's pantheon, like the God of Lightning or the God of War. To do this, he needs his apostle Chitra to attract faithful devotees to live in his kingdom (and eventually expand the territory). The more devotees a god has, the more powerful they become. In a flashback conversation between advisor Tornian (a native of the land) and Chitra (a girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Isekai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Isekai">from 21st century Earth</a>) in Chapter 37, Tornian compares belief in the gods to a form of currency among the divine:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Tornian</strong>: A god's power will increase with the number of believers they have. Devotion is like currency to them, like money is for humans.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Chitra</strong>: Then let's say, in an extreme situation, that all those believers die. What will happen?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Tornian</strong>: Since forgetting about something is the same as it disappearing, I assume that the god will cease to exist.

After escaping imprisonment (by whom hasn't yet been revealed) into the modern world, the old gods of Olympus find themselves greatly weakened and without worshippers to draw power from, and end up having to take mortal hosts. Who in the present day form their own loose school clique at Whateley Academy...
<ul><li> It's also been mentioned in the canon background material that even simple spirits (basically considered randomly occurring self-motivated 'knots' of magical energy) may be able to evolve into 'gods' over time if given a source of worship to draw on.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/Adylheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/Adylheim">Adylheim</a></em>: the less powerful gods require constant supplication and sacrifices to be made in their honour, whereas the more powerful ones merely use this as something of a divine power up. In return they're usually inclined to offer everything from providence to small miracles.
</li><li> Because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> maneuver by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/MetamorCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/MetamorCity">Metamor City</a></em> setting, the old gods of the pantheon are now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">physical gods</a> and have lost most of their strength and power. They gain some of their power back by way of worship from mortal souls.
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MetamorKeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MetamorKeep">Metamor Keep</a></em> setting, where the gods are at the height of their power, they draw power from faith and actions done in their name. Though aside from the priesthood most worshipers only pray when they need something, and such favors often have a significantly higher cost.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Inglip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Inglip">Inglip</a></em> meme (for sufficient meta values of "followers" - an Inglip comic maker declaring himself as Gropaga will - mostly - let Inglip win, same for the other cults and gods).
</li><li> Horror artist Trevor Henderson, also known as "Slimyswampghost" on Tumblr, naturally plays this for horror with his recurring monster <a class="urllink" href="http://slimyswampghost.tumblr.com/tagged/chicken-ghost">the Chicken Ghost<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He states in supplementary material that the Chicken Ghost was originally known as "The God of Chickens" and was a deity representing and protecting poultry. Now long-forgotten, the Chicken Ghost is no longer prayed to or worshiped, which led to him losing most of his powers. This is also likely the reason for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">bizarre and mangled appearance</a>.

A mysterious figure, clearly terrorized by his presence, attacks him but is too weak and decrepit to put up any resistance. After Lion-O assures him that he is not a thief, the creature introduces himself as Maftet the Lynx God, explaining that millennia ago he was a much-renowned god, but that his power has withered to virtually nothing after enduring many centuries without having been worshipped. He goes on to explain that <em>anyone</em> can become a god, even Lion-O if he felt like it, but few attempt it as without worshippers, this is certain doom.
