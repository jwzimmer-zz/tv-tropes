<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> is a bit of a strange case. This and most other works about Pocahontas are based on the writings of John Smith, which are commonly believed to be true. However, research into Smith's other works quickly reveals this to be bunk, because Smith had a habit of portraying himself as an entirely unrealistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue">demi-god of manliness and combat skill who found success, riches and sex wherever he went</a>. It was also problematic in that Smith claimed Pocahontas was only about 12 years old when they met. Disney eventually decided to go this route on purpose, throwing out their research and making the film into a "legend" rather than a true story. It still doesn't change the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>'s engraving of the historical Pocahontas/Rebecca Rolfe (who was at the time of the engraving about 21) has a lot more in common with voodoo god Baron Saturday than with the Disney hottie.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Films — Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Early documentarians did this quite a bit:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NanookOfTheNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NanookOfTheNorth">Nanook of the North</a></em>, Robert Flaherty's 1922 portrait of life among the Inuit of the northern Hudson Bay, is considered the first documentary film. However, virtually everything that happens in the film was staged in accordance with a story Flaherty drew up himself. "Nanook" was really named Allakariallak, the two women shown in the movie were not really his wives, and he died of tuberculosis rather than starvation. The film portrayed an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimoLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimoLand">Eskimo Land</a> life in which the Inuit wore parkas and hunted with spears, when the real Inuit had been wearing Western clothing and hunting with firearms for many years. And the famous scene of Nanook fighting a seal through a hole in the ice was totally staged — other Inuit were pulling on the fishing line off-screen, and they had a dead seal on hand for the last shot in the scene.
</li><li> The 1927 documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chang">Chang</a></em> takes a similar approach, with the Lao of northern Thailand acting out a story crafted by the filmmakers. Incidents like the tiger attack and the herd of elephants trampling the village were staged for the cameras — the elephants were even tamed and had to be coaxed into trampling the natives' huts.
</li></ul></li><li> The original 1974 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em> was supposedly based on a true story, but no such "massacre" ever took place. Leatherface is allegedly loosely based on the killer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gszh');"><sup>because technically </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gszh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gszh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he can't be called a "serial killer", as the FBI's definition requires a person to kill at least three people (with a "cooldown" period between the murders), and Gein had only two murders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance">that they could prove in court</a>.</span> Ed Gein, but there's isn't that much linking the two. The director mentions in the DVD commentary that the dates on which the fictional events supposedly occur correspond somewhat with the dates that they were filming the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanHaunting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanHaunting">An American Haunting</a></em>, based on a book by the same name about the Bell Witch of Tennessee, has problems. Lots of them. There's been no historical evidence found to indicate John Bell ever sexually abused his daughter, just for starters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo">Fargo</a></em> has gone all over the place:
<ul><li> The film explicitly claims in a blurb at the beginning that it's based on a true story. It isn't. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoenBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoenBrothers">The Coen Brothers</a> (after changing their story a couple of times) eventually tried to weasel their way out of it by saying that everything in the movie was meant to be interpreted as fiction — including the blurb that claimed it was based on a true story. On the DVD extras, the Coens also claimed that they were afraid nobody would believe the crazy plot <em>unless</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakierThanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakierThanFiction">they said it was a true story</a>. The Coens' most repeated lie was that the film was based on a 1987 news story about a businessman who planned on having his wife fake-kidnapped for ransom money, but the police caught him before he could bring his plan to fruition, and the Coens got curious and asked themselves, "what if he <em>had</em> succeeded?"
</li><li> This led to a <em>different</em> movie getting this treatment — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KumikoTheTreasureHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KumikoTheTreasureHunter">Kumiko The Treasure Hunter</a></em> was based on a story that a Japanese woman, who was found dead in the area in 2001, believed the movie was real and was looking for a large sum of money that a character had hidden (and which was lost when he was murdered), but got lost herself and froze to death. In fact, she almost certainly committed suicide, and the treasure-hunter story was likely a misinterpretation of a conversation she had had with a police officer.
</li></ul></li><li> The horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStrangers">The Strangers</a></em>, about a masked trio of psychopaths who stalk, terrorize, and eventually murder a couple in a vacation home, is supposedly based on a true story, but it was primarily inspired by an incident from the director's childhood in which a pair of "strangers" came to the door and were later found to be breaking into houses if no one was home when they knocked. It also took cues from an actual set of unsolved murders, but they were absolutely nothing like the plot of the movie — while staying in a cabin in a resort town, a woman in her thirties, two of her children, and a friend of one of the children were mysteriously bludgeoned and stabbed to death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hidalgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hidalgo">Hidalgo</a></em> is based on the actual stories of Frank Hopkins — but Hopkins is known to history as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen">con man</a> and quite possibly a pathological liar. Hopkins was <em>not</em> part Native American, did not ever work in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, never visited the Middle East (and certainly was never in a gigantic race in the Middle East, which no one can prove even happened in the first place). On some level, however, you've got to admire the guy for inventing a story that Hollywood thought was worthy of a movie, given that so many have tried and failed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmityvilleHorror1979" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmityvilleHorror1979">The Amityville Horror (1979)</a></em> is supposedly based on a true story documented in the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmityvilleHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmityvilleHorror">The Amityville Horror</a></em>. However, the book's author admitted that it was at least somewhat exaggerated. Debate still rages as to which parts of the book really happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHauntingInConnecticut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHauntingInConnecticut">The Haunting In Connecticut</a></em> purports to be based on a true story. However, Ray Garton, the author of the book that the film (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel">Discovery Channel</a> documentary) was based on, has admitted that the "true story" was a fabrication. He has said that none of the family members could get their story straight, and that they were dealing with alcoholism and drug addiction at the time, which may have affected their judgment. He brought his concerns to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the case investigators and self-professed "demonologists" (who, not coincidentally, also investigated the Amityville case); they reportedly told him to "make it up and make it scary."

It's Alioto's remake of his little-seen 1989 horror film called <em>UFO Abduction</em> — little-seen because the master copy of the film, along with most VHS tapes and promotional materials, were <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130607045143/http://www.badmovieplanet.com/3btheater/a/alienabductionII.html">destroyed in a warehouse fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The few VHS tapes were circulated to small video stores across the U.S., and in the early 1990s, they resurfaced in ufologist circles (with the beginning and end credits removed) purporting to be an account of an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">Alien Abduction</a> that came to be called "the McPherson Tape". Programs like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Encounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Encounters">Encounters</a></em> started to contact Alioto, trying to get him to admit to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionAsCoverUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionAsCoverUp">part of the cover-up</a>; the executives essentially wanted to capitalize on this publicity and told Alioto to say in the remake that the abduction was real.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingArthur">King Arthur</a></em> is billed as the true historical story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>, but instead is little more than a "remix" of the popular Arthur mythos with some garbled bits of Late Roman/Early Medieval history. Whether there was a historical Arthur at all remains a matter of fierce historical debate, and there are several potential candidates for the basis of the character, none of which bear more than a surface similarity to the movie's Arthur. It's not exactly a success as a "true historical story" either — the entire movie is one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory">long</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">historical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">inaccuracy</a>. Heck, the title character himself lived (<em>if</em> he lived) in the century after the events of the movie are supposed to take place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> is another example of a "historical" film claiming to be accurate but which doesn't even depict events which are certain to have happened and is instead based on mythology. But this one is trickier to pin down because of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> and the sense that it's the kind of exaggeration the historical Spartans themselves would have told and appreciated. Those involved with the project (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a>) are inconsistent as to whether this is supposed to be an accurate depiction of historical events, a dramatization of those events, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">an accurate historical depiction of a dramatization of those events.</a>
</li><li> <em>Cobb</em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyLeeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyLeeJones">Tommy Lee Jones</a>, is about the last days of controversial baseball legend Ty Cobb. It's based on the account of sportswriter Al Stump, who ghotstwrote Cobb's memoir and later wrote a magazine article about Cobb's final months. As a coup de grace, Stump wrote another, much, <em>much</em> less complimentary biography, titled, <em>Cobb: The Life and Times of the Meanest Man Who Ever Played Baseball</em>. In the years since, Stump's version of events has been debunked as fiction. Cobb was <em>not</em> a nice person by any means, but Stump describes events that never happened. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-knife-in-ty-cobbs-back-65618032/">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> outlines some of the falsehoods.
</li><li> Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, the very first film claiming to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm">Snuff Film</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">imaginatively</a> entitled <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/snuff/">Snuff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>) purported to depict the actual on-camera murder of an actress. Despite all the controversy that was stirred up — which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">the entire point</a> — the murder was later revealed to be a hoax, and not a very convincing one at that. (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Snuff_1976.aspx?Page=9">See for yourself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; the "snuff footage" looked <em>unbelievably</em> fake.) In fact, the distributors of the movie had just bought some random South American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a>, <em>Slaughter</em> (1971), and grafted on their own completely different short bit of footage (the "snuff"), replacing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">actual movie's ending</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em> did this with its marketing campaign, claiming that the three actors were all killed by the eponymous Blair Witch, and that the footage detailed their final days. It helped that the actors use their real names in the movie, as if they're filming a real documentary on the subject. However, no such Blair Witch has ever existed, and all three actors were perfectly fine. The actors were told to deliberately not attend screenings or events related to the movie to make it seem as if they were really dead. It worked for a while, until the film became a massive success — it made its minimal budget back almost <em>ten thousand times</em> over, and it still holds the world record for the highest cost-to-profit margin in movie history. After that, the actors couldn't resist the temptation to start appearing on late-night talk shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalHolocaust">Cannibal Holocaust</a></em>:
<ul><li> Predating <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, its early days advertised it as "real footage". This time, though, people were so outraged that the director was arrested and charged with murder. He had to admit in court that it was all a great big lie. In order to prove this, he had to get the actors to show up in court to prove that they were alive and well; this was a difficult task because the actors' contracts with the studio <em>required</em> them to keep away from the public eye for a full year to fuel the illusion that they were dead. Much legal wrangling ensued.
</li><li> Within the film itself, the documentary crew were a particularly brutal case of this. They would often report on the violence of the natives they were filming to give the image of them being savages... by <em>performing</em> violent actions on the natives and then claiming they did it (up to and including rape and murder). This leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bullying a Dragon</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai">The Last Samurai</a></em> is based on an odd amalgamation of the historical Satsuma Rebellion and the part played in the earlier Boshin War by French officer Jules Brunet. It also borrows heavily from other fictional works, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves">Dances with Wolves</a></em> and James Clavell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun">Shogun</a></em>. The "guns vs. swords" plot is particularly ironic, considering that even the real "last samurai" of the Satsuma Rebellion openly embraced modern weaponry for the tactical advantages it offered.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0iauo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0iauo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0iauo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For a period of time prior to the unification of Japan, samurai (and the peasant soldiers serving under their command) used guns more prolifically than any other group on Earth. Any reluctance to use guns was simply to reserve them for serious crises.</span> The decline of the samurai class in real life came about in a much slower and less dramatic fashion and there were certainly no embittered American Civil War heroes involved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus">Amadeus</a></em> was based on an apocryphal tale claiming Salieri, a contemporary of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, went mad late in his life and confessed to killing Mozart. It is a matter of historical record that Mozart died during a long period of illness. The film accepts <em>both</em> of these stories as true; Salieri is painted as a jealous competitor to Mozart who hated the man but adored his genius, and he "kills" him by encouraging a naive Mozart suffering from illness to make more music. The filmmakers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyPlottedAPerfectlyGoodWaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyPlottedAPerfectlyGoodWaste">did this intentionally</a>, finding it great fodder for a story. However, the film is forced to stretch the truth to reach this result; Mozart and Salieri may have been professional rivals, but they respected each other's skills, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35589422">and even collaborated to produce a contata in 1785<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The film shows Salieri working on the Requiem Mass with Mozart, when there is no evidence that he did so (it is unknown how much of the piece Mozart wrote, but it was finished by Franz Xavier Süssmayer); it also implies that Salieri was the anonymous patron who commissioned the Requiem Mass, when we now know that it was Count Franz von Walsegg.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1aqgk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1aqgk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1aqgk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Interestingly, the real-life scenario is also plausible in the film; it never shows Salieri as the patron or even that he set it up. All it shows is that Salieri was not above exploiting the situation to ensure that the Requiem Mass was written.</span> In any event, the writers were willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">do the research</a> on everything else in the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIrishman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIrishman">The Irishman</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> is based on the book <em>I Heard You Paint Houses</em> about one Frank Sheeran. Sheeran claimed he was a Mafia hitman who, among other things, participated in the murder of Jimmy Hoffa. The publishers were still claiming the book was a true story as of the film's release in 2019, but most historians believe Sheeran's stories to be fabrications.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PicnicAtHangingRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PicnicAtHangingRock">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a></em> is an adaptation of a novel that tried its very best to pretend it was true.
</li></ul><ul><li> The sci-fi/horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthKind">The Fourth Kind</a></em> has, as its tag line, the claim that the movie is "based on actual case studies," and even claims to include actual footage of alien abductions. Guess what? <a class="urllink" href="http://io9.com/5397359/the-fourth-kind-is-a-hoax">It's a hoax.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMenWhoStareAtGoats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMenWhoStareAtGoats">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a></em> begins with an assurance that "more of the film is true than we would believe." Which part? Sure, there <em>was</em> a remote viewing project in the U.S. military around the late '70s and early '80s, but it didn't work. The founder of the New Earth Army was also responsible for the Army's slogan "Be all that you can be." The movie is actually a fictionalization of a fairly well-documented journalistic book. The assurance is probably a joke, given that it is immediately followed by a very straight-laced military man calmly and deliberately stepping away from his desk and running head-on into a wall for no apparent reason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked">The Boat That Rocked</a></em> is actually an amalgamation of different stories; "Radio Rock" could refer to several different outfits that broadcast from a boat outside British waters. The one actually called "Radio Rock" did annoy the British government, but it also had a license and thus technically wasn't a "pirate" radio station at all. The others were actual pirate radio stations, in particular <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Caroline">Radio Caroline<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was infamous not only for broadcasting offshore from a boat without a license, but also for its ability to weather some astonishing mishaps, from being raided by British and Dutch authorities to their boats sinking (likely an inspiration for the film's climax). The film's ending is a bit more dramatic than the real one, when the government basically banned anyone from supplying them and waited for the crew to give up and come ashore, when they were promptly arrested. All this being said, former pirate DJs have said that the film does capture the flavour of shipboard life quite well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleshipPotemkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleshipPotemkin">Battleship Potemkin</a></em> is a purportedly historical film that depicts a massacre that, in truth, never happened; records are scarce and conflicting, and eyewitnesses were unreliable and confused. However, what we do know is that spirits in the city were running high at that moment, and there <em>were</em> several demonstrations that, by some accounts (including those of a British consul and a <em>Times</em> reporter) were put down using armed troops, but no massacre. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeiEisenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeiEisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a> knew he wasn't making a documentary, but rather a propaganda flick, so he took really great liberties with the facts — including the massacre. It's just that in doing so, he had several ideas how to edit the footage for maximum emotional impact, which worked so well that he basically became the father of all modern film editing, and the Odessa Steps Massacre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">became firmly entrenched as a fact</a>. It was even said that after seeing the movie, someone who was there turned himself into police in the U.S. and confessed to a murder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bloodsport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bloodsport">Bloodsport</a></em> is based on Frank Dux's claims of having won a secret underground fighting competition. There is simply no evidence that any part of Dux's outrageous story actually took place. Even the trophy he claims to have won was purchased by him at a local shop. The film ends with a bunch of "records" that Dux supposedly achieved during his bloodsport career, which in a world educated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> now look fairly absurd. Some aspects of Dux's story aren't even possible, such as his claim that he defeated 52 other fighters (in fights "to the death") to win the tournament, which would imply a single-elimination tournament with 4.5 <em>quadrillion</em> participants (<em>i.e.</em> more human beings than have ever <em>existed</em>). Several people have also pointed out that the story bears quite a few similarities to the equally false claims of Count Dante, aka John Keenan, who in the 60s and early 70s professed to win a tournament to the death no one can prove existed.
</li><li> <em>China Cry: A True Story</em> is desperate enough to claim it really happened in its <em>title</em>. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101578/">reports it as "based on a true story"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is in spite of it depicting several incidents of divine intervention, which <a class="urllink" href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0090a.html">aren't very well-supported<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=lam">by the evidence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> The epilogue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheToolboxMurders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheToolboxMurders">The Toolbox Murders</a></em> states the film was based on a true story, though near the end of the credits the usual "this was fiction, all resemblance to anything real is just coincidental" disclaimer is shown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates">Enemy at the Gates</a></em> presents an interesting example: Jude Law's sniper character was a real person, and, surprisingly, so was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> played by Rachel Weisz. But the same can't be said of the German sniper and the main plot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedsWithRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedsWithRockets">Soviet officials</a> insisted the story was true, but recent reappraisals of the available evidence have led historians to strongly suspect that the whole thing was just a load of made-up wartime propaganda. The villain of the piece is a Bavarian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziNobleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziNobleman">aristocrat</a> sniper named Erwin Konig; in reality, no conclusive evidence has been found that Konig ever even <em>existed</em>, let alone that he fought a sniper duel in Stalingrad.
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em> inverts this by providing a disclaimer at the beginning of the film to the effect that "According to repeated statements by both Soviet and American governments, <em>nothing</em> of what you are about to see <em>ever</em> happened." The audience is quite pointedly left to draw their own conclusions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For the record, it didn't happen.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> The majority of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK">JFK</a></em> is entirely made up, with the only real events being the assassination and the Clay Shaw trial (which was an affront to justice). Perhaps the worst made-up element was the crucial "smoke from the grassy knoll"; none of the rifles used would emit any visible smoke, so Oliver Stone had to have a special-effects man <em>blow smoke out of a bellows</em> in order to get that effect (and <em>many</em> commentators would joke about him literally "blowing smoke"). Most of the film's facts are taken from the writings of Jim Garrison, who is also the central character in the film. Almost every expert on the Kennedy assassination — even those who believe in a conspiracy — believe Garrison to be unreliable at best and insane at worst.
</li><li> The 2012 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilInside">The Devil Inside</a></em>, a horror film about demonic possession, is said to be based on actual events. The film even ends on a cliffhanger saying the murders that took place in the film are still under investigation and directing viewers to a website for more information. The home video release bills itself as "the movie The Vatican doesn't want you to see." (Neither do quite a few movie critics, who considered it a candidate for worst film of the year.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePossession">The Possession</a></em> is said to be based on a true story of a little girl who was possessed by the <em>dibbuk</em>, a Hebrew demon that lived in a cursed box. There's one glaring problem: no little girl ever owned the box, and the guy who bought it was an adult male (who claimed the demon made him sever his fingers and those of his roommates).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEnglishmanWhoWentUpAHillButCameDownAMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEnglishmanWhoWentUpAHillButCameDownAMountain">The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain</a></em> bills itself as being based on a true story. It's actually based on a local legend, which has since been totally discredited. The film even ends with a shot of the modern residents of the village rebuilding the mound that had supposedly been built by their ancestors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIceman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIceman">The Iceman</a></em> is based on the prison confessions of Richard Kuklinski, who told a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen">colorful tales</a> about being a prolific mob hitman responsible for hundreds of murders using a variety of bizarre methods. The problem is that almost none of Kuklinski's claims (including having killed Jimmy Hoffa) have been verified by any actual evidence, and some are outright refuted. He was almost certainly a lowly psychopath who liked attention rather than a legendary assassin.
</li><li> The 1977 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Julia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Julia">Julia</a></em>, supposedly "based on a true story," was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LillianHellman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LillianHellman">Lillian Hellman</a>'s memoir <em>Pentimento</em>, which was, to put it kindly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a> in which Hellman didn't actually play a part. In 1979, Mary McCarthy, long Hellman's adversary, said of Hellman that "every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourClosed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourClosed">4Closed</a></em> claimed to be based on a story of someone living in a hidden room of a foreclosed house, but no such scenario is known to have happened.

Surprisingly, the film's iconic "win one for the Gipper" halftime speech is actually more or less accurate, being based on a real speech that Rockne gave his team at halftime of a 1928 game against Army. The problem is that Rockne based the <em>speech</em> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotivationalLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotivationalLie">Motivational Lie</a>; he wasn't even there when Gipp died, and Gipp never said any such thing. This makes the film's depiction of Gipp's death highly dramatized, although not quite intentionally so.

It's a bit confusing; the "incredibly true" part refers to an in-universe play which, according to the characters' descriptions, is about a lesbian romance that's based on a true story (but in-universe).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VirginiaCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VirginiaCity">Virginia City</a></em> starts with a peculiar title card saying that while the characters are fictional, the story of 73 Confederate sympathizers trying to smuggle a bunch of gold out of Nevada is true. It isn't.

Thanks to a little digging by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a>, it was exposed as bearing about as much resemblance to the facts as <em>Pocahontas</em> has to its real-life origin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaturdayNightFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaturdayNightFever">Saturday Night Fever</a></em> was based on Nik Cohn's article "Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night," about Cohn witnessing a fight outside the 2001 Odyssey disco. 20 years after the article's publication, Cohn admitted it was complete fiction.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Roots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Roots">Roots</a></em>, Alex Haley's history of his family, was a bestseller and adapted into a hugely popular TV miniseries. While Haley's book was classified as a novel and much of the plot was Haley's invention, he claimed that he had in fact traced his ancestry to a Mandinka warrior named Kunta Kinte who was kidnapped by slavers and sold into slavery in the American South when he was seventeen years old. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family#Historical_accuracy">notes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, most of the follow-up research contradicts Haley's story. There is little basis in fact for Haley's account of his history prior to his great-great-grandfather "Chicken George" Lea.
</li><li> In the 1970s, the book <em>The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</em> (titled <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em> in the United States) claimed to reveal the truth of a relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene that was hidden in various Renaissance paintings. It was later revealed to be completely fictional, but not before hundreds of thousands of people had been conned:
<ul><li> First, it's not entirely original in and of itself; it's based on earlier stories about the town of Rennes-le-Château, which were invented as a publicity stunt by local restaurateur Noël Corbu. Pierre Plantard would later spin Corbu's story into the mythical Priory of Scion.
</li><li> Second, it got hit by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em>, which used the same mythology and caused an identical resurgence in public interest in it. <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> doesn't exactly rip off <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em>, and it in fact name-drops the book as one of Teabing's resources on the Grail.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2o40n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2o40n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2o40n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And "Teabing", by the way, is an anagram of "Baigent", one of the authors of <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em></span> However, the authors of <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em> amusingly saw fit to sue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanBrown">Dan Brown</a> for copyright infringement. They ran into a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>: if the story is real, it's not copyrightable and Brown could use it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. So if they wanted to win the case, they had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose">admit they made it up</a>, and they didn't want to do that (not that it would have worked, as the idea is general enough that it's <em>still</em> not copyright infringement). But Dan Brown, not content with winning the case, <em>himself</em> started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanBrowned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanBrowned">claiming it was all real</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lucian's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrueHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrueHistory">True History</a></em> is a very old example of this. Lucian was annoyed at how many contemporary historians would report just about anything as fact, so he wrote a "true" story that was as ludicrous as he could imagine. The clue to it not being what it says it is is the fact that it is the earliest known story about a trip to the moon. It ends with a promise that the protagonist's further adventures will be described <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">in a sequel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise">which is also a lie</a>.
</li><li> James Frey's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces">A Million Little Pieces<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> caused no small headache for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow">Oprah Winfrey</a> after she plugged the book for Oprah's Book Club. First she denied the idea that parts of the book were false, then she tried to claim that essential truth was more important than factual truth (which honked off the general public), before she finally rescinded her recommendation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonyouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonyouSuckSpeech">verbally castigated the author on her show</a>. In the end it turned out to be more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a> than anything, as Frey made massive embellishments in order to get the book published, but the story does have truth to it if widely stretched. Despite this, Frey has gone on to some success, including as one half of the pseudonym Pittacus Lore in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmNumberFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmNumberFour">I Am Number Four</a></em> series, which has led at least one critic to comment that at least it's known for a fact he can write fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMay">Karl May</a> is best known for his stories about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorStandIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorStandIn">"his"</a> travels through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou">the American West</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle">the Middle East</a> long before he actually visited the U.S. and the Orient in person. Today that's no longer a major issue, but some of his contemporaries didn't take it well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves">House of Leaves</a></em> plays with this, with the framing manuscript claiming to be a critical analysis of a documentary that the editor of the manuscript assures us doesn't really exist, about a photojournalist who documents footage of his very strange house.
</li><li> A popular pamphlet in the 19th century supposedly details the horrific abuse of a woman by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormons</a>, who supposedly imprisoned her in the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City and used her as a sex slave. Several people bought it and used it for Mormon-bashing, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, who repeated the claims in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInScarlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInScarlet">first Sherlock Holmes novel</a> and defended them for years afterwards. The story's falsehood is evidenced by its ending, when the woman escapes by jumping out of a window into the Great Salt Lake and swimming to safety — the temple is in the center of the city, and the lake is more than 30 kilometers away.
</li><li> The book <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Monk">The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> does the same thing for the Catholic church, suffering from extreme artistic license that clearly indicated it was fiction. Some claim that Maria Monk was actually a brain-damaged woman who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">tricked by her publishers or ghostwriters, who profited from her "experience" and left her destitute.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DangerousLiaisons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DangerousLiaisons">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</a></em> has two prefaces, both written by the author. The author's preface is called the "Editor's" and claims all the letters in the book are true; he's just edited out boring bits. The publisher's preface warns that it's all false, but in a deliberately ridiculous way — the "publisher" claims the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">obviously can't be true</a> because nobody in <em>this</em> country, in <em>this</em> oh-so-enlightened era, would <em>ever</em> behave as these characters do. (So the real message is that yes, the story itself is fiction, but it's a satire on how people really do act.)
</li><li> <em>The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a> claims to be a true story, only with a few names changed. Given that the title character exercises clairvoyant powers, it's reasonable to assume that he did not exist by <em>any</em> name.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://swallowingthecamel.me/2006/11/22/faux-bro-the-not-so-true-story-of-j-t-leroy-2/">Jeremiah Terminator Leroy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <em>a.k.a.</em> J.T. Leroy, was supposedly a young transgender prostitute who wrote several supposedly autobiographical novels about gender-dysphoric sex workers in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>. Only problem was that "Leroy" was the pen name of <a class="urllink" href="http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2006/01/my_name_is_susi.html">Laura Albert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a middle-aged woman who went as far as to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/09/books/09book.html?pagewanted=1">hire her sister-in-law, Savannah Knoop<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to make public appearances dressed up in drag in order to portray Leroy (try not to think about that one too hard). Knoop, for her part, got <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">Lost in Character</a>, playing "Leroy" for a good five years and even having a sexual affair with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AsiaArgento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AsiaArgento">Asia Argento</a> (claiming she had had a sex change operation by then, but it wasn't anyone's business so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCrossdressing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCrossdressing">she still dressed like a man in public</a> — try not to think about <em>that</em> one too hard). Once the con was revealed, Albert defended herself by saying she needed a "real" Leroy to be her avatar and allow her to write the best work possible. But audiences still thought the story was really good, even if it wasn't really true, which led to the film adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHeartIsDeceitfulAboveAllThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHeartIsDeceitfulAboveAllThings">The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wits');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3wits" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wits');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Albert, however, was actually convicted of fraud for signing away the film rights herself with "Leroy's" signature.</span>. Knoop, for her part, wrote <a class="urllink" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girl-Boy-How-Became-LeRoy/dp/1583228519">an autobiography<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about her time as Leroy which is also being adapted to a film starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart">Kristen Stewart</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Godby_Johnson">Anthony Godby Johnson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s <em><a class="urllink" href="http://swallowingthecamel.me/2006/08/03/anthony-godby-johnson-the-invisible-boy-2/">A Rock and a Hard Place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is the memoir of a young boy whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> molested him and sold him to their friends for sexual purposes, until he contracted AIDS. Eventually, he ran away and was adopted by a social worker named Vicki Johnson. However, none of it actually happened. Authorities and reporters who wanted to talk to the "kid" (including Keith Olbermann, who was one of his biggest early supporters) noticed that Vicki Johnson was the only one who had ever seen him. They also caught Johnson pretending to be the kid while talking on the phone. Their suspicions already raised, they turned to the book cover's supposed photo of the author as a little boy, and discovered that he grew up to be a New Jersey traffic engineer, and that the photo was taken by his teacher Joanna Victoria Fraginals — alias Vicki Johnson. Oprah fell for this one, too. And to add insult to injury, <em>A Rock and a Hard Place</em> is not very well-written, particularly once you realize that its author wasn't an eleven-year-old. The case was so polemic that it inspired <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArmisteadMaupin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArmisteadMaupin">Armistead Maupin</a>, one of many authors taken in by the hoax, to write <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightListener" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightListener">The Night Listener</a></em> based on the experience, and an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">ripped it from the headlines</a> (the victim is revealed to have discovered a similar hoax and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out to have been murdered by the <em>publisher</em>, who couldn't believe it <em>wasn't</em> true</span>).
</li><li> The book <em>The Third Eye</em> by "Lobsang Rampa" is...difficult to classify. It allegedly tells the experiences of a Tibetan lama, but subsequent inquiries eventually revealed that it was written by a plumber from Devon called Cyril Hoskin who had never been to Tibet in his life. When challenged about this, Hoskin subsequently insisted that "Rampa" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyAndHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyAndHost">a walk-in spirit</a> that had taken over his body. (As shown by the "Talk" page on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Hoskin">his Wikipedia article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, some people genuinely believe this, or at least think he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">Willing Channeler</a>.) What prevents this from being a straight example is that to all appearances, Hoskin appears to have genuinely and sincerely believed it himself; whether he was genuinely hosting somebody, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">Lost in Character</a> or out-and-out schizophrenic is a mystery for the ages.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> books are all supposedly based on rediscovered memoirs written by the title character. This device (coupled with the impressive amount of research <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a> put into every volume) led more than one critic to believe they were the real deal. The first book in particular fooled American reviewers, who were totally unfamiliar with Fraser and the Victorian novel <em>Flashman</em> was based on (<em>Tom Brown's School Days</em>).
</li><li> The "Satanic Panic" of the 1980s was largely created on the basis of several written accounts of Satanic ritual abuse, pretty much all of which later turned out to be fabricated:
<ul><li> The book <em>Michelle Remembers</em> is perhaps the most (in)famous alleged written account of Satanic ritual abuse. It has now been widely discredited, mostly by many healthy doses of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> — for example, a supposedly non-religious 5-year-old having the presence of mind to rebuke Satanists with a cross; an 81-day ritual that summons the Devil himself during which none of the Satanists apparently need to eat, use the bathroom, or show up at work;<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note467ro');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note467ro" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note467ro');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When school records revealed that Michelle herself never missed a day of school during the supposed ritual, the authors dismissed this as another part of the Satanic conspiracy</span> and a fatal car wreck that strangely didn't turn up in a newspaper that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalAngle">regularly reported less serious wrecks</a>. One of the worst parts is that Michelle (who later divorced her husband to marry the psychologist to whom she was relating all of this) blames her involvement in the abuse on her mother, who died of cancer when Michelle was 14. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=cabc&amp;c=whs&amp;id=4349">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> article gives a detailed analysis of the book.

The evangelical magazine <em>Cornerstone</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140813230052/http://holysmoke.org/sdhok/side.htm">exposed it as a hoax<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when not only it pointed out that the dates and events she gave didn't line up with hospital and school records, but it also mentioned several incidents of Willson's past in which she falsely accused her family (especially her mother) of abusing her. Willson later reappeared <a class="urllink" href="http://swallowingthecamel.me/2011/07/20/the-prodigal-witch-ix-lauren-stratford-part-iii/">as "Laura Grabowski"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, claiming to be a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor">Dr. Josef Mengele</a>; this, too, was exposed as a fraud when a Jewish group investigated her claims.

</li><li> In 1986, the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackChick">Jack Chick</a> published a bizarre book named <em><a class="urllink" href="http://swallowingthecamel.me/2011/06/26/the-prodigal-witch-viii-elaine/">He Came to Set the Captives Free<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which supposedly depicted how Dr. Rebecca Brown released a woman named Elaine from a huge Satanic cult that had forced her to marry Satan himself, among other things. It turned out "Dr. Brown" was an ex-physician named Ruth Bailey who lost her license for abusing her patients (<em>i.e.</em>, she tried to overdose them on painkillers), and that "Elaine" (whose real name was Edna) was a roommate and former patient whom she also treated like crap.
</li><li> In 2012, retired unlicensed social worker Judy Byington tried to resurrect the Satanic Panic with her book <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em>, allegedly the biography of a former prostitute, drug user, and mental patient. It involves divine intervention, prophecy, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">Jewish Nazi CIA</a> mind controller, and a hardened ex-con yelling, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">kiss my</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDarnItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDarnItToHeck">lickety-split!</a>"

It was popular enough for many high schools to put it on their reading lists. Then it was discovered that the author "Forrest Carter" was really <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_Earl_Carter">Asa Earl Carter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Ku Klux Klan member and author of George Wallace's famous "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever" line. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow">Oprah</a> had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">pull this book from her reading lists too</a>, but it took her a while — she recommended it in 1994 only to pull it from her website <em>in 2007</em>.
</li><li> Horace Walpole originally passed off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCastleOfOtranto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCastleOfOtranto">The Castle of Otranto</a></em> as an antique manuscript penned by an Italian clergyman. At the time he wrote it, supernatural tales were regarded as embarrassing products of ignorance, not entertainment, and Walpole probably feared for his credibility if his name were attached to literature's first Gothic novel.
</li><li> A children's book called <em>The Pushcart War</em> claimed it was based on a true story. While certain events are implausible (like attacking trucks with pea-shooters), it's theoretically <em>possible</em>... until you realize that the copyright date is before the time that the events in the book supposedly take place. This is deliberate, as the book was presented as a history written long after the events described therein. Interestingly, its publishers update the "historical" time frame with each new edition. It was originally published in 1964 describing events in 1975. Later releases said 1986 and 1998. The most recent version says 2029.
</li><li> Lorenzo Carcaterra's <em>Sleepers</em> (which was also made into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleepers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleepers">a film</a>) purported to be a nonfiction account of how he and three of his friends were sent to reform school for a year, where they were viciously abused by the guards. A decade later, two of the friends killed one of the guards, but they were acquitted of murder because they were prosecuted by the third friend, who intentionally lost the case with the help of a false alibi provided by a priest. However, there's no evidence the story happened; Carcaterra conveniently claims everything was covered up (like his school records, which show that he was never sent to reform school or absent for any appreciable length of time) or deliberately obscured (responding to claims that there was no case in Manhattan whose details correspond to Carcaterra's by claiming it didn't take place in Manhattan).
</li><li> Mormon youth counselor Beatrice Sparks made a habit of writing books that purport to be real diaries of teenagers who deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Problems</a>, like AIDS (<em>It Happened to Nancy</em>) or teen pregnancy (<em>Annie's Baby</em>). They were all invented from whole cloth, but not before they were taken as true by terrified parents trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">save their children from the world around them</a>. Among her most famous:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoAskAlice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoAskAlice">Go Ask Alice</a></em>, which addresses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">the evils of drugs</a>, offers the compelling tale of a young suburban girl who is sucked into the world of drugs and eventually ends up dead. It's quoted so often that it had to be <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/askalice.asp">debunked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Jay's Journal</em>, a botched attempt at this that got Sparks sued by the real Jay's family. Jay was a real boy named <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040723080129/http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2004/feat_2004-06-03.cfm">Alden Barrett<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who suffered from depression and committed suicide in 1971. His parents, themselves devout Mormons who believed <em>Go Ask Alice</em> was real, asked Sparks to publish Alden's diary. Only a fragment of the book actually comes from Alden's diary; the rest was a fabricated story about how he was lured into Satanism and ultimately killed himself for that reason. This led her readers (not taking kindly to Satanism) to desecrate his grave, and his family was torn apart over whether he really did fall into Satanism. Jay's brother left Mormonism entirely and wrote <em>A Place in the Sun</em> about the whole ordeal (later adapted into <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ericdsnider.com/theater/a-place-in-the-sun/">a rock opera<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).

He denied murdering them and claimed they were killed in a war with an underground race called "tektons". The suspect then blocked off the passage connecting the tektons' underground world to ours, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavingTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavingTheWorld">Saving the World</a>, and returned to civilization alone.

Another SAS veteran flew out to Iraq in 1993, retraced as much of the squad's route and interviewed as many witnesses as he could find, and discovered that both of them were equally guilty of inflating their stories. If they were exaggerating for the sake of a good story this would be bad enough, but they were apparently less than truthful during their debriefing sessions as well. Unfortunately, by the time this became generally known, there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">half a dozen other "true accounts"</a> of the SAS in the Gulf War that showed equal regard for fact-checking. Peter Radcliffe, then-Regimental Sergeant Major of the SAS and the only Gulf War veteran of the Regiment to publish his memoirs without a pseudonym, devotes an entire chapter to the whole wretched business.

The events in the books were claimed to be completely true, with only names and places changed to protect those involved, and Marklund spent years using the books as proof in political debates. In 2008, Monica Antonsson wrote a book proving that the books about "Mia" are almost completely fictional. After trying to claim that Antonsson was lying, Marklund changed her tune and claimed the books were never meant to be taken as fact and were clearly fiction all along.
</li><li> Jordanian-American author Norma Khouri's book <em>Forbidden Love</em> is supposedly a memoir detailing her life in Jordan and her friendship with a Muslim woman named Dalia, who was murdered by her family in an honour killing for meeting a Christian man in secret. Even before publication, Khouri was confronted by Jordanian feminist and women's rights activist Amal al-Sabbagh, who noted that Khouri had completely misrepresented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Jordan's legal system</a> and also got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography">many important locations wrong</a> in her zeal to portray Jordan as inhabited entirely by primitive desert-dwellers. Khouri dismissed this criticism (or more accurately, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/23/1090464851887.html">threw a hissy-fit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), claiming that al-Sabbagh was just trying to protect Jordan's image (which made no sense, given that she was herself a women's rights activist who opposed honour killings). Then, after publication, an Australian literary critic did some digging and found that Khouri wasn't even in Jordan at all during the book's timeframe; instead, she was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/26/1090693899061.html">in America with her husband<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, before they left the U.S. after their involvement in several other frauds. At this, the publisher hastily recalled the book. Khouri admitted to taking some liberties with the original story but still insists that the story is true, despite all evidence to the contrary.

</li><li> The works of Carlos Castaneda, specifically his first three books about his time with ostensible Yaqui shaman Don Juan, were quite popular in anthropology circles in the 1970s. After detailed examination of the timelines and locations described by Castaneda, critics pointed out that that they could not have have possibly happened as described. While the books do show some knowledge of native Southwestern tribes, at least once description of a peyote ceremony was determined to be lifted from an anthropology textbook available at the school where Castaneda studied. While he never fully admitted to the books being fictional, he acknowledged "taking liberties" with the times and locations. To date, no independent verification of Don Juan's identity, or some of the ceremonies Castaneda described, has been found. Meanwhile Castaneda made a fortune off the books and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.salon.com/2007/04/12/castaneda/">started a cult<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> consisting primarily of women students, some of whom killed themselves after his death hoping to rejoin him.

This particular deal is even more serious because Holocaust deniers and anti-semites have clung to books like these to claim that <em>every</em> Holocaust memoir is a fake — including those proven to be real like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiaryOfAnneFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiaryOfAnneFrank">The Diary of Anne Frank</a></em>, Olga Lengel's <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Chimneys">Five Chimneys<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikl%C3%B3s_Nyiszli">Dr. Miklos Nyiszli's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account</em>, or Martin Grays <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Those_I_Loved">For Those I Loved<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.

Mr. Rosenblat really <em>is</em> a Holocaust survivor and really was imprisoned in the Schlieben camp as a child and teenager, but as the historians Kenneth Waltzer and Deborah Lipstadt found out, the parts about his future wife Roma secretly meeting him and sneaking him food through the Schlieben fence were pure fiction, and he didn't start "telling" them until several years after their marriage. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Oprah was fooled by this one, too.</a>)
</li><li> Jerzy Kosinski's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Painted_Bird">The Painted Bird<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was a fiction book that was supposedly based on the author's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> war experiences in German-occupied Poland, which turned out to be false. Poles often accuse the author of being a Holocaust profiteer, as some parts <em>heavily</em> resembled Holocaust pornography; for this reason, the book was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">banned in Poland</a> for more than 20 years. Most egregiously, the couple who took care of him as a boy alongside other Jewish children that they protected was depicted as abusers and rapists; they were naturally rather <em>pissed</em> when they found out.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://swallowingthecamel.me/2008/03/02/460/">Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was written by Misha Defonseca. She said when she was four years old, her Jewish parents were sent to a concentration camp during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, and after she got tired of being abused by her caretakers, she crossed all of Europe to try finding them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">alone with wolves during the travel</a>. A movie was made in 2007 based on the novel. Then, "Misha" confessed after that her name was Monique de Wael, she wasn't born a Jew, her parents were arrested because they were members of the Belgian Resistance, and she was simply sent to her grandfather.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note79qjl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note79qjl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note79qjl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's surprising that it even had to go this far. Before the movie, a small conference of Polish Holocaust survivors exposed the book as a lie, just because Jews in Poland didn't have to wear yellow stars on chest, but blue ones on the arm.</span> Monique said that she wrote the story because of her passion for wolves and as a way to "cope" with her harsh life during these years. (And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Oprah also recommended it.</a>)
</li><li> Australian writer Helen Darville won 1995's <em>Australian/Vogel Literary Award</em> and <em>Miles Franklin Award</em> for a novel named <em>The Hand That Signed the Paper</em>, written under the pen name "Helen Demidenko". It supposedly described her anti-semitic Ukranian family's experiences through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8up86');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8up86" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8up86');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(<em>i.e.</em>, a teenage male character is involucrated in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_Yar">massacres at Babi Yar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and later is in a Waffen SS group, his older brother becomes a guard in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_death_camp">Treblinka death camp<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, their sister is the lover of a German officer, and the older brother's girlfriend helps out a Treblinka prisoner in the 1943 camp revolt)</span>, but <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Darville#The_Hand_That_Signed_the_Paper:_novel_and_controversy">it turned out to be a complete fabrication<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and opened the floodgates for quite the discussion on literary hoaxes in Australia. It was later re-issued under Darville's actual name.
</li><li> The 1995 Holocaust memoir <em>Fragments</em> was supposedly written by Latvian-Jewish musician and luthier <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binjamin_Wilkomirski">Binjamin Wilkomirski<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, depicting the author's "childhood time" in Auschwitz-Birkenau through a rather unusual narrative, allegedly akin to a young child's view. In 1997, the Swiss journalist Daniel Ganzifried (son of a Holocaust survivor) argued that Wilkomirski was actually Bruno Grosjean-Dossekker, a Swiss gentile born from a single mother and who had been adopted by a rich local family as a little boy. Wilkomirski claimed that he was a Latvian-Jewish child adopted by a gentile family who re-named him Bruno after their dead son. However, further investigation by historian Stefan Maechler confirmed Ganzifried's claims. One of the strongest pieces of evidence against the author was how he "recognized" a fellow Auschwitz survivor, the aforementioned "Laura Grabowski".
</li><li> In 2004 the University of Western Australia Press published <em>Stolen Soul</em>, the Holocaust memoir of a 69-year-old mining camp cook named Bernard Holstein. Holstein told heart-rending stories of being experimented upon by Nazi scientists in Auschwitz, living with wolves, joining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, and travelling to Australia as an orphan. Holstein lacked a German accent, but his arm bore a number tattoo. His publisher, Judy Shorrock, had no doubts about his story until she received a phone call from Bernards brother. Bernard was really Bernard Brougham, son of a Catholic family from New South Wales; he had never been to Europe, and went as far as getting a fake number tattoo to make his tale more believable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://swallowingthecamel.me/2008/03/04/464/">Love and Consequences<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/books/04fake.html?ref=books&amp;_r=0">"Margaret B.

It was actually written by Margaret "Peggy" Seltzer, an upper middle-class white woman. She claimed that while she <em>did</em> lie about her identity, she based the book on real testimonies that she collected through her work in the suburbs.
</li><li> Margaret Landon's <em>Anna and the King of Siam</em> was based of the works of Anna Leonowens, who was a real person and <em>did</em> teach English to the royal children of Siam. Her book <em>The English Governess at the Siamese Court</em> seems to be a fairly accurate account of her experiences, but the sequel <em>The Romance of the Harem</em> was apparently based on rumor, gossip, and tales handed down from previous generations. Anna also lied about her background, reinventing herself as a Welsh gentlewoman and widow of an English officer rather than the Anglo-Indian daughter of a British soldier and widow of a civilian clerk that she really was.
</li><li> Anne Carson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AutobiographyOfRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AutobiographyOfRed">Autobiography of Red</a></em> combines this with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a>: it includes a supposed rewrite of Stesichoros' <em>Geryoneis</em> that is almost entirely Carson's original work, but is prefaced by an essay that seems designed to mislead the reader into thinking it's simply a translation. Since it's full of pretty obvious anachronisms — hot plates, weekends, glass-bottomed boats — a certain amount of playfulness must be in effect.
</li><li> The <em>Iolo Manuscripts</em> are a series of ancient manuscripts on Welsh Bardic and Druidic theology collected in the 18th century by Iolo Morganwg, edited by Taliesin Williams, and published in 1848. Or so it was claimed: in fact "Iolo Morganwg", real name Edward Williams, faked them all. Nonetheless, the "Iolo" collection was taken as authentic and used as source material by generations of scholars before it was debunked.

Her former trainer Killer Kowalski immediately slammed it as inaccurate, calling her "the biggest liar". X-Pac had similar sentiments. April Hunter likewise had good things to say about Chyna, but called some of her descriptions in the book impossible to match with the facts.

<ul><li> Kids' show <em>Wacaday</em> had something very similar to this with its fictionalized historical fact segments, as they'd always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">remind you at the end</a> that <em>"We know it's true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">because we made it up ourselves!</a>"</em>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> inverts this with a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode, stating that the events and characters of the series are entirely false. While nothing like any of the episodes has ever happened in real life, Lightman is based off of a real-life person, Dr. Paul Ekman. The disclaimer may be to avoid legal wrangling, given the show's tendencies. For example, Lightman may declare that he knows another character is lying by the way that person touches his hand to his lips — then, as the show goes to commercial, we are shown news photos of real-life people (mostly politicians) performing the same gesture.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision">Reality Television</a> can be prone to this. While all of Reality TV is Based On a Great Big Lie to some extent — the "characters" are presented with carefully crafted situations, and many reality show participants mostly understand what kind of "role" they are supposed to play for the cameras — some shows go further than others in fabricating reality.

Most of the house-hunting imitators that have sprung up in the wake of <em>House Hunters</em> are similarly Based On a Great Big Lie. You can see for yourself: note how rarely a realtor's "For Sale" sign will be seen in front of a property that is supposedly for sale. (A woman who appeared on <em>House Hunters International</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/house-hunters-true-story-of-being-on-the-show.html">twice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> wrote about how the show is totally faked.)

In fact, they had all been living in the secular world for years, one for over a decade. Two of the cast members who were shown going on their "first date" on the show had really been involved for years and had a child together before the show started recording.

In other words they admit that what they're actually showing is amateur improv.

</li><li> Used in-universe in season five <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>: Scott Templeton, junior journalist at the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>, is prone to embellishing his claims just enough to avoid detection, partly to avoid layoffs and partly to earn a better job at a bigger paper. Only his editor really suspects him, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">nobody believes him</a>. Then Scott goes big and pretends he has been contacted by a serial killer who has been targeting homeless men in the city, making him nationally famous and the darling of upper management. The twist, however, is that the killer <em>himself</em> doesn't exist, and <em>even Scott doesn't know that</em> — he was made up by rogue homicide detective Jimmy McNulty, who's trying to fabricate a lurid story to secure funding for the chronically broke police department. McNulty, pleasantly surprised by this turn of events, happily calls Scott pretending to be the killer and plants more information (seriously freaking him out in the process), knowing Scott can't call him on it because his earlier lie would be exposed as well. In the end, Scott angles for a Pulitzer prize, and Gus airs his suspicions to the paper's management, which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">loses him his job</span>.
</li><li> The 2014-2017 TV remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo">Fargo</a></em>, like the film it was based on, also claimed to be based on true stories, despite the four stories being set in the same region of the country in different decades, with the first season having such a similar-but-markedly-different plot that it and the movie they can't <em>both</em> have happened without someone mentioning it. The series follows the Coens' admission that the events of the film were fictional, so the boilerplate is meant to be taken with a grain of salt.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CasoCerrado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CasoCerrado">Caso Cerrado</a></em> cases are unrealistic. One episode involves a woman whose daughter caught a STD from a Rainbow Party. "Rainbow Parties" are an urban legend.

Nowhere is this more evident than in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>, which was commissioned by King James I of England, who was also King James VI of Scotland and the descendant of the people who overthrow Macbeth in the play.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9nazi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9nazi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9nazi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not Malcolm, but rather Banquo's son Fleance (whose descendants the witches prophesy will be kings); in hindsight, it makes Fleance's relatively minor role in the play quite interesting.</span> As such, the play glosses over Macbeth's reign as King of the Scots, which in real life lasted 17 years — long enough for him to go to Rome and be personally blessed by the Pope. Macbeth in real life didn't kill Duncan in his sleep to take his crown, but rather defeated him in battle. Nor was Macbeth directly succeeded by Duncan's son Malcolm (who was a child, not a young adult, at the time when Duncan was killed), but rather by his own stepson Lulach (who doesn't even appear in the play), who had a brief and apparently rather dismal reign as King before Malcolm had him assassinated (and only <em>then</em> became King Malcolm III). Malcolm, for his part, apparently assassinated Macbeth in real life; in the play, Macbeth is killed by Macduff, who doesn't appear to correspond to any real person. In any event, it's not as if Shakespeare's audience really cared about historical accuracy, and even the contemporary history books were notoriously inaccurate.
</li><li> Ruggero Leoncavallo's opera <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a></em> is probably based on a lie. Leoncavallo said it was based on a court case that his father, who was a judge, presided over, and further claimed that he had the documentation to prove it. However, no such document, or indeed any corroborating evidence, has ever been found. It is now generally believed that Leoncavallo played the "true story" card to evade the charge of plagiarism.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pippin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pippin">Pippin</a></em> begins with the Leading Player imploring the audience to "cast all previous misconceptions aside" of Pippin's life, because "what you are about to see is the <em>true</em> life story of Pippin." Even discounting the blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a> unrealism, there are very few things in the show that loosely correspond to anything that happened in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Carolingian Empire.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TengaiMakyou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TengaiMakyou">Tengai Makyou</a></em> is purportedly based on a book about Japan named <em>Far East of Eden</em>, by a European author named P. H. Chada. He and his writings never existed, although they <em>are</em> genuinely inspired by the largely- to entirely-fictitious accounts of life in Japan that used to be popular in the West. This one is <em>very</em> tongue-in-cheek and not at all intended to be taken seriously, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrameI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrameI">Fatal Frame</a></em> was localized with <em>Based on a true story</em> as a tagline on the cover. The creators themselves have said that any mansion that urban legends believe to be haunted in Japan were not based on or inspired Himuro Mansion.
</li><li> At the start, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmedAndDangerous">Armed and Dangerous</a></em> says that it was based on a true story. Considering that this game includes a tea-drinking robot, miniature black holes, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandShark">land shark</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamuFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamuFu">gun</a> (among many other things), this was probably not supposed to be taken seriously.
</li><li> <em>Sea of Lies: Mutiny of the Heart</em> claims to be "based on true historical events" during the intro, but doesn't mention where or when these supposed events allegedly happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LakeviewCabinCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LakeviewCabinCollection">Lakeview Cabin Collection</a></em> gives one at the beginning of <em>Part IV</em>, the entire episode being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em>.

Marcus Parks is particularly incensed, as he feels the movie portrays Kuklinski as a <em>far</em> more sympathetic figure than the man was in real life. Marcus compares it to making a movie about John Wayne Gacy and focusing exclusively on his being a clown.

SpongeBob and Patrick quickly come to believe that their pirate quest is a scam (and that Mr. Krabs has gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a>), finding out the treasure map is just a game board they used earlier in the episode. Chance kicks in as they do find the treasure according to the game board, to which SpongeBob remarks "it really <em>is</em> based on a true treasure map!" Then the Flying Dutchman comes in to take his treasure back, but he's willing to share with SpongeBob and Patrick. So he gives hem a piece of the game board (much to Mr. Krabs' dismay), telling them "it's based on a <em>real</em> treasure chest!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery">Tex Avery</a> was fond of this trope. <em>Drag-Along Droopy</em> began with the disclaimer: "This is an absolutely authentic account of the grazing land battles of the sheep and cattle wars of the early West. We know this story to be true. It was told to us by — <em>A TEXAN</em>!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> episode "Son of Stimpy" (<em>a.k.a.</em> "Stimpy's First Fart") began with a voiceover declaring that "this is a true story that we made up".
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a></em> cartoon (a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em>) begins with, "The story you are about to see is a big fat lie. No names have been changed to protect anyone."

Aang diffuses the conflict by revealing that the whole event was a misunderstanding of a dispute their ancestors had while playing a silly ball game. But by the end of the episode, Aang reveals to his friends he made the whole thing up to stop the tribes from fighting.
