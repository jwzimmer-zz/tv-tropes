<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, people do extreme things to take their comrades off the field with them. Ling carries his wounded servant Lan Fan out of a battle and has a fight while carrying her - allowing a pretty heinous villain to mock him relentlessly. Roy cauterizes Havoc's wounds (his own as well) to help Havoc get safely out of the battle and to enable himself to go and rescue Al and Hawkeye.
<ul><li> This is lampshaded later on when Roy tells two of his men to leave him behind if he gets hurt. They instantly agree. Surprised by their response, tells them that the <em>correct</em> answer is for them to reply "Never! I'd follow you to the depths of hell!" One of the men responds, "Screw that. I've got a family!" While the other says it's stupid to "commit double suicide like that." Roy answers with a knowing smile.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GodEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GodEater">God Eater</a></em>: In episode 1, Lenka refuses to leave behind the guy who tells him to get away so he can live.
</li><li> Averted like <em>hell</em> in every staircase sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> — if two or more of Athena's Saints arrive at the battleground with a new opponent, one of them will <em>insist</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRestShallPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRestShallPass">staying behind to fight, just so the other can press onwards</a> to save the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">goddess</a>. And then, if the first Saint's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Cosmo</a> fades, the other(s) will stop, look back and think about how their friend has just possibly died, and then continue their climb instead of going back to help. Then again, the Saints' utmost priority is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">protect Athena</a>, even at the cost of their own lives, so they earnestly believe that continuing the mission is far more important — even if they have to leave <em>everybody</em> behind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>, so much - Kurogane <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>cuts off his own arm</em> to keep Fai from being left behind in the closing world of Celes</span>.
</li><li> This gets averted in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> movie, <em>Big Trouble in Nekonron</em>, when Ranma's party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">fragments a little bit more</a> in every miniboss encounter, as members will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRestShallPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRestShallPass">stay behind to hold off their own tailor-made opponents</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> manga, Green and Sabrina are handcuffed together and fighting Lorelei. Green is knocked out and Sabrina is hanging on the edge of a cliff. Lorelei suggests that Sabrina save herself by cutting off Green's cuffed hand and letting her drop. Sabrina responds that, even though she and Green were once enemies, they are allies now and that she never abandons an ally.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> this is exemplified by the father of Hatake Kakashi, Hatake Sakumo. While on a critical mission for Konoha during the Third Ninja War, Sakumo given the choice of rescuing his teammates or completing the mission, Sakumo chose to save his team. Unfortunately, the failure of the mission was not well received. While Sakumo prior was respected on the same level or even above the Sannin, the mission's failure caused such catastrophic losses, that he became reviled afterwards. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The stress was so extreme that he committed suicide in front of Kakashi.</span> Kakashi from this experience became an ultra-strict rule follower and general jerkass who would also put the mission first. Later Uchiha Obito would naturally adopt this attitude and pass it on to Kakashi. After Obito's death, Kakashi would adopt this to the extreme adopting the directive that he wouldn't let anyone on his team die.
<ul><li> Naruto of course has taken this to the extreme doing everything in his power in the second part of the story to bring back Sasuke and save him from himself and his revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>. In two episodes, Menchi escapes and makes new friends. Every single friend she meets eventually tells her to go on without them and makes a heroic sacrifice to save Menchi. The final time this happens, the villain says, "What an out-of-character way to die." (Although it turns out that this <em>one</em> character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>.)
</li><li> Lampshaded and played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VanDread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VanDread">Van Dread</a></em>. Dita tries pulling one of these when Gascogne gets stuck. Gascogne is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>.
<div class="indent">Gascogne: "This isn't a third rate soap opera! You go and you come back with help and get me!"
</div></li><li> An interesting variation is done in the Alabasta arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: After Luffy defeated Crocodile, he carried both the king of Alabasta and antagonist Miss All-Sunday (AKA: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nico Robin</span>) out of the crumbling room they were in. The latter was wishing for death, but Luffy didn't listen and saved her anyway. She eventually paid him back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">by joining his crew</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em>, Hot Shot and Wheeljack were in a platoon on Cybertron during a battle with the Decepticons when the two, isolated from the others, were engulfed in an inferno, and Wheeljack was trapped under debris. Hot Shot left him, vowing to get help, but when he reached the other Autobots, his commander forbade him to go back for Wheeljack, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">he didn't want to lose more troops</a>. Hot Shot disobeyed him and tried to go back anyway, but by then the flames were too intense and unable to reach Wheeljack, Hot Shot believed his friend had perished. He would discover years later on Earth that he was wrong - that Wheeljack had survived - but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold">it wouldn't be a happy reunion</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UchiNoMusumeNiTeODasuNa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UchiNoMusumeNiTeODasuNa">Uchi no Musume ni Te o Dasu na!</a></em>: Seen in chapter 5, when Point Blank ambushes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies">Risa, Kisara, and Jun</a> by shooting down their patrol chopper. Then guns them down as they're trying to get each other to safety. Clara tries to come to their rescue, creating a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> but ends up being gunned down with them. Point Blank continues to fire on her even after she falls unconscious. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Athena's intervention</a> to finally make him stop</span>. All four are later seen in the infirmary.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>, Shun Kurosaki grew up in a war zone where many of his people were captured by the enemy. He gives a big speech that he will never abandon his comrades and will do everything in his power to save them. This extends to his dueling; he has cards that can recover his monsters if his opponent gains control of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsters">Yu-Gi-Oh!: Capsule Monsters</a></em>, when his friends tell him to abandon them for the sake of winning over Alexander the Great, Yugi violently refuses and is adamant to stand by them, even if it means losing.
<ul><li> When the gang return from the Capsule Monster world, Alexander's good half hitches a ride with Solomon and attempts to quell his evil side.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2015 anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a></em>, Arslan refused to leave Elam behind, when Elam's horse was shot and Elam was surrounded by Lusitanian soldiers. The fact that Arslan risked his life to save Elam, who was a servant and not an important subordinate, cemented Gieve's respect for him.

Though some of his squadmates give him a hard time for it, the vets acknowledge it as necessary, even effective.
<ul><li> In fact, the Lieutenant of the main's group points out that their standard ammunition is designed to cripple, not kill, saying that "if you maim an enemy on the field it takes four of his friends to haul him back from the battle and even more of his friends to patch him up and care for him.

Nunzio tries to avert disaster by explaining that what he MEANT was that wounding an opponent takes three men out of the action since two have to carry the wounded one.

This is more because he was losing dozens of men for each recovered body and regarded his losses as "insignificant". When it comes to the normal wounded, it's understood that they come first — in one episode the 4077 has to bug out and head south in the face of incoming Chinese forces, but Hawkeye, Margaret, and Radar stay behind because they have a patient that can't be moved and they refuse to leave him behind.

A landing to capture a strategic airstrip goes south because the Chigs suckered the UN high command, but the Navy realizes that in order to pull this off the Chigs withdrew forces from an even <em>more</em> strategic target, which is now open to attack. But there isn't time to retrieve the troops already on the ground so the ships are forced to abandon 25,000 troops, including our protagonists in the 58th, for two months until they've captured the new target and can return to retrieve them... by which point the 58th have nearly starved to death and only 2,000 survivors remain.

<ul><li> In the first season episode "The Torment of Tantalus", Daniel Jackson wants to attempt to rescue a man who went through the Stargate in 1945 and was lost when the Stargate shut down. He comes up with multiple reasons for why such a dangerous mission should be attempted, but General Hammond shuts him down very quickly, pointing out that the man was put in danger by the US Air Force, and he should be rescued as a matter of honor (which was Jackson's original argument, he just over-prepared).

</li><li> Averted in the finale of season one, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daniel was left behind on Apophis' soon-to-be-destroyed ship.</span> The implication, however, was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he</span> wasn't going to survive anyway (being severely injured), and the other characters probably wouldn't, either, if they didn't avert this trope. The irony was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if Daniel <em>hadn't</em> been left behind, he probably <em>would</em> have died anyway: he used the sarcophagus and the Gate to heal himself and get home (respectively). It's implied that they wouldn't have been able to save him on Earth.</span>
</li><li> Becomes an important point in "Cor-ai" when Teal'c is put on trial for killing a crippled old man while he was in the service of Apophis. Daniel finds out that the villagers escape through hidden tunnels when the Goa'uld come, but they won't leave anyone behind. Part of the way they exonerate Teal'c is by showing that he did what he did to save the multitude of the villagers so they could escape without being slowed down.
</li><li> Some of the villains start to get wise about this. One minor villain on Earth chews out his men for being stupid enough to capture Daniel Jackson since he knows that by doing so they've just mobilized the entire SGC against themselves when they really should have been trying to stay as unnoticed as possible.

<ul><li> In practice this is usually played straight with Jeremy and the "code" usually isn't brought up when Jeremy's car needs a serious problem repairs, probably because he tends to be much less capable of doing it.

The Tau and Eldar are about the only ones who ever try, and the Eldar consider recovering the waystones of the dead good enough consolation for being unable to save the bodies of the living (the fact that Eldar wear them to prevent their souls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">from being devoured</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror">evil Chaos God of lust</a> may also have something to it).
<ul><li> Similarly, although the Marines consider it the highest honour to die in battle, they'll fight hard to recover the two progenoid glands from the still-cooling bodies of their battle brothers, as they are necessary to convert new Space Marines. (The way the Chaos forces can use them lends a certain amount of urgency to this.)
<ul><li> The Grey Knights, however, will fight as hard as possible to recover their comrades' bodies, not just the glands, so they can lay them to rest on Titan.

<ul><li> On the Land Raider page in the codex, it is mentioned that an entire chapter once started a giant war to recover one weapon blown off one of their tanks.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a scenario in the Black Templars section of the GW website dealing with the recovery of the remains of their Emperor's Champion.
</li><li> Certain Imperial Guard regiments will also make it a point to try and recover their wounded, though they usually don't take unnecessary steps to rescue them if it will cost too many lives. Being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a>, the Guardsmen are generally both aware of this fact and expect it.
<ul><li> In the 5th Edition Imperial Guard Codex, one of the special characters, Sergeant Lukas Bastonne of the Cadian Shock Troops, earned the highest award a soldier in the Imperium can earn in their lifetime by refusing to leave one of his soldiers behind on a zombie-riddled planet. Of course he had to execute the man because he showed symptoms of the same plague that caused the zombies in the first place, so whether this is a backhanded subversion or not is debatable.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tyranids do this too, in a sense. When they gather up the biological material from a planet they've conquered, they make sure to get <strong>all</strong> of it, which includes every single 'Nid that got killed in the attack.
<ul><li> Actually they also collect the biomass from most of the survivors too. The greater part of their assault troops are creatures that have no digestive system: they are MEANT to die, should they survive the invasion, and they'll be reprocessed into biomass for later use.

After fighting Mary's brainwashed ex-husband, mooks can be heard getting closer; Stahn and co. have to run away, but Mary wants to stay with her semi-dead man.

During the last part of the prologue, Marth is told by his advisor that he has to sacrifice one of his soldiers as a decoy to allow him to escape. Marth insists that everyone sticks together, but if you decide not to send a unit to the southern fort, you'll soon be overrun by an army of Knights who are capable of killing any and all of your party members with one hit (two or three, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Jagen's</a> case). Leaving a unit behind is the only way you can proceed to the end of the chapter, as the second gate won't open unless you do. The exception is if you kill Gordin instead of talking to him - the commander of the enemy forces laughs at how he's tricked Marth into murdering a civilian (Gordin was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> and dressed in an enemy uniform) before ordering his men to open the second gate so he can kill Marth personally.

Typically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangit">one would jump onto the airship at the first opportunity</a>, but by waiting until the last possible second, Shadow will catch up and join the party. The game helpfully gives a countdown so the rest of the party knows when "the last possible second" is, but only if you actively choose to wait around the first time since the options then are "Jump!" and "Wait!". The second time, the options are "Jump to the airship!" and "Gotta wait for Shadow...".
</li><li> Strago also tries to get Relm to go on without him during the final escape from Kefka's Tower, but she will have none of it. Good thing too, because, later on, she wouldn't have reached the airship without his help.

</li><li> If a survivor is incapacitated outside the safe room at the end of a level, the other survivors will usually say that they can't leave anyone behind. Though on occasion Francis will say he's fine with leaving a teammate behind if everyone else is. Similarly, if Louis is down outside the safe room, Bill may joke "How well do you know Louis?" and then admitting he was just joking. There's an achievement that you can earn if you leave the safe room to rescue a downed survivor outside and the two of you make it back.

From a game-player point of view, it's encouraged because experienced troops are precious commodities and fallen troopers left behind will take all their special gear with them, but successfully evacing a near-dead soldier while being under heavy fire can sure make the player feel heroic. Troopers who <em>are</em> left behind (but not killed, only knocked unconscious) are listed as "Captured" though.

<ul><li> Famous and macabre example: when the Chinese army attacked UN forces in Korea in the brutal winter of 1950, they surrounded the elite and famous US 1st Marine Division. Faced with utter annihilation, the division's officers rallied their men by vowing to get everyone out, including the wounded and the dead. Their convoys coming down out of the mountains, depicted in newsreel footage and several movies, reveal how brutal the fighting was and how determined they were to achieve that symbolic goal: their trucks and jeeps are festooned with frozen corpses wrapped in blankets and body bags.
<ul><li> This ended up actually having a very fortunate outcome in terms of the war in general. At least two, probably three, Chinese Army Groups were tied up with the Marine Division and were unable to link up in time with their counterparts who were blazing through the U.S. and Korean armies (at least in comparison to the snail crawl that went on with the 1st).
</li></ul></li><li> World War 2 example: 442nd Infantry Regiment of the United States Army famously rescued the "Lost Battalion" at Biffontaine in southern France. Over a five-day period, from October 26 to October 30, 1944, the 442nd suffered the loss of nearly half of its roster. Over 800 casualties, including 121 dead. While rescuing 211 members of the 36th Infantry Division's 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry, which had been surrounded by German forces in the Vosges mountains since October 24. Making it even more striking, the 442nd volunteered for the assignment — and this was a battalion of Japanese-American soldiers, many of whom had been treated horribly by the military and the US government in general.
<ul><li> The 442nd were renowned for a truly absurd amount of bravery. They finished the war with more decorations per capita than any unit in American history. Among the awards was an astounding 21 Medals of Honor, one awarded posthumously in 1946 and 20 awarded over 50 years later in 2000.
<ul><li> They were also one of the rare regiments that went well over 100% casualty (more soldiers killed and injured than were on the original roster) over the course of the war.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Israeli military takes this to an extreme by trading important prisoners for its soldiers be they dead or alive. For example, captured soldier Gilad Shalit was eventually returned to Israel in exchange for over <em>a thousand</em> prisoners, almost three hundred of whom had been serving life sentences for terrorism offences.
</li><li> After the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, the rescue workers in the area of the building housing the US Marine Corps Recruiting Office happened to be either active duty or Reserve Marines. The bodies of Captain Randolph Guzman and Sergeant Benjamin Davis were recovered by them, and as they removed the bodies from the scene, everyone fell silent, because (in the words of one witness) "The Marines were bringing out their own." And every year, one Marine officer and one Marine NCO in dress blues leave a wreath at the site.
</li><li> The Spartans' last stand at Thermopylae concluded its last few moments with a handful of soldiers clustered round the body of their dead king, Leonidas, before an arrow storm finally finished them off.
</li><li> In the Battle of Mogadishu (made famous in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown">Black Hawk Down</a></em>), following this policy resulted in many casualties.
<ul><li> Many terrorist organizations are aware of this trope about the U.S and that is of the reasons why the U.S. are normally wary in sending ground troops into a foreign land unless there's no other choice.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1953 American attempt to summit K2, the second-highest mountain and arguably the most difficult in the world, was frustrated by weather and mountain sickness. The eight-man team attempted to carry one of their number off the mountain, a nearly impossible feat at that altitude. Then a near-disastrous accident left everybody shaken and/or injured. The team decided to camp to recover and consider their options leaving their injured companion, Art Gilkey, secured in his litter to the mountain face but when they came to fetch him he had been swept away, litter and all, by an avalanche he might well have deliberately called down upon himself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save his comrades.
</li><li> Hideaki Akaiwa was at work on March 11th, 2011 when the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami hit his city of Ishinomaki, Japan. His wife of twenty years was trapped in their home under the waves, and rescue workers could not get to her. Rather than just give in to fate, Hideaki somehow managed to get a SCUBA kit and dove into the raging waters of the tsunami to rescue her. Navigating through the waters and dodging numerous obstacles including cars, downed power lines, and <em>houses</em> getting swept away in the current, he managed to find his home and his wife. She was alive, and thanks to Hideaki was rescued. This alone is impressive, but when his mother was declared missing, he did it <em>again</em> and saved her. And for the duration of the disaster, he went out on his bicycle alone with a folding knife, a few bottles of water, his SCUBA gear, and gave help wherever he could. He was named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/BadassOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/BadassOfTheWeek">Badass of the Week</a> for that.
</li><li> Medal of Honor recipient Roy P. Benavidez rescued thirteen men from a <em>battalion</em> of North Vietnamese soldiers, including running over to a downed Huey helicopter and physically carrying the crew to another helicopter, and directing airstrikes while his eyes were <em>blinded with the blood pouring into them.</em> Did I mention he was only carrying a knife? He received thirty-seven wounds from bullets, bayonets and grenade blasts in the process, his guts were hanging out, and was placed in a body bag after the battle, and had the strength to spit in the doctor's face when declared a goner. <strong>He lived.</strong> Here is a condensed summary of the story: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lHkrqlT62o">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and here is the Medal of Honor <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Benavidez#Medal_of_Honor_citation">citation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> During the Second World War, the Finnish army made a point of this. Turns out it worked really well to scare your opponents. The Finns usually collected their dead during the night. Thus when morning came and the Russians surveyed the battlefield all they found were their own dead soldiers. Not knowing whether you actually killed any of your enemies (or the cold brought them back to life as Knife-wielding sniper-zombies) plays merry hell on their morale.
</li><li> Similar to the above, NVA and VC troops during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> did their best to recover their dead, for pragmatic reasons; it spooked their opponents, and frustrated US Generals who were fixated on "body counts".
</li><li> Dov Lopatyn the leader of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachwa_Ghetto">The Lachwa Ghetto <img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was informed by the Germans that the ghetto was to be liquidated and that the inhabitants would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">"deported"</a>. They tried to get his cooperation by promising that the members of Judenrat, the ghetto doctor and 30 labourers (whom Lopatyn could choose personally) would be spared. His reply was "Either we all live, or we all die".
</li><li> The US military spends considerable time and effort locating their missing war dead; including those going back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.
</li><li> When US Airways Flight 1549 went down in the Hudson River on January 10, 2009, Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger made sure all passengers and crew got into life rafts and walked the plane twice on his own (as it was rapidly filling with water, by the way) to ensure everyone was out before leaving himself. He did not leave the Port Authority facilities until all passengers and crew were accounted for.
