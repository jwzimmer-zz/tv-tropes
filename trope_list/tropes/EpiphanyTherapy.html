She tries to conquer this phobia by playing a gun-based MMO, but it's only partially effective: she doesn't suffer from her phobia in-game, but it does little to counteract it in real life. By the end of the story, she gets some emotional catharsis that helps her a bit, and she's able to hold it together when faced with a model gun for a couple of minutes, but she still freaks out in private afterward.

Often, they will appear to have dealt with an issue in one arc, only for it to come back with a vengeance a few arcs later and need to be dealt with again. In particular, it is suggested that Yui, while she gets a lot more confident over the course of the series, will have to continuously deal with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">androphobia</a> for years to come, possibly for the rest of her life.

When he overhears Xiaxi telling the story of the ugly duckling to a crying little girl it affects him deeply, causing him to take actions that are more in line with what he wants and what he's truly good at.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> There was an episode of a talk show that featured a girl with a fear of pickles, which affected her job performance as a waitress to the point of her refusing to serve any dish with said garnish in it to any of her customers. The host's proposed treatment was to have nearly a dozen stagehands emerge from the audience onto the stage and from each of the stage entrances, each one holding a plate with a sandwich topped in pickles and wearing the most evil shit-eating grins you've ever seen. The guest screamed hysterically and tried to escape in several different directions before she was surrounded. In psychology, this is known as flooding; surrounding a person with things they're afraid of for a few hours until the fear is extinguished. While it can work if done long enough, there's nicer ways to do it.

This is not a straight example because Di's solution to this is to leave her family and go live with her parents for a while, to try to stand without the crutch of her husband (who has also been suppressing the same trauma), the bitterness of her daughter (who feels jaded and unloved, and scared of ending up like Di), and the constant reminder of the event that scarred her. She's clearly scared of leaving, but is convinced it's the only way she can distance herself and let go. In another twist of the trope, she had the epiphany all on her own and acted against her therapists' pleas to continue treatment. Basically, Diana has the epiphany but is not cured.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, Guy has an intense phobia of being touched by women. He eventually recalls the suppressed memory of the incident leading to his phobia and gets a little better, but he's by no means cured. He can temporarily overcome it if, say, one of his female friends is dangling over a cliff and needs someone to pull her back up, but that's it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em>, it takes Torque the length of the entire game to come to terms with his psychological issues as he slowly figures out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">what sort of person he is</a> and his fragmented past. Oh, and fights a giant monster representing his psychological trauma, because it's just that kind of game. Even <em>then</em>, when the sequel rolls around, it turns out he's not actually cured, and facing the demons of his past causes a relapse. It still doesn't take years, but it's hardly an instant "have an epiphany and you're better" cure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>; Commander Shepard can encounter quite a number of traumatized and emotionally disturbed individuals, and has the opportunity to talk almost all of them into getting professional therapy... or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">committing suicide</a>.

<ul><li> It's apparently played straight in the first game, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Cloud</a>, who has endured all sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> and other horrors, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind">Journey to the Center of the Mind</a> that works as epiphany and he comes out of it in his right mind and ready to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sephiroth</a>. ...Unfortunately, as sequels to the game show, this burst of assurance is temporary and fragile, and comes crashing down times afterward, because what Cloud <em>needs</em> is a combination of time and skilled psychiatry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">It's a fairly accurate portrayal of how epiphanies in therapy work in real life</a>—the patient's sudden realization may boost their mood and performance for a while, but without continued work with professionals, it doesn't last.
</li><li> Cloud's plight is made worse due to <em>new</em> trauma that is piled on him in the form of Geostigmata, specifically his own and that of his adopted ward Denzell. His inability to help Denzell coupled with his own agony make him feel like even <em>more</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero">Failure Hero</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em> zigzags the trope. On the one hand, Raz helps quite a few characters get over their psychological hangups in a day... perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that he's literally entering their minds and beating said hangups to a pulp. On the other hand, some characters have ongoing problems that can't be so easily solved: Milla's nightmares (though they are at least under control), and all of the patients at Thorny Towers still seem quite unbalanced, even if they've improved somewhat.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateIIShadowsOfAmn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateIIShadowsOfAmn">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</a></em>. Each of the original romanceable characters has their own issues, and it takes <em>a lot</em> of time (and sensible dialogue choices) for whomever you choose to deal with his/her problems, let alone move past them. If you continue the romance through <em>Throne of Bhaal</em>, this even becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied Trope</a> — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> your love interest is forced to confront a wraith masquerading as someone from his/her past that strikes at their deepest fear or doubt.</span> Some of them even say that it will take more than comforting words or a good snuggle to help them get over it.

A lot of the people you meet have surprisingly deep issues, and befriending them does <em>not</em> magically fix them; at best, getting closer lets them open up to you more (and thus you find out more about their problems) and you can be there for them when needs be. Marrying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> can be hit-and-miss; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sebastian</span> gets some much-needed direction in his life and gets some appreciation from his family for once while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abigail</span> finally has the freedom to follow her dream, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shane</span> still suffers the consequences of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">long-term alcoholism</span>.
</li><li> Averted and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Celeste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Celeste">Celeste</a></em>. At the beginning of Chapter 6, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madeline and Theo have a heartfelt conversation by a campfire following their adventures in the Mirror Temple. After they both open up to each other, Madeline feels confident enough to confront Badeline, the manifestation of her unhealthy mental state. She then has a dream where she flies up to see the northern lights with golden feathers, (a new mechanic in the game) where she sees Badeline, and tells her that she doesn't need her anymore, and says that doing this will set them both free. This seems like it would lead to something good, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">goes HORRIBLY wrong</a> when Badeline goes insane and furiously holds Madeline captive with her tentacles. In a desperate attempt, Madeline tries to get rid of her by doing what she did two chapters earlier to curb a panic attack with the feather trick, but this fails hard, with Badeline ultimately slicing the feather in half, followed by throwing Madeline back down to the base of the mountain into a pit of crystals.</span>
<ul><li> The final chapter from the "Farewell" DLC is all about this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Despite Madeline having mostly conquered her demons while climbing Mt. Celeste, Granny's death and the fact Madeline didn't get to say goodbye ended up causing her to have a relapse of her depression. She ends up having constant dreams about ascending the mountain and bringing Granny back to life, while Badeline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">rightfully</a> points out this is emotionally and mentally self-destructive and she needs to finish grieving and move on. Madeline ignores this and they end up separating while Madeline figures that out on her own.</span>

The protagonist "heals" Miyako by telling her that, since they can't find the button, they should give up and rips a button off of his high school uniform and that she should use it for the doll's new eye</span>.
</li><li> Several times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> games:
<ul><li> Initial antagonist Miles Edgeworth has a near-breakdown in court (after Phoenix acquits him of a murder he's been framed for) because he's convinced he accidentally shot and killed his father fifteen years prior. Phoenix is able to demonstrate that it was Manfred von Karma, Edgeworth's mentor, and the shock makes him completely rethink his life and decide to find a way to prosecute for noble reasons.

Again, Phoenix connects the clues to pin the blame on the rightful culprit, freeing both Athena and an innocent man who confessed to the crime to protect her. To increase the irony, <em>Edgeworth</em> was the one who pushed her until she unlocked her repressed memory of the stabbing.

Thus, despite the fact that he often goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> just for kicks, and the fact that he should be bisexual when in female form, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2006-07-31">being intimate with boy-Grace causes him to panic even when he's transformed into a girl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, when Grace figures out the source of his hangup — which he hadn't even realized himself — she reminds him that this realization in itself does not solve the problem:
<div class="indent"><strong>Grace:</strong> Kissing boy-me was a very loving gesture, but identifying the issue doesn't instantly free you of it...
</div></li><li> A minor example with Susan. Her years of hating men were erased by spending one evening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderSwap">Gender-Swapped</a>. She'd been having second thoughts before then and she'd made male friends who, Tedd's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a> tendencies aside, were very moral people. That night ended up being the moment she truly accepted people could be cheating jerkasses regardless of gender.
</li><li> In a light-hearted, played for laughs example, one NP story has Sarah deciding that she wants to be less concerned with nudity. Having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">Grace around</a> will probably do that. Despite this, she keeps getting deeply embarrassed whenever Grace shows up topless or nude. Grace reassures her by saying that just because you want to stop feeling a certain way, feelings aren't convenient and don't just shut off like that. A cultural taboo that you've been raised with from birth is a very difficult thing to shake off psychologically.

<div class="indent"><strong>Faye:</strong> Therapy helped, but it's the equivalent of breaking your leg — you can walk when you get out of physical therapy, but you cant run a marathon right away. I can function as a human being right now, and even have friends, but I can't handle a relationship. <br/><strong>Marten:</strong> Couldn't we just make out now and worry about everything else later? <br/><strong>Faye:</strong> Sure, if you want to trade one night of fun for me freaking out, running away, and never coming back. <br/><strong>Marten:</strong> Well shit.

Let's go have sex!" <br/><strong>Faye</strong>: If trauma were that easily dealt with, psychologists would work pro bono.
