This could be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> (the addition of <em>scenes</em> to lengthen a story) applied to a whole franchise by creating brand new <em>episodes</em>.
</p><p>They are extremely common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a>, where many shows have 26 or more episodes per season. The producers have to use filler just to meet contractual demands. Filler is usually something entirely original for the anime, but not always; many manga — particularly weekly manga — employ filler just as ruthlessly due to the extreme deadlines. Sometimes entire filler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arc">Arcs</a> are created, most often because the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a>. Just about every long-running manga-based anime action series will have gargantuan amounts of filler over time. This is because Japanese networks, unlike Western ones, don't do reruns or season breaks. This is compounded when they go beyond the 26-episode mark. Many series air over 40 episodes per year, when they would have a hard time making even half of them related to the main plot.

However, there is also a style of filler called the "single upgrade filler". This uses a filler episode to introduce a new power, machine, costume, minor character, etc. without having to work it into the greater narrative. In these cases, the episode can be ignored outside of "something got an upgrade".
</p><p>The term "filler" is also used by fandom to refer to <em>anything</em> that isn't in the source material. This stems from the practice mentioned above of adaptations that are threatening to catch up to the source using original story arcs, episodes, and general content to pad things out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">That is not this trope,</a> see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>, but such cases are often related to it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a>: Enishi</em> contains a tremendous amount of filler compared to the first series; which is unusual, since it's actually <em>shorter</em>. Annoyingly, no single episode can be just skipped over, since the creators almost invariably throw in a scene or two of story or character development just to keep it from being <em>entirely</em> irrelevant, to the point that removing all the filler from episodes 2 through 9 would leave about one and a half episodes of relevant material.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Despite compressing quite a bit of manga into 25 episodes, some anime-original content is employed to maintain the pace of each episode, such as more character interaction within the 104th's top ten members. One specific example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Dieter</a> sidestory, which happens as they Survey Corps heads back from the 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls.
<ul><li> There's also the scene early on featuring another anime-only character, Lord Wald, which foreshadows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">the nature of the powerful individuals within the Walls.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</a></em> actually kept the story going until the Evolution arc, where everyone gets an upgrade, and the audience has to wait several episodes before the actual story resumes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>
<ul><li> Episodes 29 and 66 serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episodes</a>.
</li><li> Episode 68, which shows off the friendship between the Clover Kingdom's squad leaders, Yami and Jack.
</li><li> Episode 82, a majority of the episode is spent on Charmy in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a> that has her interacting with <em>Black Clover</em> characters in chibi-form.
</li><li> The series goes into anime-original content following the Reincarnation Arc due to coming dangerously close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a>. The author, Yūki Tabata, provided the anime a moment of relief by establishing a 6-month <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> following said arc, which the cast trained themselves up during those months off-screen so that they can take on the enemies of the Spade Kingdom in the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>. This allowed for the anime producers to create anime original content within the 6-month window to do anything they want as long as some of it focuses on Asta and company training their abilities. The filler officially began at Episode 123, though episodes 126 to 129 adapted the remaining manga content that happens before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Due to the anime catching up to the manga on a regular basis, season-long filler arcs were created. Individual filler episodes randomly occur through canon arcs, including canon scenes that might only consist of a few panels being expanded into an entire filler episode.
<ul><li> The Bount Arc was the first filler arc, occurring immediately after the end of the Soul Society arc. It introduced a group of characters who were enemies of Soul Society but struggled with keeping Ichigo and Uryuu's power issues as close to canon as possible while making them still able to function in the storyline.
</li><li> When Hitsugaya's Advance Squad was based in Karakura Town for a month at the beginning of the Arrancar Arc, the anime team decided to create a mini-arc of filler episodes detailing what these shinigami were up to.
</li><li> The Captain Amagai Arc occurred in the middle of the Arrancar Arc, lampshaded in the episode tag scenes by having the characters (usually Ichigo) joke about the unfortunate timing of the arc and having the canon characters behaving like actors taking a set break. This arc focused on a new captain for the third division as well as a power struggle plotline within a high-ranking noble family.
</li><li> The Karakurizer stand-alone filler episodes (213, 214, 228 and 287) are based on a series of manga omakes (about life in Karakura when the main cast is off fighting battles) expanded into a mini-plotline but also crash head-first into self-parody.
</li><li> The Zanpakutou Unknown Tales Arc was a plotline where an enemy turned the zanpakutou against their shinigami owners while struggling with one captain also defecting, combining an action story with a mystery story as both the enemy's and the defector's motivations were slowly revealed.
</li><li> The Beast Swords mini-arc immediately followed the Zanpakutou arc, tying up some loose ends and using the zanpakutou characters for mostly comedy or slice-of-life stories.
</li><li> The Gotei 13 Invasion Army Arc occurred after the end of the Arrancar Arc and, like the Bount Arc, had to struggle between keeping Ichigo's power level relevant to the canon while making him useable for the arc. This story centred around a mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> and her equally mysterious enemy who had the power of creating a clone army of the captains and lieutenants to serve him.
</li></ul></li><li> The second half of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em> anime is filler, containing material not covered by the original manga (or the original original novels), focusing largely on minor characters and had little to no action. It did manage to wrap up the Kayama plot from the manga, though, and it's all written by the original author, so it's canon.
<ul><li> The second season, Railgun S, follows suit; adapting the manga's version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">Sister arc</a> for the first 16 episodes, but then closes out with an anime-original arc surrounding the Febri character to which many agree to have been Railgun's weakest overall episodes and, as a result, has people considering Railgun S to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">ended at episode 16</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Any "Chii and [insert name here] Talk" episode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em>. They were considered so pointless and unnecessary to the plot that they were completely excised from the first North American DVD release, and only released as a <em>bonus disc</em> after fans complained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> had two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> episodes that the staff openly referred to as Filler; they weren't even included in the DVD release. However, many fans consider any episode that doesn't directly correlate to the war between the Black Knights and Britannia to be Filler, resulting in a lot of hate for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episodes</a> that focus on Ashford Academy. The writers possibly fired back in the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a> episode, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Milly</a> remarks (paraphrased) "There's nothing wrong with the little filler moments in life" — and in the English dub, she outright uses the word "filler".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DennouCoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DennouCoil">Dennou Coil</a></em> is mainly the story of Isako and her connection to the weird phenomena in the virtual world. This makes the episodes in which she doesn't even appear feel rather pointless.
<ul><li> The filler episodes do feature Yasako, the other main character, and her friends exploring the nature of illegals, however, which gives them a point. It could be said that Yasako is the protagonist through whose eyes the action is seen, making her understanding of the milieu more important than Isako's arc.
</li><li> And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">the beard episode...</a>

In addition, the manga itself has a plethora of cases that has <em>nothing</em> to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, or has any relation whatsoever to the continued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> revolving around the Black Organization and in the end, acts as canon filler which explains as to why the manga has been able to last for 1000+ CHAPTERS!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> was normally surprisingly good at averting this, unusual for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> anime of such length per series, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> had a little bit of a problem with it. Then came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime">Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Leaping Through Time</a></em>, where almost literally <em>the entire series</em> is filler: in twenty-five episodes, there have been only the vaguest hints of greater things going on but have been largely ignored in favor of pointless filler. The practical upshot was to leave them with just three episodes to introduce, carry out and conclude an actual plot. After the excellent high that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">its immediate predecessor</a>, especially in regard to its lack of filler, no-one was amused.
<ul><li> Being the previous contender for the most episodic installment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">02</a> was surprisingly good at averting this — but episodes 12 and 15, which featured romps through a Digital western and Little Edo town respectively, did nothing to advance the plot or characterization.
</li><li> The early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> episodes before the Deva digimon appear follow a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> format.
</li><li> Like <em>Tamers</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> also has a slow start with its first 10ish episodes following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> format. The plot only truly starts when Merukimon enters the picture.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the later episodes of the 1979 and 2005 anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> were made specifically for the anime. There are also some later episodes that adapted a particular chapter from the manga <em>a second time</em>, with updated character designs, animation, and slightly different scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, already famous for its padding, has a significant amount of filler too! The relaunched series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em>, eliminates much of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, managing to cut down the episode count to <em>half</em> of what it once was... and it <em>still</em> kept a significant amount of filler, indicating that around two thirds of the DBZ anime was either filler or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">padding</a>. Several of these episodes also contradict events that show up later, such as the origin of the Dragon Balls, who built Android 8, and that Planet Vegeta had a Kami equivalent. But while the padding and one-off Filler Episodes are almost unanimously hated, the full Filler <em>Arcs</em> are appreciated by more than a few fans:
<ul><li> The Worldly and Heavenly Training Arcs in <em>Dragon Ball</em> are often appreciated for their smaller and episodic nature, compared to the high-stakes main storylines that span continuous episodes.
</li><li> The Saiyan Training Arc was the first Filler Arc in <em>Z</em>, and is often lauded for giving Gohan some much-needed character development in his early years as he learns to live off the land and face the realities of the world.
</li><li> The Garlic Jr. Arc is the only Filler Arc to have mixed opinions, but it at least didn't contradict the main storyline; the film it's a follow-up to was the one which contradicted canon events.
</li><li> Most infamous is "The Driving Episode" in the lead-up to the arrival of the Androids, considered one of the single funniest episodes in the series due to its sheer and utter absurdity (Goku and Piccolo attempting to get drivers' licenses).
</li><li> The Other World Tournament, where Goku fought deceased warriors from throughout the galaxy's history <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Cell blew up Goku</span>, is a fun excursion that expands the fighting community from across the galaxy.
</li><li> The Great Saiyaman arc, in which Gohan is a dorky superhero (which <em>did</em> happen in the manga, but was greatly expanded for the anime), is again appreciated for an episodic structure that gives more screentime to Videl and Gohan.
</li><li> The amount of filler episodes in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> can be extremely apparent if one compares the position of the episodes in the original show when to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Abridged</a></em> version. Because a single <em>Abridged</em> episode normally covers multiple episodes from <em>Z</em> in a sixth of the time (with the exception of episode 44, which only covers a single <em>Z</em> episode) while skipping most of the filler arcs (like the Garlic Jr. arc, which is done in only one episode), <em>Abridged</em> was able to condense the first 186 episodes of <em>Z</em> into <em>59</em> episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">19</a> and 50. All in all though, the anime has a simple solution when it gets near the manga; just go on a hiatus, which it has done <em>twice</em>.
<ul><li> All filler before the 7-year-timeskip was all either cut material Hiro Mashima chose not to use or to serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>; the lone exception being the four-part Daphne filler in which Natsu is forced into a mechanical Dragon because Gray wanted him to remember a promise he made in the past.
</li><li> And after the 7-year timeskip, two entire filler arcs were introduced, one preceding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Grand Magic Games</a> and the other right after it. They were notable for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">introducing a Reborn Oracion Seis, the Earthland counterparts of notable Edolas characters (for the first), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super Powered Evil Sides</a> of the Celestial Spirits, and additional screen time for the likes of Yukino, Princess Hisui, and Arcadios (for the second)</span>. Also notable in that at least the first one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod">was made canon by Mashima</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> had more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">episodic villains</a> than there were in the manga. This is particularly in the first season, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">overtaking the series to a huge extent</a>, and wanting to put the first major fight (Kenshiro vs. Shin) at the end of the season. This involved inventing new henchmen for Shin every week and turning some independent enemies into his lackeys. The third season also overtook the manga, but stretched out the Souther fight and put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">five recap episodes</a> at the very end of the season.
</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> had some filler, <em>Brotherhood</em>, the direct adaptation of the manga, is almost completely an aversion: characters and events introduced in the original's filler episodes (like the introduction of Barry the Chopper and the Elrics removing a corrupt official of a mining town from power) are only quickly referenced, letting the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> progress in every episode.
<ul><li> The 2003 anime also averted filler for the most part (with the exception of two episodes at the beginning) due to the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">going in a completely different direction</a> with the plot.
</li><li> The sole time <em>Brotherhood</em> truly plays it straight is an unusual case of it being <em>the first episode</em>, which contains an original story with several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moments</a> that would later appear in the original form, as well as a heck lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>. Despite the very difficult genre of the anime, the staff did a pretty good job with the fillers, making them as amusing as ever. There was actually an episode in which Gin-san explains to the others what the staff <em>could</em> do in the case of the anime catching up with the manga, and one of the solutions was to make a filler. However, he also lists the cons of this — the anime could veer off its original plot because of this, and make it impossible to naturally come back without getting some complaints from the viewers. So what the Gintama staff chose to do was do reruns...if only because they didn't want their spot on the broadcasting schedule taken by another show, or their popularity diminishing in their absence and taken over by <em>new</em> anime, specifically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke">Kuroko no Basuke</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> 'Endless Eight' arc is filler taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>: the beginning and end have slight differences to begin and resolve the story, but the other six are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">almost the exact same things happening over and over again</a> albeit completely re-animated and re-voiced. Other stories of similar length were handled in 1-2 episodes. There is an "ordinary" filler episode also. "Someday in the rain" is original to the anime, although it was written by Nagaru Tanigawa. The series seems to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a>. The anime seasons cover everything (chronologically) that happens before <em>Disappearance</em>, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>.
<ul><li> It's also worth noting that, like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> examples listed below, reaction to 'Endless Eight' was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">so negative</a> that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">murdered the entire series</a> (the movie adaptation of <em>Disappearance</em> was well-received, but not enough, and there hasn't even been <em>discussion</em> of a Season 3).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensLostProperty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensLostProperty">Heaven's Lost Property</a></em> is a rare example of a manga with filler. There's no other way to call interrupting the main arc for some random perverted wacky hijinks of Tomoki (And maybe one or two pages with plot at the end). The worst part? It's a <em>monthly</em> manga. Thankfully the plot's great... when the author gets to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>: Yakusamashi-hen, the first arc of the second season. This is a subversion, however, in that the creator specifically <em>asked</em> for this arc to be inserted into the start of the season, because of details left out of the anime's first season, which would create some plot holes if not covered. The arc itself is composed of some scenes left out of earlier arcs (e.g. the game of zombie tag) and the events of a PS2-only arc, with Satoko replacing Mion as the protagonist and the plot-hole preventing details worked in.
</li><li> The third season of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em> anime, Great Guardians, has no basis in the original manga and has little bearing on the overall plot. The slightly slower pace and bigger emphasis on character interaction still make it a fairly enjoyable watch though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>: The 1999 anime had this since the manga wasn't very far into it's run. Most notably there's a lot of expansion during the Hunter Exams, including an original bit between the tower and island section where the candidates have to work together to fix their ship to reach the island. The 2011 anime averted this since the manga had gotten pretty far and didn't even bother to continue once they had covered all of the manga's completed arcs, opting for just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a> ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> was infamous for this. Although many of the earlier seasons were mostly storyline-based with filler thrown in here and there (because the manga was well ahead of the anime) many fans noted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">a deterioration</a> starting during the fourth season before the Band of Seven Arc; after this arc, the anime was more or less caught up with the manga, causing copious amounts of filler to be created in order to compensate. This led to the show's premature ending, necessitating a short revival (<em>The Final Act</em>) several years later, after the manga <em>finally</em> ended.
</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie">Is This a Zombie?</a></em> was mostly filler, due to the plot's magical chainsaw being broken. While it was rather entertaining, only about <em>three episodes</em> were actually important to the plot, with all the other episodes being retconned. What's interesting is that if it weren't retconned, the character development it would have provided from what happened during the arc would've arguably made things better.
</li><li> The television adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> completely averts this trope as a result of no TV series adaptation being made prior to the 2012 series<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wu6z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0wu6z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wu6z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although an OVA adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders</a></em> and a theatrical film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Phantom Blood</a></em> had been made prior, the 2012 adaptation was the first TV series to be made adapting the manga, and the first time that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Battle Tendency</a></em> had ever been adapted at all</span>, with the manga starting publication in 1987. By the time the animated series started, the manga had begun Part 8 about a year prior. Barring David Productions foregoing season breaks and skipping plotlines, or series mangaka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirohikoAraki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirohikoAraki">Hirohiko Araki</a> putting the series on hiatus, the series will likely continue to avert this trope for another decade.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> is more subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a>, but it does have two full-fledged filler arcs during the adaptation of the <em>Future Arc</em>. The first of which is for the Vongola Guardians to receive the flame of their respective Arcobaleno babies and a second arc which is to gain the flames of acceptance from their respective Vongola ancestors so that they'll be able to open up their box-weapons. As a result, the Future Arc was twice as long as the Varia, Kokuyo Land, Daily Life arcs combined.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UltimateMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UltimateMuscle">Ultimate Muscle</a></em> both had filler arcs that got them cancelled. Both of them got revived later, but <em>Nisei</em> was canned again and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised">The Resolution Will Not Be Televised</a>.
</li><li> Being only 49-episodes long, the fillers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em> are incredibly hard to deal with since you can't totally avoid any episode without missing out some important events. In the first half of the show, you can count around 10 battles with nearly identical situation, the villains repeatedly announce their objectives (more Spiritia!) but ultimately retreat while accomplishing nothing, boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> and the same songs being performed over and over. But mixed among those sequences are bits and bits of important information, making the show an obvious result from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> to make the show longer than it should be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> anime in the first season has a lot of filler episodes. This, however, proves to be very important when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. It also borrows several elements used in the manga too. And then on the second season there's everything involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain">Nova</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> had an episode concerning one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> neighbours of the protagonist giving him a mysterious egg, and he frets the whole episode looking after it, not knowing if he should eat it, keep it in his fridge or try to hatch it... yet MI has the <em>least</em> filler of any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">MÄR</a></em> 's anime was infamous for this despite the fact the manga was way ahead when they started it having individual episodes dedicated to events outside the War Games or focus on side characters. As well as a few arcs (particularly the Zonnen, Real World, and Ghost Chess Pieces arc) and expansion of material from the manga. Some fans do like some of the added material as the manga did tend to rush things and gave some more much needed character development to some characters. Even the final battle was expanded upon as well. But some detractors note it does needlessly slow down the plot however.
</li><li> The Anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanStarforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanStarforce">Megaman Starforce</a></em> was even worse. It had a great plot for the first half, a lot of promise. Then the creators forgot there was a plot for almost the entire second half of the series, leading to a bunch of random episodes about the FMs goofing around on Earth until the last few episodes when the creators finally remembered that there was a plot. The series was hastily ended with a lot of loose threads and a bunch of stuff that made no sense unless you had played the <em>Starforce</em> video game, and even then the plots between the two media were so different by that point that is was more of a "fill in the blanks and hope you're right" thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays">Midori Days</a></em> has an excess of filler irrelevant to the main plot in the manga's later chapters. The anime had less filler.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademia">series</a> has stayed true to the source material, with some scenes serving as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a> for moments that were rushed or skipped over in the manga. That said, there are several exceptions that are considered to be pure filler:
<ul><li> Season 2's 19th episode shows off the internships of the Class 1-A students while the main character spends the episode resting in the hospital after a hard-fought battle. Asui's internship in particular gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">a lot of focus</a> in this episode.
</li><li> Season 3's 1st episode is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episode</a> for the series, with Class 1-A hanging out at the pool.
</li><li> Also from Season 3, the 16th and 17th episodes extended parts of the Hero Licence Exam's first task by including a couple anime-only school teams that face off against Class 1-A. These filler matches include a ninja group from Seijin High School facing off against Todoroki, and the Yaoyorozu/Shoji/Asui/Jiro team facing off in a battle of wits against Saiko Intelli's all-girl team from Seiai Academy.
</li><li> Also from Season 3 is the 20th episode, which is a special episode completely disconnected from the currently ongoing Hero Licence Exam arc. The episode in question serves as a prologue to the <em>My Hero Academia</em> film, <em>Two Heroes</em>.
</li><li> Like the previous season, Season 4 starts with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episode</a>. A reporter named Taneo Tokuba arrives at U.A. supposedly doing a story on Class 1-A's life at the dorms. In actuality, he's looking for the student that All Might chose to be his successor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em>, despite being only 39 episodes, wound up having a filler arc added in the middle of production. These were the "Island/Africa arcs" (episodes 23-34) in which the entire quality of the production, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">animation</a> to the storyline, sank like a stone. They were commissioned only because the show's ratings were very high and imposed on the production team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">against their will</a>. Hideaki Anno actually had nothing to do with their production because he was so taxed with just fulfilling his original duties, and in later interviews expressed that if he could redo the series he would only keep <em>parts</em> of two of the filler episodes at most because the arc was so unimportant to the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>'s anime first went into filler for <em>over a year</em> (80 weeks to be precise) after it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioPierrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioPierrot">Studio Pierrot</a> initially took steps for <em>Shippuuden</em> to have minimal filler so as not to break things up too badly, but results have been varied:
<ul><li> Many episodes (especially the first couple of arcs, where it was <em>every</em> episode) were adaptations of a single manga chapter. However, many individual chapters of the manga contained long stretches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene">of not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition">much happening.</a> This didn't change in the anime, and led to episodes where characters did practically nothing, including an egregious one where Naruto, Yamato and Sakura stood around for 20 minutes talking about <em>how they needed to get moving</em> and catch up to Orochimaru.
</li><li> Notable about the <em>Shippuuden</em> fillers is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">they add to canon</a>. Rather than a long series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> episodes evenly mixed with random variations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> (as the original TV series did), the Ninja Guardians arc details a full-on storyline with an expanded backstory. Some arcs (such as the 3-Tailed-Beasts arc) focus on giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">one last chance</a> for screentime to many of the characters who would later die or otherwise be lost from the limelight.
</li><li> However, Studio Pierrot quickly reverted to their old ways following the Pain arc, with entire seasons of episodic plots and past arcs (even in one particular case a flashback account that trails off into portraying other's lives at the time). In the climatic War Arc, the pacing was significantly bogged down by episode-long flashbacks, some of which retell already-established events from a slightly different angle.
</li><li> The issue of fillers have come to a head in the Infinite Tsukuyomi filler arc, where a few pages in the manga illustrating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a></span> has expanded into almost multiple episodes' worth of filler, resulting in 2015 having only <em>eight canonical episodes</em>. This, despite the original manga having ended and the anime technically having only a few chapters' worth of material to adapt, leading to dissatisfaction among fans.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> didn't have very many of these (due to its being only 26 episodes long), but the most notable was Episode 7, "A Human Work". It contains no Angels, has no real bearing on the story, has little to no character development (other than Shinji's anger over Misato's slobbiness, leading to Shinji's being assured by Toji and Kensuke that knowing how slobby she is compared to her beautiful real-world persona makes them "a family"), and serves only to fill in the space between the battle with Ramiel and Asuka's introduction to the story. Though it is worth noting that despite the episodes aforementioned lack of content it does add a bit of world building and drops some large hints at NERV's more seedy involvements in the overall events of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi">Nisekoi</a></em> is a rom-com series that lasted for 229 chapters. However, there are so many one-off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> chapters throughout the middle portions of the story that a good half of the chapters could be cut out without messing with the overall narrative.
</li><li> The first anime season for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Noragami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Noragami">Noragami</a></em> ends with a short filler arc in which the main character, Yato, squares off with the God of Calamity, Rabou, in order to give the adaptation some form of a seasonal finale.
</li><li> Compared to most shows of shorter length (nearly twenty years and counting!) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has had relatively few filler arcs, due in part to how jam-packed with details Eiichiro Oda's stories tend to be (making it easy for writers to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">adaptation expansion</a>) The filler arcs which <em>are</em> present are a mixed bag; fans generally hate the Warship Island/Apis arc, but many consider the G8 arc to be good enough to stand with the best of the canon material. The Ice Hunter arc got high marks as well, perhaps because it was outlined by Oda himself.
<ul><li> The Davy Back Fight arc is a rare canon filler arc, as Oda has said it was not intended to have any real connection to the overarching plotlines of the series. Indeed, the primary purpose of the arc was to consume time, giving Robin more time with the crew before the Enies Lobby arc, where the plot is driven by her connection and attachment to the other Straw Hats and vice versa.
</li><li> Some of the filler arcs are based on storylines which Oda planned for the manga but were later cut to keep the plot moving. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmStrongWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmStrongWorld">One Piece Film: Strong World</a></em> movie also began life this way.
</li><li> After a point, <em>One Piece</em> has come to abandon filler completely, instead working on keeping a 1-Chapter-To-1-Episode-Ratio to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">a good thing too, as everything from the Sabaody Arc to the present day storyline have left no opportunities for filler arcs</a>), getting by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">using ideas Oda came up with but couldn't implement due to pacing issues</a>.
<ul><li> Case in point for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: after the events of Sabaody, the fates of the remainder of the Straw Hat Crew was given a single chapter of the manga. From that chapter, the writing staff created four episodes, covering the fates of two members in each. This was aired in-between Amazon Lily and Impel Down, due to fitting with travel time. In-between Impel Down and Marineford, the writers created another four episodes that touched upon the cover-stories that were put into the Manga during Marineford.
</li><li> While <em>One Piece</em> is good-and-all at being free of Filler, that doesn't mean that the anime is epic 24/7. It's subject to some pretty excruciating padding as it attempts to stretch the chapters out. During Robin's heartfelt plea to live, the subsequent episodes had a string of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionSequence">non-action sequences</a> where each Straw Hat had a chance to go over their backstories before moving on with the plot.
</li><li> Eventually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> became so excessive that the fans actually started <em>advocating</em> for filler arcs, suggesting that instead of making entirely new material, Toei should just adapt the cover stories like what they did with the Straw Hat Separation Serial cover story after the Impel Down and Marineford arcs. Since those are canon, there's no way they'd detract from the anime's continuity. The chapter-episode ratio meant that the plot would drag on TV, thus the advocacy for filler, so that way Toei could adapt more chapters per episode.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime only starts a new game-based arc on the day the games in question are released, in Japan at least. This has led to lots of filler episodes. It should be noted that Pokemon does not have true filler, as there is no original story it is being adapted from. Thus, what the fanbase usually classifies as filler are one-off episodes that don't further any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">ongoing storyline</a>. Early on, many filler episodes were simply the result of a carnival being in the town <em>juuuust</em> as Ash and co. arrived, or it was due to them getting lost because no-one could read the map properly. Sometimes, the gang would come across a town that wasn't even present in the games, which is reasonable, as it expands the world far beyond the original games due to the hardware limits. However, episodes where the gang gets wrapped up in helping a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneShotCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneShotCharacter">Character/Pokémon-of-the-Day</a> solve whatever problem they're currently dealing with is what usually gets called out as the defining example of a true Pokémon filler episode. Even more so when that problem is just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Team Rocket trio</a> causing trouble again.
<ul><li> Season 1 was supposed to be the only one, given it ends where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonRedAndBlue">the game</a> did so (though with some changes — instead of battling an "Elite Four", the main character is put in an elimination tournament — which he went far but lost, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">starting a tradition</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">When it had to continue</a> with the next game still a year away, a whole filler arc was made with the Orange Islands.
</li><li> The Johto arc that followed is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> due to the many filler episodes and poor pacing since it had no B-Plot to fall back due to the GS Ball subplot being aborted, so no recurring plot element before the next region. According to math, Johto comprises 50% filler (in comparison, the Sinnoh arc is only 20% filler despite being <em>much</em> longer overall). The Hoenn arc, however, was considered an improvement, as May's quest was given the same importance as Ash's and thus there were able to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting">two storylines worth of episodes</a> and need less filler. The Battle Frontier arc was a mixed bag, due to uneven placement of the filler episodes.
</li><li> A recurring variant of filler episode is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">just mash up a bunch of clips from major battles into one thirty-minute long video, add music, and call it a day</a>. The dub skips over these entirely.
</li><li> The writers did something different with the <em>Best Wishes</em> saga. Most of the episodes were devoted to the "task at hand" (whether that task be Ash's Gym Badges, then the Meloetta plot, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>, then Team Plasma). There were few fillers in these arcs, with the majority of those being Upgrade Fillers and character episodes. Since the Team Plasma arc ended six months before the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">the next (game) series,</a> the period in between was devoted to various stand-alone plots that could not fit into these arcs. <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooLongDidntRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooLongDidntRead">Too Long Didnt Read</a> version: The Unova episodes saved most of their unrelated filler for after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">all the arcs were resolved</a>, creating an "arc" of fillers.
</li><li> By around Kalos, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> filler episodes started to appear, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">previews promised a major change</a> (whether a Pokémon evolves, a cast member catches a new Pokémon, or what have you), but then the episode aired, and nothing important happened in it, reveling the episode to have been a filler all along. A noticeable example is the <em>XYZ</em> episode that fans convinced themseves implied Ash would catch a Shiny Phantump.
</li></ul></li><li> In an example of how Filler can go dangerously wrong, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised">was actually cancelled</a> due to the extremely low quality of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc">filler arcs</a>, and given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> or, more precisely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">No Ending</a>. Filler after the Kyoto Arc started nice, but went downhill. The first one (the "Christian Arc"), while having some holdings of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and a disappointing amount of fighting, still had interesting characters, an unexplored element of Japan's history, and the animation was still as nice as ever. Then came the Daigoro Arc, which had too much padding, but still some interesting moments (it was based on an official RK novella). After that, the Black Knights arc: an interesting idea (European knights in Japan), but badly explored, as the story took too long to ever go anywhere and the battles were very, <em>very</em> static. And for the final blow there came the Feng Shui Arc, which had a ridiculously hard-to-follow plot, bland new characters, random unexplained events and practically zero action. Naturally, the show was cancelled after it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> has <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.is/9WvI8">several<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> fan-made <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=23484613">lists<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> flowing around the internet called "Sailor Moon Essential Episodes". Of the original 200 episode anime, more than 50 episodes can be considered completely irrelevant filler, with an additional 50 being single plot point or power upgrade curiosities. In a bizarre twist, the complete lack of filler episodes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em> has completely thrown fans for a loop, with many people noting that it could've used some filler to explore the characters and their relationships to each other.
<ul><li> The <em>entire</em> Doom Tree arc was filler. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> only intended for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> to be a one-arc series and was taken aback by its popularity. When asked to continue the series, she did. However, the anime had no material to go off of, resulting in this arc to be created in order for the manga to establish a clear storyline for the second season. Fan response has been mixed; some people see it as a useless waste of time and ignore it while for others, it's one of their favorite story arcs.
</li><li> Most of the filler episodes at least justify their existence by featuring villain activity, often providing some characterization for the villains in the process. However, there's a couple of stories that aren't related to the villains at all, like the first season episode featuring a psychic girl, and the second season episode with dinosaurs, etc.
</li><li> One of the most egregious second season episodes comes where Chibi-usa tries to return home to the future and this backfires. At the end of the episode Minako asks her what she was trying to do so they could possibly help her. Mamoru simply says that Chibi-usa must have a good reason for not telling them and nothing more is said. So it seems the "good reason" was so that the season's plot didn't move along at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In something of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">an inversion</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> had at least three or four per season, but they are usually the funniest episodes.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> is essentially devoid of filler save for one questionable episode: Episode 16: Entire Polysynthesis. It's the equivalent of a clip show detailing the last 15 episodes to help make the transition of a 7-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. However, it has virtually no new material, accompanied by live-action scenes of a writer's hands drawing title cards and commentary statements. The eyecatches themselves are made from those of the past episodes put back-to-back, 4x4, and in chronological order, with the anime title filling the last empty square. Oddly enough, its presence makes the show end on <em>27</em> episodes, cluing the viewer in that like a normal seasonal anime, 26 full episodes were produced, but this one was tossed in for good measure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenkaiKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenkaiKnights">Tenkai Knights</a></em> usually pretty good at avoiding this, but then came the Beast King Saga. For starters, it lasts several episodes, and seemingly has NO impact on the rest of the story, other than seeing Beag's Earth form. It also artificially increases its length by having Scorpidon keep changing the rules so he can force everyone to start over. By the 3rd episode even the knights are begging for this to end already. It gets to the point where The Knights and Villius get fed up with them and decide to just beat the stuffing out of them, which ends with Scorpidon <strong>finally</strong> letting them go.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwinStarExorcists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwinStarExorcists">Twin Star Exorcists</a></em> anime adaptation is a huge offender of filler. For the first 20 episodes, canon material is vastly extended with filler moments that were never originally in the manga up to the end of the fight against Yuto Ijika. However, the episodes after episode 20 are complete anime-original content.
</li><li> Although not as much as <em>Naruto</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has a LOT of filler (about 80 episodes out of 224). Specific arcs are Noah's, Doma/Waking the Dragons and the KC Grand Prix, plus a few stand-alone filler episodes. The debate on which of those are good and which are crap can reach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a> proportions.
<ul><li> The Noah arc's status as filler was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> rather hilariously in the dub by Kaiba:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: Alright, that little detour was a complete waste of my time and effort, so let's move on and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">pretend all that nonsense never happened</a>. It's time to continue the Battle City Finals.
</div></li><li> Funnily enough, if they didn't skip over the first few arcs and chapters of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">manga</a> and adapted the DDD plot (Dungeon Dice Monsters) faithfully, there probably wouldn't have been any need for the filler arcs. The manga had more than enough material at that point for NAS to avoid going into filler hell. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">advertising for the card game comes first</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> has more of a universally agreed-upon list of filler, especially in the second season; The Crashtown arc, for instance, is to <em>5D's</em> as the Noah saga was to the original. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Except for those who wanted to see the fate of a former-Dark Signer</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Kiryu</a>)
</li><li> Team Taiyou is also considered this since no cards were released from their decks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1t34q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1t34q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1t34q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">at that point in time, nowadays some of their most notable cards were made available in real life (Zushin the Sleeping Giant, Hand-Holding Genie and Scrum Force)</span>. Even more so when they are not involved in the <em>World Championship 2011</em> game. 4Kids actually skipped over dubbing this arc because of it being filler(it was twice as long as Crashtown and unlike that arc didn't have the excuse of character development to justify it's existence)and some argued that the dub was actually stronger as a result of 4Kids tightening up the pacing(with some fans feeling like the show should've ended after the conclusion of the World Racing Grand Prix and finding Z-ONE to be a far less interesting villain than Primo)
<ul><li> 4Kids also skipped over episode 130 due to it being a completely pointless <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShowEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShowEpisode">Clip Show Episode</a> that did precisely nothing to advance the plot(unlike previous clip shows which at least did reveal new info and more character development)
</li></ul></li><li> Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> had 52 episodes. A good quarter or more consisted of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Duelist of the Week</a> episodes with no relevance to the overarching plot, instead relying on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Subplots</a> (the Genex Tournament, Crowler and Bonaparte trying to groom a student into a celebrity duelist) to set up duels. A six episode mini-arc revolved around the students going on a field trip to Domino City, but aside from meeting Sartorius's sister and some backstory on him, it too was mostly filler, and could probably have been trimmed down into four or even three episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> has Episode 3, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Yusuke</a>, as a ghost, helps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Kuwabara</a> in his dealings with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">nasty teacher threatening one of his friends</a>. Aside from a dub-added line, none of the events in this episode are alluded to again, and the next episode's Recap doesn't mention it at all — a viewer could skip from Episode 2 to Episode 4 without feeling like anything's missing.
<ul><li> Ironically the anime is an inverse of the manga when it comes to the start of it. The manga's starting chapters weren't action heavy, focusing on Yusuke just milling around as a ghost and having a few adventures before finally being brought back to life. The anime cut this down significantly to at least four episodes before that happens. In fact that minor girl character wasn't a afterlife official in the manga, she was just a ghost girl that Yusuke had to calm down and hung around for a bit before finally departing for the afterlife.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics has had several:
<ul><li> Uncanny X-Men #228: a filler issue designed to wrap up loose ends from Dazzler's ongoing book via flashback tale, made worse by the fact that the issue beforehand was the last part of the "Fall of the Mutants" storyline, which set up a new status quo for the X-Men.
</li><li> Uncanny X-Men #512: Matt Fraction does a one-off time travel/steampunk storyline which has the illusion of being important in the grand scheme of things via revealing what the Celestial in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> was guarding, but never comes to anything and makes the issue just Fraction indulging in his own writing fetishes.
</li><li> Used with Roy Thomas's run in the 1960s, especially during the Factor Three storyline. Thomas uses the lengthy storyline to flesh out details (such as the X-Men struggling with reaching the bad guys' lair without Xavier's resources) that most writers would have glossed over.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> tie-in issues for Secret Invasion, as the tie-ins essentially serve the purpose of filling in a TON of plot holes from the whole Skrull invasion storyline.
</li><li> The first three issues of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a>'s <em>Friendly Neighborhood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> series were forced crossover issues, leading to David joking that fans should just avoid those issues issues as filler and even had the first official TPB for his run called "False Start", as a joke about how issue #4 was the real first issue of the series.
</li><li> The infamous Titans Hunt storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">New Titans</a></em> was infamous for this. There are two filler issues tossed into the storyline (#80 and #81) which exist mainly to shill the newly introduced Team Titans and to serve as a "War of the Gods" crossover issue. The latter is ironic: at the time, the Titans were largely off-limits for big storylines (the book was only sold at comic shops at the time), though in this case the plotline kind of had to be addressed as Donna Troy played a major role in War of the Gods and her involvement had to be addressed.
</li><li> Filler issues in comic books often exist because of plans changing at the last minute. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> had a crossover with <em>Outsiders</em> with another crossover planned soon after. DC decided to just make the second crossover a separate miniseries, resulting in a two-issue filler arc in each book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac">Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</a></em> has Filler Bunny, a cute little bunny rabbit who was created to be tortured by cruel scientists for the purpose of filling pages when Vasquez can't come up with enough material.
</li><li> Book 5 and 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LesLegendaires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LesLegendaires">Les Légendaires</a></em> count as this: not only do they have little, if anything, to do with what was the main plot at this point, but most of the events of those books are retconned in-story thanks to Jadina's time reset. The main villain of those books, Captain Ceyderom, is the least important of all the major villains and the only one to not appear again after this arc. On the other hand, Prince Halan, who is also introduced in this book, appears again later, and themes such as Jadina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> are further explored later.
</li><li> Nicely subverted in IDW's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW">Transformers Ongoing</a></em>. Issues #9-#12 feel like a short filler storyline that develops a few minor subplots (like the fate of Thundercracker) and leads into the next storyline (which develops the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>) but is otherwise unimportant. However later on, issue #29 reveals that the events of that storyline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">may have been more important then they seemed...</a>
</li><li> Issues 8-12 of the Marvel Knights run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em>, as they were the only issues not written by Garth Ennis during the run. Issue #8 was a one-shot where Frank travels back in time to kill Al Capone<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasAllADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasAllADream">though it all turns out to be a dream</a></span> and issues 9-12 featured the "Taxi Wars" arc, which was considerably sillier (as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>) and more over-the-top then any of the other stories in the Marvel Knights run as it centers around a villain called "The Medallion" who wants control of all taxi cabs in New York. These were also the only issues of the Knights run to not be reprinted in any form(at least not in the U.S.; the Taxi Wars arc was released in paperback form in the U.K.)
</li><li> The premiere issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarWestern">All Star Western</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> relaunch is itself filler. The book's editor, Dick Giordano, intended for the comic to have all-original stories about two brand new characters, the Outlaw and El Diablo. However, as the deadline neared, the new content wasn't ready in time, so Giordano had no choice but to reprint two Pow-Wow Smith stories instead (specifically "Gun-Duel at Copper Creek" and "The Return of the Fadeaway Outlaw"), and the only new material was a prose story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryConway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryConway">Gerry Conway</a> called "Dust Under the Whispering Sun..." In short, the advertised first issue of the series ended up becoming the <em>second</em> issue.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> comics couldn't cover plots told in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> movies, so to fill up the quota, filler issues were produced for those years. The 2003 one is about the characters reminiscing about off-screen fights, the 2004 one is Vakama experiencing a bizarre vision and his team having to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> that appears out of nowhere, and from 2005, many comics can be seen as filler since the novels and the tie-in movie carried the main story of that year.

<ul><li> Roger Zelazny's <em>Damnation Alley</em> started off as a novella. When asked to write a novel-length version of the story, the additional material is mostly a completely unrelated sub-plot.
</li><li> The Level 3 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> reading books were specifically developed to tell unimportant side-stories, so as to spare the fans from having to read "kiddy stuff". They of course still bought them, some even preferring them to the author's main-story writing.
</li><li> A little under half of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> series consisted of filler episodes; they became particularly infamous and prevalent once the ghostwriters kicked in. In particular, nothing between <em>Visser</em> and book 45 — a ten-book period — contributed anything to the overarching plot, with the exception of the fourth Megamorphs.
</li><li> Glen Cook's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Black Company</a></em> series consists of nine sequential novels and one spinoff. That spinoff was released between the only two books that don't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between them, and the first of the two ended on a cliffhanger. It's not entirely filler, though; it follows the characters that didn't stay with the main party as they wrap up the remaining plot threads of the first arc, and it also has the payoffs for mysteries from the previous main book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a> could be considered an example. It only features main characters from other books in cameo appearances, and has no effect on the continuity of the series aside from a small appearance by two characters in the final book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> was originally intended to be a 9-novel series, but the books were selling so well they expanded it to 12. This becomes painful in the middle of the series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> has a lot of this, mainly in the first book, as Frodo sits on the Ring for <em>years</em> before Gandalf returns. Not to mention the one-man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe">Wacky Wayside Tribe</a> that is Tom Bombadil, where Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin stay for a while, adding nothing to the plot, and then move on. Probably more intentional than other examples, as Tolkien was writing the novel as a mythological epic, a genre that tends to include a string of events connected solely by the central characters and the backdrop of their quest.

<ul><li> Serials running for five to seven episodes or more usually include so much padding, so many contrivances, and such irrelevant storylines that they can get hard to watch. In the Third Doctor's era, the six-parter was the standard format. However, the four-part serials were essentially if you took the six-parters and squeezed out the filler. These four-parters seemed more fluid, and it became noticeable enough to warrant a change in format. Production criticisms suggested the six-part serials could have the air let out of them, because they featured a <em>lot</em> of instances where the Doctor and his companion would get captured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a> to kill time  sometimes reaching <em>eight</em> captures in one story. This was reduced in later seasons (starting with the Fourth Doctor), with a more manageable four episodes per serial with occasional six-parters.
</li><li> In particular, the First Doctor serial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan">"The Daleks' Master Plan"</a>, a massive 12-parter (plus a prologue episode broadcast weeks earlier and notable for not featuring any of the main cast), had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> intentionally meant as filler (since it was thought nobody would be watching, and viewers would be lost if the plot advanced in their absence).

The crowner, though, has to be the fifth and final season, which ultimately piddles around digging up old conflicts, introducing brand new characters, and giving a two-parter to a newly-introduced military base where nothing of real consequence happens <em>two episodes before the finale</em>; the season's ostensible point of wrapping up the war against the Espheni does not become relevant until the series finale.
</li><li> It was pretty common in the first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> to alternate between arc-oriented stories and monster-of-the-week filler episodes. The plot was fairly ill-defined and the characters needed fleshing out anyway, so it was quite bearable. Still, these episodes were safe to ignore until the third season or so, when old filler characters started to play crucial roles in the main stories. New material that seemed like filler was also harder to dismiss. Especially when what had seemed like a textbook filler-psychopath-of-the-week <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">twinned the main character</span>, changing the course of that season and throwing a monkey-wrench the size of a Command Carrier into John and Aeryn's relationship.
</li><li> It usually happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em>, where there's always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> focus and mostly all of the episodes advance the plot very little. There was one episode in the second season, for example, that showed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlie Francis</span> alive. Keep in mind, the character had already died in the show, but apart from that, it felt like a normal episode. Apparently, it had been filmed for the first season but they waited until then to air it.
</li><li> Lampooned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace">Garth Marenghis Darkplace</a></em>: Dean Learner states that so many slow-motion sequences were used because the episodes often ran several minutes short and they had to be bulked out somehow. They <em>tried</em> to avoid doing it over dialogue, but anything else was considered. (Although it seems like part of the reason the episodes kept running short was that the actors, most especially Dean Learner himself, rushed through their lines.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em> has a tightly-plotted story arc that covers the whole series and averts the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> (or even of the Fortnight) setup most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> shows have. However, there are three episodes where the plot grinds to a screeching halt so they can advertise an upcoming movie (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeiseiRiderVsShowaRiderKamenRiderWarsFeaturingSuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeiseiRiderVsShowaRiderKamenRiderWarsFeaturingSuperSentai">Kamen Rider Taisen</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KamenRiderGaimGreatSoccerBattleGoldenFruitsCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KamenRiderGaimGreatSoccerBattleGoldenFruitsCup">The Golden Fruits Cup</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kikaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kikaider">Kikaider</a> REBOOT</em>); naturally, showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi">Gen Urobuchi</a> had absolutely nothing to do with these episodes. There's even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in the first example where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Kaito</a> complains about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Kouta</a> dicking around when there are more important things to worry about.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown">Murphy Brown</a></em>, there was an episode where Murphy was slated to interview Aretha Franklin — and wanted most of the show's airtime for the interview, leading to the others' stories getting cut short. Then Aretha is running late, leading to them having to stretch and pad everything to fill up the hour.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> episode "Mr. Monk and the Game Show" was produced during contract disputes between the supporting cast and the producers. Therefore, it is unique in that of the main cast members, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyShalhoub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyShalhoub">Tony Shalhoub</a> appears, and the role of the assistant doesn't go to Sharona, but rather to Monk's upstairs neighbor Kevin Dorfman.
</li><li> Improv-heavy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outnumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outnumbered">Outnumbered</a></em>'s solution to an episode coming up short seems to be having little Karen act out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow">Reality Show</a> with plushies, and cutting that into the episode as necessary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em> was originally intended to be a seven episode miniseries. The network wanted more, and so ten standalone episodes were created and intermixed with the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>. Less noticeable than in other series with a high filler percentage, as most of the filler episodes are still good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RetroGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RetroGameMaster">Retro Game Master</a></em>: Arino ends up clearing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaSpirit">Ninja Spirit</a></em> in two hours. One of the producers gives him a phone call telling him they don't have enough footage for a whole episode and that he should occupy the audience for a few more minutes. So we get a scene of the cast having lunch.
</li><li> One particularly obvious example of this on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> was the 1985-86 season's Christmas episode hosted by Teri Garr. The centerpiece of the episode was meant to be a 'made-for-TV movie' spoof called "The Big Tree", which was split across a commercial break due to its length. However, the entire second half of the sketch was cut (most likely after 10 PM dress rehearsal) after the audience failed to respond, so the live episode has painful patches of filler. Segments such as Teri's monologue and Don Novello's 'Mr X.' commentary on Weekend Update are clearly padded out to be much, much longer than they should've been; and a sketch about a tropical island further drags out the episode by using a number of overlong stock-footage clips.
<ul><li> Any time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> airs a "Vintage SNL" on Saturdays at 10 PM, that's because NBC had absolutely <em>nothing</em> else they could stick in that time slot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV">SCTV</a></em> had "The Great White North," sketches with Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie for this sole purpose in response to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> for a "identifiable Canadian material" on a Canadian show.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> Season 2 has the first couple of episodes seem to set the stage for the rest of the series...until it becomes apparent that the resolution to this begins about three episodes from the end. The remaining episodes generally expand on subplots and have many, many instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustShootHim">Just Shoot Him</a>.
</li><li> The "Mirror Universe" episodes of the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> television series fell into this. Placing the action in an alternate universe allowed the writers to create new stories without affecting the main "timeline" in any shape or form, could result in alternate (or darker) versions of already-established characters (which was a great acting opportunity for the main cast because they got to try a different spin on their role), had massive battle sequences with real consequences and casualties...and were always forgotten about as soon as the episode was over. This was later averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>, which is intended to be a long-term relaunch of the franchise in an alternate universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both series mostly follow the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfArcSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfArcSeason">"half arc, half filler"</a> formula, but each <em>Sentai</em> series has to run for a whole year's 48-52 episodes, whereas <em>Power Rangers</em> are usually much shorter. While some fans prefer the higher story-density of PR's shorter seasons, others miss the fleshing out of the characters (the girls in particular) that the additional fillers episodes allow the writers to indulge in in Sentai.
</li><li> Early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, which aired on weekdays, were stuffed with filler, the first season in particular having run for a whopping <em>sixty</em> episodes and abstained from doing story arcs that didn't focus on the green ranger (For example, those Power Eggs in the episode with the chicken monster? They were originally the last two dinosaur eggs, a subplot that ran all the way to the end of the series in the Sentai.) The third season still had plenty of filler, but was the first to use continuing plotlines, namely the 9-episode arc to introduce Kat as Kimberly's replacement, and the 11-episode arc with the child rangers looking for the Zeo Crystal and being temporarily replaced by the proper Sentai team labeled as Alien Rangers.
</li><li> <em>Power Rangers</em> also has another set of filler episodes: usually near the end of the season, the episodes will start to use much more footage from the source material than previously — <em>Lost Galaxy</em> is a prime example of this, having done it <em>twice</em> with the Lights of Orion arc and the entire arc concerning the Lost Galaxy — in order to save money for the finale episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Swedish children's sci-fi comedy show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vintergatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vintergatan">Vintergatan</a></em>, both 5A and 5B, had children getting to call the characters and help them with personal things. These conversations could get very, very, <em>very</em> annoying. Even more frustrating in the sequel, which only had ten episodes instead of around forty or fifty — conversations on the ship between one certain alien and one certain human, mostly showing off their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple">Odd Couple</a>-sort of relationship, and serving absolutely no purpose, aside from minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> — which was forced by the plot later on anyway.
</li><li> A few seasons into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, the show settled into a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">"mythology"</a> episodes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">"Monster of the Week"</a> episodes. If you were watching for the myth arc, the Monster of the Week episodes were filler.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>: Classics</em> was a toyline specifically created to bridge the gap between the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> movie series, and consisted of radical modern updates of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em> characters.

The line was probably produced to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> enough time to prepare for the movie and the tie-in toys released later that year, although it reportedly affected their profits pretty badly — however that was partly because no regular-sized hero sets were released that year and other LEGO lines also performed poorly at that time.

The best example of this is "Turnabout Storyteller", the fourth case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em>, which has absolutely no connection to the rest of the game and has been confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to have been conceived as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> between the plot-heavy third and fifth cases.
</li><li> The campaigns of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em> are a huge offender of this.
<ul><li> For <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, the main artifact storyline spans from the Mar Sara arc with Raynor starting his search for the artifact fragments, to a couple artifact fragment search missions during the middle portions, and then finishes with the final Char arc where the combined Artifact is used to cleanse Kerrigan of her infestation. However, the middle portions of the campaign between Mar Sara and Char has three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> arcs that can be cut out completely, and nothing would seem out-of-place. These three filler arcs include:
</li></ul><ol><li> Helping Hanson deal with a Zerg infestation amongst the Dominion colony worlds.
</li><li> Helping Tosh's rogue Ghost faction create Spectres.
</li><li> Supporting Matt's rebellion against the Dominion by starting a revolt on the Dominion capital world, Korhal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">which ended up not going anywhere in the long run</a>.
</li></ol><ul><li> For <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, the three mission Kal'dir arc could be cut out without missing anything major since the campaign's main story is for Kerrigan to restrengthen her Zerg Swarm to take down Arcturus Mengsk of the Terran Dominion. However, the Kal'dir missions has Kerrigan off fighting a Protoss research colony during her search for more broods, and the only reason she continues to fight them is due to a vague threat that may result in the Kal'dir Protoss calling for reinforcements to hunt down Kerrigan. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a> where Kerrigan leaves her broodmother, Niadra, behind after killing the last of the Kal'dir Protoss does not have a resolution in the next game, <em>Legacy of the Void</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted3DrakesDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted3DrakesDeception">Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</a></em>, Nate randomly gets captured by pirates. Four levels and a sunken cruise ship later, he's literally right back where he started; the game would lose nothing if the subplot was cut. To make matters worse, the pirate captain claims to have captured Sully, and after shooting up the pirate crew trying to rescue him, Nate discovers that the captain was lying because... because.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> has several examples.
<ul><li> <em>Gears of War 3</em> spends a portion of its campaign on a long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> masquerading as the main quest-line where the player has to search for some Imulsion fuel in order to work a submarine that will get Delta Squad to their main destination. Said objective lasts 6 chapters searching for fuel within the cities of Mercy and Char. There's some neat world-building here, like Mercy being Dom's home, or how Char is a destroyed city that was victim to the Hammer of Dawn satellite strikes, but in the end, the main story throughout these chapters is just a search for fuel. The kicker that makes this true filler material is that by the end of the search, the naval shipyard where the submarine is stationed had some leftover fuel anyway. Thus, making the fuel search through the previous chapters completely pointless.
</li><li> <em>Gears of War 5</em> is the first of the series that plays around with the idea of open world exploration during its 2nd and 3rd Acts. The player can explore around the open landscapes of Act II's frozen mountain, and Act III's desert, using a sail-powered snowmobile known as the Skiff to search for any notable locations that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quests</a> can be completed at. The rewards from these optional quests are primarily for extra parts or abilities that can be used to further power-up the team's support robot, Jack.

They leave this time period again at the end of the episode. At the start of the third episode, they finally arrive back in the present.

<ul><li> In newspapering (along with the Yellow Pages), fillers are sometimes used to, appropriately, fill space. These might take one of several forms:
<ul><li> <strong>Famous quotes</strong>, fun facts or quick stories that are generally humorous in nature.
</li><li> <strong>Filler advertisements</strong>. Often, these will be "house ads," or advertisements created by an editor or advertising department selling the publication. Other times, stock ads — often, these are public service ads from the Ad Council — may be used.
</li><li> <strong>Clip art</strong> or graphics that might apply to the season or an upcoming holiday, but otherwise serve little purpose. <br/>While these were more common in the era before computer pagination of pages (which allow page designers to adjust the leading or length of a story to fit a specific space), sometimes after everything has been adjusted and there is still enough white space remaining, the editor will turn to using filler. The result is a cleanly-designed page that the reader can rarely notice the difference.
</li></ul></li><li> In radio, in the era where virtually every radio station had network news at the top of the hour and was available only by live feed, many stations used instrumental songs to fill time remaining between the end of the last song and when the network news began (or in cases where sports play-by-play ended and cutting to the regularly scheduled pre-recorded program in progress made no sense since there was no hook to catch the listener up on the ongoing discussion, or there was little time to discuss something for a live show). Stations often had a library of a few dozen generic-sounding records, each sounding somewhat like the genre they played, which were used to fill out the remaining hour, often if there wasn't a current song or recurrent that was short enough to fit the remaining time without cutting it off early. The jockey sometimes read announcements or previewed the next hour, but if he chose not to talk, the song would allow the jockey to avoid broadcasting "dead air" (silence).
</li><li> WPFM, an album-rock station in Panama City FL, broke for ABC news at the top of an hour in a 1977 broadcast. Afterwards, there was dead air for some three minutes before soft violin music started playing. Immediately, the DJ at the station finally returned to local and quipped "You learn something new every day. Today it's 'don't go to the bathroom during ABC news'."
</li><li> British ex-pirate station Radio Caroline has a clip of waves washing up and down and seagulls calling (a reference to its early days broadcasting from just outside UK territorial waters) that appears to serve the same purpose, as well as possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreExperiencingTechnicalDifficulties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreExperiencingTechnicalDifficulties">covering for when the equipment is acting up.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrewingNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrewingNetwork">The Brewing Network</a></em>: From 2012 onwards Brew Strong was criticized for having too many Q&amp;A episodes, as well as having a "Going Pro" series that went for 12 episodes. Jamil justified the number of Q&amp;A episodes by saying they receive lots of questions and they needed to get them out of the way. Listeners who didn't mind argued that Jamil, hosting two shows and running a brewery, had less time to prepare the more detailed and in depth style of show. Some critics of The Session consider the banter to be this and prefer the shows that get directly to brewing information.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>: After finishing the important scenes decorating a pharaoh's tomb, it was fairly common practice for ancient Egyptian painters and engravers to straight-up invent new gods out of whole cloth to populate purely decorative scenes on the remaining walls.
