</p><p>Slut-shaming is directed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">against women far more often than against men</a>, not least because of the cultural perception that sex is something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre">men do</a> <em>to</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes">women</a>. Thus, one 19th/20th-century Sino-European <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> holds that a man who has sex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt">is just "being a man"</a>, whereas a woman who has sex is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a>—a font of moral corruption who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">will make the people around her</a> lazy hedonists. Yet, the men are often free to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny">admire or even have sex with the "sluts" while despising them at the same time</a>. An alternative view, extant since the 19th century, is that because men are sometimes seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">innately slutty</a>, calling one a slut doesn't mean much.
</p><p>Although the slut stereotype is not commonly applied to men (at least straight men - stereotypes/stigma associated with women are often also applied to men who have sex with men), that is not to say that it cannot or does not directly harm them as well. For example, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager">men are always willing to have sex</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">a man can't be sexually assaulted, because how could he not want it?</a> Indeed, a man who is shamed for sexual promiscuity is more likely to be painted as a predator than as a slut.

<ul><li> Pretty much everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em> who finds out that Hinako <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was raped by her stepfather and had a baby by him</span> worries that Daisuke (her love interest) will consider her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a>, unaware he has known since the start. Later, when Daisuke's sister comes home pregnant and unwed, most of the town (including the mother) think the sister was shameful and slutty. In both cases, the manga treats the women as sympathetic  Hinako's experience is traumatic and Daisuke never thinks badly of her for it, and his sister is shown as being intelligent and friendly. Meanwhile, the mother comes around to accepting her grandchild and the people engaging in said Slut-Shaming are portrayed as being ignorant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNA2">DNA2</a></em>, Mako <em>tries</em> to get Kotomi slut-shamed and hence barred from taking part in an important tournament by stating that she had spent the last night in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHotel">Love Hotel</a> with her boyfriend since she had seen the two leave the redlight district the evening before. Since Kotomi stands up to her and asks if Mako has any proof, everyone immediately knows that Mako was lying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, Tohru's aunt, uncle, and cousin strongly imply that she was sleeping around and/or molested by the Sohma men she was staying with (granted finding out a high school girl was living with three unrelated men wouldn't be taken well by many people, but the Sohmas were perfectly respectable towards her and the relatives were clearly <em>mocking</em> poor Tohru). They also accuse her mother of being wanton and a slut, because she'd been in a biker gang in her youth. When Kyo and Yuki come to retrieve her, Tohru's cousin recognizes them as "the two guys the little tramp was shacking up with." In response, Yuki, in full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a> mode, gets in his face, calls him a lowlife, and warns him to <em>never</em> talk about Tohru like that again, leaving Tohru's cuz speechless.
</li><li> Fasalina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em> does this to <em>herself</em>, hating herself for being a former prostitute/pole dancer. She supports the Claw's agenda thinking it's the best way to atone for her "sins". The only other person who uses her past against her is Ray, who is portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> for most of the series, but being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">'the good guy'</a> while Fasalina herself is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a>.

It is also a part of the discrimination against Serge's Romani mother Paiva, which has become something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for Serge himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MakenKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MakenKi">Maken-ki!</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope">Zigzagged</a> in chapter 111. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">Love Espada</a> gets confronted by apparitions of male students who call her a whore for always tempting them with her body, yet never allowing them to screw her.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MM">MM!</a></em>, Yuno Arashiko developed androphobia after her boyfriend tried to rape her, and then severely beat her when she scratched him in defense; what hurt worst though was the way people treated her after she recovered because he'd been spreading rumors about her and convinced everyone that she was a slut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>: Kurumu is absolutely pissed and decides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a> when Keito calls her a "dumb slutty airhead" to her face.

The truth of the matter was, it was unintentional since Rin wasn't aware of him until after the breakup and she still turned him down.

<ul><li> Jim Jefferies, in one of his routines, argues that the common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in which women are more often shamed for promiscuity than men isn't as unfair as it sounds. The reason men get praised for promiscuity is that for them it's an accomplishment, while for women, "To be a slut you just have to be <em>there</em>". In his words, "It's fuckin' easy to be a slut. It's fuckin' hard to be a stud", and "You can be a fat ugly slut. There are no fat ugly studs."
</li><li> Dan Cummins discusses double-standards of parenting, pointing out that some fathers are excited for their sons for "having fun" in college, but no fathers ever talk that way about their daughters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdByrne">Ed Byrne</a> argues that slut-shaming men are self-defeating, as they cause women to feel bad about having sex and fear "getting a reputation," which causes men (including himself) to get turned down by those women.

<ul><li> A male example, Oliver Queen, AKA The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>, is often insulted and bashed for cheating on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a>. The problem? He didn't exactly cheat on her, he was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">raped</a></em>. Afterwards, they did turn him into a regular womaniser in order to retroactively justify this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that the first Terra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> was shown in a sexual relationship with villain Slade Wilson specifically to emphasize how evil she was by showing what a slut she was, despite there being no evidence that she ever slept with anyone else. Add to that the fact that she was 16 while Slade is significantly older, and it crosses into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">Questionable Consent</a> territory since technically <em>Slade</em> is the one who's emotionally manipulating a 16-year-old girl. Later, Slade actually gets written as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> while <em>Terra</em> is the one who eventually dies.
</li><li> In another male example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> is considered by some to be a slut and horribly promiscuous due to being portrayed as a womanizer by some writers. This leads to the same fans dismissing the scene in which he was raped by Tarantula, with the reasoning that he was a man and must have <em>wanted</em> sex from her, even though he clearly refused and begged her to stop. Years earlier, fellow Titan Mirage had committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">rape-by-fraud</a> by taking on Starfire's appearance, who at the time was Dick's girlfriend. When called on what she did, Mirage simply joked that Dick should've known something was off, and Pantha jokingly referred to Dick as a slut.

The doll actually represents Anne's feeling of guilt for having the affair, although the only reason she did was that she wanted Murphy transferred to her prison and the warden wanted her to have sex with him in return.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers">Uncanny Avengers</a></em>, the Scarlet Witch does this to Rogue, at one point calling Rogue one of her father's floozies. She brings up the relationship not in a way to necessarily shame Rogue for her "promiscuity" (especially since Rogue's powers make physical relationships difficult) but to remind her that she isn't exactly pure and noble herself, having a relationship with the X-Men's worst enemy.
</li><li> In second series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a></em> avoids this in-universe - Kate Bishop dismisses the idea that going to bed with a guy on the first date makes her a slut - but faces it in real life - apparently the angry letter from issue #3, that was accusing both Kate and Noh-Varr of not being role models and saying having sex makes them "instantly unlikable" was actually one of the few printable letters and one of few not trying to put all the blame on her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieronGillen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieronGillen">Kieron Gillen</a> addressed the thing on his Tumblr and made it clear that not only he disagrees with this line of thinking, but it personally offends him.

<ul><li> Nico has a dream where her parents berate her for being a "shameless whore" for "kissing" and "being with" multiple boys. Nico calls them out on the double standard, pointing out that her father probably dated women before her mother, and that she isn't going to listen to them. Given that Nico earlier expressed discomfort and shame over her tendency to use physical intimacy to cope with grief, the scene likely shows her overcoming her issues. Interestingly, Nico is the only one to think that way. No one else thinks badly of her for what she does.
</li><li> In an arc where the group ends up in the 1800s, Victor falls in love with a lower-class girl named Lilli, who is very physically affectionate with him, by way of hugging, kissing, and being open about loving him. Nico later says of them, "She's a ho and you're a toaster. Let's just go." She later admits that she did want to let them be together because she knew they really were in love, and her line was probably because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had just recovered from being tortured by an ancestor.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em>, both Veronica and Cheryl Blossom have been criticized many times by other characters for dressing too provocatively, being too flirtatious or 'easy', and going out with too many boys.

Etta is upset but doesn't feel she did anything wrong, especially since she turned down Pam's boyfriend and isn't interested in him.

While Lois and Clark are walking down the street, he hears someone call her a slut. She tells him theres nothing they can do about it and to just let it go. Hes upset that shes the one catching the brunt of it to which she replies of course <em>shes</em> getting the brunt of it, not him.
</li><li> Loki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valhalla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valhalla">Valhalla</a></em> gets into this against both Freya and Sif in <em>Freya's Necklace</em> and <em>The Gifts for the Gods</em> respectively, describing both of them as 'easy' to vilify them. The end of <em>Freya's Necklace</em> implies that this is psychological projection on Loki's part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">as he assumes everyone is as crooked as he is and thus anyone who shows sexual interest towards anyone is only doing it to be manipulative and would do it to anyone</a>.

Interestingly enough, Tiffany has less sexual experience than Luann or any of her friends; she's never had a boyfriend or even properly kissed anyone (she gave one person a quick peck on the mouth and another a peck on the cheek, but that's it.)

Her father kicks her out when she refuses to marry Tony Rose (Gaston) to save face. Later she moves in with Mr. Gold (her husband in the Fairy Tale world) as his live-in maid, and everyone starts to believe that she's actually his kept woman.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BeyondTheWindingRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BeyondTheWindingRoad">Beyond The Winding Road</a></em> gives us a deconstruction for a backstory. Elaine Lyman ran away from her controlling parents at the age of eighteen and returned pregnant a year later with nowhere to go. Elaine was already a wild child, but this convinced those around her (particularly her rich and conservative parents) that she was unworthy of any real help for her situation besides giving her an apartment far away from them and hoping she'd eventually better herself. Instead of helping her, it led to Elaine being stripped of any confidence she had and considering herself an unworthy mother to her child. Her depression then led to alcohol abuse (and even to her possibly taking drugs), which increased her financial problems, which decreased her self-worth—making it a vicious cycle. By the present, Elaine is a psychological wreck whose daughter Edith has been forced to take care of both her mother and herself for years because Elaine is so depressed and sick she can barely get up in the morning, and Elaine's parents only make contact with their granddaughter once a month for a day trip, completely excluding their daughter altogether. Edith herself is ostracized from her peers and authority figures because of her mother's reputation.

</li><li> Played with in <em>"Batteries"</em>, as Ryuuko is noted to be a stripper and a prostitute but, generally, the story treats her as a flawed but complex person with issues who resorted to those things to provide for herself. Likewise, the other characters see her someone as who needs help and really wants to help her, worrying about her well- being, and, like Satsuki, would like her to come home, while Nonon goes so far as to call her "the Hoe" in one chapter, to which she's called out on.
</li><li> From what's implied in <em>Foundling</em>, Yukari was on the receiving end of this, as she used to be prostitute, considering that the word, "baita" translates to "whore". From what's implied, this is one of the reasons why she doesn't usually leave her house.

It was used to undermine her credibility while they were tried for raping her. All were acquitted, in part due to this.

Apparently, he is still able to show his face in public, but it <em>is</em> a stain on his reputation, especially as there is no cure for STD. On the other hand, this trope is averted in that <em>theoretical</em> knowledge about sex is considered to make a man more desirable. The same applies to clothes - the codpiece is very much in fashion.

Bear in mind, however, that the townsfolk also want to know who the father is so that he can share in the punishment, and so that Pearl can know who her father is, so at least there isn't the same kind of double-standard one often sees with this trope.

<ul><li> Molly has to go to great lengths to hide her relationship with Fitz and flee the castle once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she gets pregnant</span>, Fitz is killed in disgrace, and the coastal duchies nearly collapse during the war.
</li><li> Fitz himself meets with a great deal of disapproval for his dalliance, but the consequences for him would never be as severe. Sure, he got killed a few times, but never for sex.
</li><li> Conversely, his relationship with Starling never met with the same disapproval, because she's a minstrel, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsASlut">the rules are different for minstrels.</a>
</li><li> Althea in the second series, in a more conservative climate, is routinely shamed for her activities, which include pursuing a man's career (sailing) and a man's sexual appetites (having any). Her niece, Malta, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">portrayed</a> as a man-eater in bud, which may be budding sexuality in a young woman or simple starvation for mental stimulation.
</li><li> In the third trilogy, Fitz shames Starling a bit when, on learning of her marriage, he turns her out of his bed. He then shames his son for taking up with a young woman when he didn't have the ability to make an honest woman out of her and gets in a fight with the girl's father over the same. Fitz receives some shame himself when the world at large believes he's gaying it up with his foreign-born employer. The Fool himself also seems to disapprove of Fitz sleeping around with women he doesn't love, but not on moral grounds; his reasons are more complex and more specific to their relationship.

<ul><li> Aubrey has never learned to keep it in his pants and frequently gets into trouble at home and abroad, not least when a mixed race son by a favorite whore of his shows up later in the series and earlier when an unscrupulous woman blackmails him with the threat of showing up, pregnant, to his wife. When, in the first book, his dalliance with a superior officer's wife costs him a small fortune and an important promotion, others defend him because "It was her what set her cap for him! Everyone knows that!"
<ul><li> When Aubrey catches an STI in the first book, he's told by Maturin (acting as his physician) that "a lady of your acquaintance has been too liberal with her affections". Slut-Shaming and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in one sentence.
</li></ul></li><li> Meanwhile Maturin ardently pursues a widow whose reputation is thoroughly blackened by "doing what a woman must to get by alone in this world". Otherwise, he was so chaste that his superiors in the intelligence community were for a time concerned that he might be susceptible to blackmail. For being gay.

However, he frequently set his characters in a society similar to that he grew up in (early 20th century Midwestern America), which meant there was plenty of shaming going on, and his characters had to be devious to get away with doing what they wanted, and never felt bad for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em> has this in full effect. When a girl falls for a beautiful man's blandishments, she feels ashamed. When a young man she's been friends with forever finds out about it, he (still a virgin) is hurt and shames her, but eventually comes around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Matrim Cauthon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a> (though the text rarely implies that he does more than kiss women, and when he does he tends to be monogamous), for which shame is copiously heaped upon him, mostly by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">women in his life</a>. Notably, Elaine is disgusted with his ongoing sexual relationship with a Queen of the country they are visiting. When he finally tries to explain to Elaine that this is an abusive relationship in which he's regularly <em>raped at knifepoint</em> and he's powerless to get out of the situation, she laughs at him, saying she's getting a taste of his own medicine. This caused much fan hate towards Elaine.
</li><li> Berelain, one of, if not <em>the</em>, most beautiful women in the series, has accrued a reputation for having many lovers and being a seductress, to which some of the female characters react to negatively. Perrin wonders if the devotion of her guards is possibly related to their hope of sharing her bed. Berelain later tells Perrin that, despite the rumours, she has actually only had sex with 3 people for non-political reasons. It can be assumed that her reputation and skills in seduction are another of her political tools as a very capable Queen of her very small and weak country, similar to her secret proficiency in martial arts.

They are saved only when Darcy pays off Wickham to marry her. Georgiana Darcy narrowly escaped the same fate when Wickham wanted to elope with her in order to get his hands on her fortune.
<ul><li> However, Lydia, unlike most characters of her time, is breezily undisturbed by what her sisters regard as such a shameful disgrace.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark">Mansfield Park</a></em>'s Maria Rushworth is forever ostracized from polite society after leaving her husband to run away with Henry Crawford, who then refuses to marry her.

</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em> when Elinor cautions Marianne about getting too close to Willoughby for the sake of her reputation. Willoughby is also revealed to have caused disgrace to Colonel Brandon's ward, with whom Willoughby had an affair and abandoned her when she became pregnant.
</li><li> Generally, any female character considered to be too flirtatious, or who breaks off an engagement to chase another man, is subjected to this (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey">Isabella Thorpe</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Lucy Steele</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion">Elizabeth Elliot</a>, and others).

<ul><li> Lord Tywin Lannister famously had his father's mistress stripped naked and paraded through the streets after his father died, but this is strongly implied to have been a case of putting the lowborn whore in her place (since she had gained considerable political power and wealth), rather than strictly because of moral objections to her being a whore. He frequently rebukes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">Tyrion</a> for his use of whores, citing the shame he brings on his house, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even though he is shown to (discreetly) use them himself</span>, and may just object to Tyrion's flaunting his activities, rather than the activities themselves.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cersei Lannister</span> is forced to walk naked through King's Landing by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> as penance for her adultery, but this is only permitted by the nobles because the political situation makes this beneficial to various players (when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> got to that part, featuring a repeated chant of "Shame!", viewers were quick to point out it counted as a <em>literal</em> Slut-Shaming).
</li><li> In contrast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Oberyn Martell</a> openly brings his "paramour" to court, and treats her very well, though it is stated that Dorne is generally more sexually liberal than the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daenerys</span> likewise has no moral qualms about having a paramour, and (while wary of the political consequences of someone openly talking about the affair) doesn't seem to mind that everyone knows about it.
</li><li> This features heavily in the series' prequels, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArchmaesterGyldaynsHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArchmaesterGyldaynsHistories">Archmaester Gyldayn's Histories</a></em>. Princess Rhaenyra's detractors, the Greens, used her sexuality as a weapon against her. They claimed that her three eldest sons were bastards fathered by her supposed lover Harwin Strong, that her uncle would take her to Dragonstone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">teach her about sex</a> in private, and that she would turn the Red Keep into a brothel if given the chance. In the opening paragraphs of <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>, her stepmother and half-brothers never missed a chance to call her a whore. One account claims she tried to seduce Ser Cristian Cole and he was so disgusted by her that he became one of her worst enemies. Another account mentions rumors that she had threesomes with Laenor Velaryon and Qarl Correy. This could be a deconstruction of the trope, as these accusations were made with the intention of discrediting Rhaenyra as heir to the Iron Throne and have little proof to support them. Only the accusation that her sons were illegitimate has some basis in fact since they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby">don't look anything like her or her husband</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yivj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yivj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yivj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The boys had dark hair and eyes, while their parents had silver hair and purple eyes. They also had pug noses and common features as opposed to the otherworldly beauty of pure-blooded Valyrians</span>. Either way, it should be noted that while Gyldayn goes on and on about Rhaenyra's alleged promiscuity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">he only makes a few brief mentions of her brothers' sex lives</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Going Too Far</em> by Catherine Alliott, the protagonist believes that she cheated on her husband while spending the weekend away with friends. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It didn't happen. The guy drugged her and signed them both in at a hotel so he could use her as an alibi while he committed a burglary.</span> Afterwards, she discovers she's pregnant. She is driven to despair, not only because her husband throws her out, but because of this trope she fears being rejected by her friends and family (who are largely sympathetic while acknowledging that her problems are her own fault) and struggles to tell her gynaecologist that she doesn't know who the father is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's her husband's baby - the other man is infertile and didn't have sex with her anyway.</span>

<ul><li> Tess' own community knows her well, and it's implied tha they have seen this kind of thing happen before (and it was not uncommon for girls who went to work as servants). They are therefore quite understanding, and might have been even more kind if she hadn't become withdrawn from shame and emotional pain (which nobody seems to quite realize). It's only when she gets involved with the middle-class Angel Clare, who had been working on the land and congratulating himself on fitting in and shedding his bourgeois values, that this trope ruins her life.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATreeGrowsInBrooklyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATreeGrowsInBrooklyn">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a></em>, Francie witnesses a girl named Joanna being harassed by a bunch of housewives because they believe she has no right to show her illegitimate child in public. They go so far as to throw stones at her, and the narrative explains that they only do this because they're bitter about their own loveless marriages.

</li><li> Ron reacts poorly to finding out that Hermione had snogged Viktor Krum. In Ron's case, it seems to mostly be jealousy due to his own inexperience, and Ginny calls him out for this when he comes dangerously close to using the word.
</li><li> Mrs. Weasley is mentioned as still calling overly flirtatious/promiscuous women "scarlet women" (Hermione finds the term silly, probably showing how Mrs. Weasley is still kind of old-fashioned in her choice of vocabulary) and is rather cold towards Hermione when Rita Skeeter paints her as playing with the affections of both Krum and Harry. However, given that she sees Harry as a surrogate son, her resentment of Hermione was really just disapproval over her seemingly manipulating and hurting Harry. Once Mrs. Weasley learns the truth, she clearly feels like a complete idiot and goes to great lengths to once again show kindness to Hermione.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aphrodite is constantly put down by the narrator, Zoey, for being a "slut", despite only being involved with two guys in the whole series, the second with whom the relationship is incredibly serious. This despite the fact that the main character has had several boyfriends (some at the same time) throughout the series. The plot also occasionally derails to talk about how bad blowjobs are.
</li><li> At one point in the series, Zoey refers to a group of girls from her old high school as "hateful sluts". Since we never actually meet them, that's the only reason we really get as to why we're supposed to be angry at them hanging around Heath. Kayla is also lumped with the group, and earlier Zoey threatens to drink her blood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for trying to date Heath after Zoey repeated said she wasn't interested in him anymore</a>.
</li><li> In the prequel novella <em>Neferet's Curse</em>, the night she became a vampire, Neferet was abandoned by her fiance because she was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raped by her father</span> and thus considered unclean by him.
</li><li> In <em>Hunted</em>, the protagonists walk in on Stark drinking the blood of a vampire girl, clearly against her will. While Zoey doesn't view this as right, she goes on to argue that Stark can be a good person and kisses him to win him over, with the heavy implication that Nyx herself wanted her to do it. The vampire girl, meanwhile, is mocked by the characters for not being properly degraded by the experience, despite them all knowing that she (and the rest of the students on campus) are being brainwashed into loving Neferet and those who work for her.

When she goes out to a nightclub, Nora and Vee whisper about how her dress is so short, her thong can be seen from under it. At one point, Nora pointlessly brings up how Marcie is rumored to put a tennis racket in the window, so boys know when she's offering sexual favors. Even Marcie's own Slut-Shaming is turned on her when Nora tells how she spray painted the word "whore" on Nora's locker. Nora adds that Marcie ought to have done that to herself.

<ul><li> Somewhat inverted. Christian talks of Ana's virginity as an "issue" or "an obstacle to be removed". Kate also mentions that she has been waiting for Ana to lose her virginity for 4 years (as if she had nothing better to do).
</li><li> On the other hand, Ana herself tends to be uncomfortable with women having casual sex. At one point, she even worries that she's being a "kept woman" for Grey.
</li><li> It's worth noting that while Ana considers a couple (Kate Kavanagh and Elliot Grey) kissing publicly to be altogether too public a display of affection, she herself gets penetrated digitally in a crowded elevator, screws in a car in full view of a major thoroughfare, a highway, and numerous businesses, and gives Grey a handjob at a large party while sitting at a table adjacent to his grandparents. None of these things are considered remotely inappropriate, even in view of Grey's insistence that Ana must always behave discreetly and properly in public.

After Jessica and her friends spend the book bullying Annie to try to force her off the team, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tries to kill herself</span> and they learn the moral that Slut-Shaming is bad. Jessica herself suffers this from her sister Elizabeth, who constantly chastises her for having many boyfriends (hypocritically forgetting that she herself often cheats on her own boyfriends).
<ul><li> An especially cruel example appears in the book <em>Nowhere To Run</em>, when a character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> comes home to find her practicing the drums with her bandmate.

Because of her mother's (justified) reputation for promiscuity, Anya was bullied and sexually assaulted by both genders. In a futile attempt to stop the mocking, she dressed conservatively and rarely asserted herself socially. (She eventually realized that if people were going to bully her regardless of what she did, she might as well dress and act however she liked.)
</li><li> Victor Hugo's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em> presents the tragically ironic tale of Fantine, who became pregnant following a summer fling. When this news reached the town of Montreuil sur Mer, the Slut-Shaming she faced, barred her from legitimate work, forcing her to prostitute herself to survive and provide for her daughter, increasing the Slut-Shaming that she faced.

</li><li> In the Parthelon series, by PC Cast, Rhiannon is subjected to this almost from the first instant she's brought up in the narrative. All of the characters view her as spoiled and a bad person overall for sleeping around with multiple partners and refusing to be monogamous for even a year. While she <em>is</em> revealed to have done genuinely amoral things, Shannon tends to forget about those in order to make mean-spirited jokes about what a slut Rhiannon is. It becomes considerably more unsettling when the second book reveals that this behavior stems from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her first sexual encounter being rape</span> and it being hinted in a flashback that Rhiannon still being a virgin was the reason she acted reserved when faced with a handsome naked man.

The golem marries a human who doesn't know what she is, and when they engage in "marital duties", it's all good for him...but the one time it starts stimulating her in a pleasurable way and she moves to pursue that, he thinks it's "immodest" and unbecoming of a wife.

What's especially bad about this is that while Cindy <em>is</em> promiscuous, she isn't related to, cheating on, nor cheating with any of the boys she sleeps with, unlike those condemning her; Cathy has been involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> for years, while Bart is currently having an affair with his brother's wife (and she isn't the first married woman with whom he's dallied).

Then she's hit by a scandal. Apparently, years ago, she slept with a movie director, who later turns out to have been already in a relationship with a famous movie star. When the truth comes out, the director blames Bubble Bubble for "seducing" him, possibly using a secret Super ability (despite the fact that her abilities are well-documented). Her reputation destroyed, she nearly gives up, but Titan convinces his agent Lenny to take her on, and Lenny tells that the best (and fun) option she has is to rebrand herself and own what she really did (i.e. have consensual sex with a man, who lied to her about being single). She goes on a talk show, dressed in more normal clothing (halfway between "prudey" and "slutty"), where the host immediately pounces on her for the sex. She counters by point out that, yes, she had sex with a man she thought was single, but that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. When the shocked host tries to recover and bring up her being a role model, she keeps pressing him and insisting that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> on sexually-active women needs to go away. While some conservatives still grumble about her behavior, the majority accept her new "brand", resulting in the director once against being the subject of the scandal.

Part of her step over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> is establishing she is <em>not</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">Ethical Slut</a>, but rather somebody who uses other people for sex and discards them without regard for their feelings (or <em>life</em> in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Xander</span>'s case). In her introduction scene, the first name she is referred to (by Cordelia) is <em>Slut-orama</em>.

</li></ul></li><li> Similar to <em>Buffy</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> punished Cordelia for one-night stands (with two mystical pregnancies, no less). However, characters tended to be more concerned with whether or not someone was having sex with Angel and unleashing his evil alter-ego.
<ul><li> In one of the cases, Cordelia suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> over waking up magically pregnant and numbly says that she's "being punished".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a>'s</em> Sarah Walker frequently uses her body to get information, get past guards, and so on. This makes Chuck (entirely smitten) jealous and uncomfortable, and he occasionally attacks her for it. The one episode where Chuck is the one who is required to seduce a female arms dealer, they have to bring in an experienced spy to train him (Casey can't because he actually <em>failed</em> that part of his training). Meanwhile, Sarah's main concern is that he doesn't get himself killed rather than this trope.

Her mother is shocked and disgusted, and her reputation suffers immeasurably when the rumor spreads to London. Everyone involved, including the young woman herself, treats it as though she had willingly seduced the man, although from the point of view of a modern audience she offered only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">Questionable Consent</a> at best and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">sexually assaulted</a> at worst.

</li><li> Its second season gives us Ethel, a new maid brought in during the war, as Downton is converted into an adjunct of the hospital to help with injured, convalescing veterans. Ethel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodLookingPrivates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodLookingPrivates">loves a man in uniform</a>, literally. She's caught in the act by the head housemaid, and is sacked without notice and without references. When she winds up pregnant, the same head is sympathetic, and still helps as much as she can, even trying to shame the officer who got her pregnant (and who rebuffs the attempt).
</li><li> In the fourth season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edith</span> fears this happening to her if she keeps her illegitimate baby (which was conceived with a man she loves and would be married to, if not for a legal issue he was in the process off working out when he disappeared).

In "Penumbra," when Ezri and Worf find themselves stranded on a distant planet following a poorly thought out rescue plan driven by lingering feelings of affection for Worf, the two get into a bitter spat when Ezri lets slip that Jadzia had been with other men before him. Worf, who has some very conservative ideas about romantic relationships, takes it poorly and calls Ezri (and by proxy, Jadzia) a "<em>sli'vak</em>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon">the Klingonese word for "slut"</a>.
</li><li> The pilot to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> gives us Monica sleeping with a man on the first date. The show didn't make too much hay of it, but the executives were worried the public would blame her, so the producers polled the live audience. However, Phoebe wasn't made to feel bad for her sexual activity. Joey was given was only given a hard time for his rampant womanizing when he mistreated women.

At the same time, part of his problem was that he gave her his, and the revelation that they might not have lost it to each other "rewrites their history."
</li><li> Ted's generally after true love and not one-night stands. When he does have one-night stands, the response is varied, from treating it as a trivial detail ("The Pineapple Incident"), to heroic ("The Third Wheel"), to despicable ("No Tomorrow").
</li><li> Robin has fewer conquests than Ted, but she's had a one night stand with Mitch, inventor of The Naked Man!. After the gang spends a few minutes admiring Mitch's ingenuity, Marshall says, "I call slut!" Robin spends the majority of the episode trying to justify what she did so she doesn't feel bad, but Marshall ends up taking back the slut comment after Lily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">successfully uses</a> the Naked Woman on him, showing that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not So Above It All</a>.
</li><li> The various women that sleep with Barney are usually referred to by other characters as sluts, skanks, hoes etc. The episode "Say Cheese" similarly has Lily making a game of naming Ted's "random skanks" that he keeps bringing to important events, not realizing the irony that all the girls have in common is having dated Ted.

One of the problems the prosecutors often face is that while they're trying the defendant, the defense is trying the victim. Once a victim is shown to have had sex with more than one person, it becomes a concern that the jury will assume she deserved murder or rape. However, the show portrays the female targets of slut-shaming as innocent victims of unwarranted harassment. Promiscuous men, on the other hand, are treated as though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil">they must be guilty of something</a> by detectives (especially Benson and Stabler). Even when they don't turn out to be guilty of a crime, promiscuous men are never portrayed positively.

The men are free to romp, so long as they're discreet, and other men don't particularly care, but if a woman steps toe over the line, she's torn apart. Peggy Olson gets it particularly bad from her family and her priest for having a baby out of wedlock.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> tended to treat characters badly if they had sex outside of a committed relationship. Men were ostensibly excused if it had been long enough, but they were portrayed (and treated) as somewhat pathetic.
<ul><li> Played with in a first season episode where Elliot has a one-night stand with a surgeon who turns out to be a jerk, telling everyone the juicy details and bragging about his conquest. At first she's mortified (and feels betrayed because Turk joins in with a few comments about how nice her butt is), but she ends up deciding that she likes at least being known around the hospital where she was previously invisible to everybody (plus it's so far off from her actual personality that it doesn't bother or shame her much).

<div class="indent"><strong>Denise:</strong> I don't know why I keep jumping into bed with him. My confidence is shot from screwing up that spinal tap last week, and then yesterday I misdiagnosed an ectopic pregnancy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInAusten">Lost in Austen</a></em>: Darcy shames Amanda when he discovers she's previously lived with another man (although he is not aware that she's from the 21st century), emphatically stating that he cannot marry a woman who is "not a maid". Lydia elopes with Bingley rather than Wickham (see Literature below for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>), but they avoid scandal when they admit nothing sexual happened between them. Jane ultimately annuls her marriage to Collins so she can be with Bingley, but her reputation is so damaged that they move to America. Wickham and the Darcys agree to pretend that Wickham raped Georgiana so she will be saved the shame from having made advances towards him.

The show really, <em>really</em> loves to give Grayson shit. In the third season, Lorie and Ellie get in argument over who's sexier and have to settle it by finding someone they've both slept with. Travis goes through their lists (multiple pages each), finds one person they've both slept with, then calls them both ho's.
</li><li> A rare male example on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> where Sue shames Will for his interest in Emma while still technically married to his wife.
<ul><li> In the episode "Bad Reputation," Emma calls Will out for making out with Shelby and letting April sleep over. "You're a slut Will, you're a slut you're a slut..."
</li><li> While practicing for their duet, Brittany carries Artie to her bed and divests him of his virginity. He breaks up with her the next day because it was less important to her than to him; he thought she was just using him for his voice (to win a competition) and that sex was part of that.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ordinarily, Bones is quite sex-positive. However, in the first episode of the fourth season, when a victim's father described her as a very good girl, Bones said "Not all the time" and showed him a tabloid rag with his daughter (a wealthy heiress) topless on the front page.
</li><li> A few episodes later, she's dating two men at once, one with a purely physical connection, the other purely mental. Booth spends a significant amount of time attacking her for it. However, the show itself only calls her out on the fact that she was deliberately hiding the other relationship from each man. Then they accidentally run into each other at a restaurant and each man is hurt, the one for Bones thinking he's a beautiful idiot, the other for the exact opposite reason.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>, Blanche Devereaux is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">Ethical Slut</a> whose reputation as a man-chaser precedes her. This results in an enormous amount of snark from her roommates, especially the elderly Sophia, but most are good natured and not meant in malice. Blanche is actually very proud of her promiscuity and holds herself to the standard that she will never be a mistress and always practices safe sex.
<ul><li> In the early episode "The Triangle", Dorothy's boyfriend makes a pass at Blanche, but Dorothy refuses to believe her because she thinks that Blanche is jealous of their relationship and calls her a slut. This also happens when Dorothy thinks Blanche is sleeping with Stan (Dorothy's ex-husband) and doesn't believe Blanche when she says that she isn't.
</li><li> When Rose's daughter, Bridget has a one-night stand with Dorothy's son, Michael, Dorothy initially directs her anger and embarrassment at her son. Eventually, she turns the blame onto Bridget for the incident. Rose doesn't react much better, bemoaning that her daughter's first time was a meaningless fling and then shutting down further when told that it wasn't Bridget's first time at all. With great effort, all parties come to terms with the fact that these are two mature adults who consented to have sex together.
</li><li> When Blanche is photographed leaving a political candidate's home late at night, her friends refuse to believe that all they did was talk, especially when the politician declares he had an affair with Blanche at a press conference. They finally believe her when the guy admitted he lied, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and that he's a post-op transsexual.</span>

The next day, she goes out with Cory and doesn't kiss him once, but asks to see him again, as she wants to take things slow and be serious. When Shawn questions her on this, she bluntly tells him that she might actually consider Cory as a potential boyfriend because he's a "nice boy", whereas Shawn is only good for casual fun and only gets dates from so many girls because he's good-looking and has a reputation for being easy.
</li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scandal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scandal">Scandal</a></em>, Pope's team are investigating a missing girl and as soon as it becomes clear that she was the anonymous blogger outing the sexual prowess (or lack thereof) of various members of the DC power elite, one declares, "Oh boy; let the Slut-Shaming begin." As far as some news outlets are concerned, this isn't a missing girl, but a missing whore.
</li><li> This is what most of the jokes about Laurie Foreman boil down to on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em>. If she acts mean or nasty to her brother Eric or anyone else, they'll retort with a joke about how's she a whore. Because apparently her nastiness and her tendencies to sleep around are one and the same.
<ul><li> It wasn't just Laurie. Even though it was a show about teenagers in the swingin' Seventies most of the cast would make fun of their classmates for their alleged promiscuity. While it made sense coming from shallow vindictive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> Jackie, it was hypocritical coming from self-proclaimed feminist Donna, or blatant anti-establishment Hyde, or Eric who was too much of a loser to judge anyone.

</li><li> A patient who hears about Derek's affair with Meredith starts acting like a jerk to her. Derek's wife Addison tells her to stop and that Meredith didn't do anything wrong.
</li><li> Izzie also gets this when Alex finds out that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasYoungAndNeededTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasYoungAndNeededTheMoney">used to be a lingerie model</a>. Izzie refuses to feel ashamed about it, saying it helped get her through med school and she was the only intern there who wasn't in financial debt because of it.

</li><li> April <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">does this to herself</a> in season 9. After losing her virginity before marriage, she feels extremely guilty and like she's a bad person, even though everyone else tells her that's not the case.
<ul><li> Of course, the real reason for her guilt is because she enjoyed it so much.
</li><li> Later, she meets a nice EMT, who tells her that he's saving himself for marriage. She lies that she's also a virgin. Later, she admits the truth, when she finds out that he doesn't care if she's a virgin, only for him to leave because she lied to him.
</li></ul></li><li> Early on, after Sloan has been there for a while, Dr. Bailey gathers him and all of the female doctors and nurses, points to Sloan, and says, "This man is a whore!" She then explains why the women shouldn't expect more from him than they're getting. (Imagine that one gender-swapped.)
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly, given that the show's main character is a succubus, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostGirl">Lost Girl</a></em> didn't deal with any Slut-Shaming, meta- or in the show, until near the end of the first season, when the monster of the week was one that fed off sexual shame and drove its victims to suicide after covering their homes with graffiti like "SLUT", "DIRTY WHORE", and "SKANK". This bad guy's species is the natural enemy of succubi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseMD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseMD">House, M.D.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Greg House MD, in his never-ending quest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">piss off absolutely everyone in existence</a>, did this a lot. In the early seasons, he wouldn't <em>shut up</em> with harassing any woman who shows even a mild sign of being attractive, <em>for</em> being attractive, bouncing back and forth between calling it unprofessional and just sexually assaulting them with words.
</li><li> In the sixth season, a patient of the week is a porn star, as is his wife, and he's quite proud of his job. Cameron spends the entire episode attacking him for it, and even compares him negatively to someone who committed murder... because the murderer feels bad about it.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> starts with this. A cheerleader is shamed during lunch at school for sleeping with a guy and even for her choice of position (after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">only a slut faces away from the guy during sex</a>). It's never revealed if the rumors are true or not, but it does cause her to lash out at a random nerdy girl and subsequently get beat by the girl (possessed by a vengeful spirit) to death in the bathroom.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter">Agent Carter</a></em>, the series doesn't shy away from a realistic display of mid-twentieth century attitudes about women and sex.
<ul><li> <em>Everyone</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PeggyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PeggyCarter">Peggy Carter</a>'s office assumes she's only there because she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s lover, and tailor their ridicule accordingly— in reality, it was the other way around: Steve Rogers couldn't have pulled off his reputation-making mission if Peggy hadn't been there to encourage him and iron out the logistics. What's more, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when they find out she's working with the fugitive Howard Stark, they all assume she's doing it because they're having an affair, and not for money or friendship.</span>
</li><li> Her landlady maintains a "home for respectable women" and doesn't just kick a girl out for having a boyfriend "above the first floor", she kicks her out in front of <em>everyone</em> at breakfast.
</li><li> Howard is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> by most for his many girlfriends, but ultimately it serves to get him in trouble, as the first season's plot turns out to have been kicked off by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Howard showing off his secret weapons vault to a date who was actually a Russian spy</span>. Several of his jilted girlfriends point out that any woman who went through as many partners as he has would be called a floozy.
</li></ul></li><li> A second-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> deals with the search for an eighteen year old who ran away from home and started doing porn. She spends some time hating herself for what she's done, calling herself toxic and asking "Who would want... someone like me?" Her father is also a piece of work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman">Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</a></em>. The revelation that a white woman rescued from an Indian camp actually married one of them results in basically the entire town doing a 180 on their treatment of her—initially incredibly sympathetic and concerned for her, they all turn out as Dr. Quinn and her family try to take her to church, declaring "that Injun' whore isn't welcome here."
<ul><li> This even happens to Dr. Quinn herself. When her foster children's natural father comes to town to fight her for custody, he puts a spin on her romantic entanglements by pointing out that within one calendar year, she was engaged to three different men (only one of which, to Sully, was legitimate. The first being a misunderstanding from her brief courtship with the Reverend, and the other being the result of her presumed-dead fiance still being alive), and trying to make her relationship with Sully himself seem improper.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens to Elaine in the series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>, when one of the many character witnesses against them testifies about her coming into his drugstore to buy out the entire supply of contraceptive sponges. His disgusted tone and the shocked reaction from the courtroom is clearly meant to convey that Elaine is promiscuous. Ironically, not only was she not, but even if she had been, her desperate need to conserve the sponges made her LESS inclined to sleep around, as evidenced by the ridiculous interview/screening process she put a potential lover through.
<ul><li> In an earlier episode, when she asks a coworker about why she's so averse to using or touching anything that she herself has used, the woman admits "You seem to be with a lot of men. . ." Elaine angrily and rightly tells her that aside from her attitude being offensive and ignorant, her personal life is none of the woman's business. The woman agrees it isn't, but she's shown to be a germaphobe and irrational about this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>: Betty Karen does this to Veronica Brenda, citing her flirtatious nature, In standing up for herself, pointing out she has slept with only <em>one</em> guy, Brenda ends up doing this to Karen, pointing out that <em>Karen</em> is the one who has spent several months flitting between two different guys. Karen also gets this from her ex-boyfriend Jason and his brother AJ following their breakup. They all have a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> several months later after learning that Karen was sexually abused as a child—and when she confronts him, her attacker does this too.

She shuts them both down, hard. She didn't know he was married and feels no shame whatever about a one night stand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conviction2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conviction2016">Conviction (2016)</a></em>: The victim in the second episode was afraid of this if people knew she'd had casual sex with a married co-worker earlier on the night of her attack, and thus didn't mention it. Unfortunately this helped to get some innocent men convicted, as the physical evidence was thought to be from rape. Afterward her fears are proved correct as the media hounds her about this, despite Hayes's attempt to stop it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHandmaidsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHandmaidsTale">The Handmaid's Tale</a></em>: As part of the Handmaids' training, they have the group shame a young woman who was gang-raped, as she supposedly "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVictimsBadVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVictimsBadVictims">led them on</a>". This is particularly poignant since Offred is mentioned as writing about sexual assault before in a flashback.
</li><li> In the second season of Chinese drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OdeToJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OdeToJoy">Ode to Joy</a></em>, Ying Ying's brief relationship with her manipulative manager in the first season comes back to haunt her when introducing her new boyfriend to her friends. Some good-natured teasing from Xiao Xiao towards Guan Ju Er over being the only virgin in the room inadvertently reveals that Ying Ying is not a virgin, which results in her boyfriend dumping her and his mother disparaging her character. However, everybody else considers this sort of attitude beyond old-fashioned and misogynistic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a></em>. All of the girls do this to each other at varying intervals:
<ul><li> Brenda taunts Kelly about her previous reputation as the school bimbo after running into Kelly on a date with her ex-boyfriend Dylan. Throughout the series, it was well established that this was a sore point for Kelly.
</li><li> Brenda herself gets this when she's wrongly accused of using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingCouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingCouch">Casting Couch</a> to secure the lead in the school play.
</li><li> They, along with Andrea and Donna, apply this to newcomer Emily Valentine, upon noticing her flirting with all of the guys in the group. Especially bad as that's ALL she's doing—despite her unconventional looks and "Bad Girl" attitude, Emily is just as virginal as the latter two.
<ul><li> Emily herself accuses Brandon of treating her like a tramp after he breaks up with her even though he's actually done nothing of the sort—although he's (rightfully) complained about her crazy behavior, he's said nothing to indicate that she's promiscuous.
</li></ul></li><li> Valerie gets this after coming to town — from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Kelly</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Promised Land</em>. Dinah Greene is assaulted when walking home late from her hospital job. When confronted by her would-be rapist a few days later, she pleads for mercy, asking how he would feel if someone were attacking his own daughters like this. He angrily declares, "<em>My</em> daughters are good, decent girls! They don't go walking around late at night!", insinuating that Dinah deserved to be assaulted because of her behavior.
</li><li> While the exact word isn't used, Eleanor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bramwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bramwell">Bramwell</a> gets this from her father after he learns that she had a romantic weekend with her boyfriend — a major taboo in the Victorian England setting of the series. Later in the series, her fiance (a different man), does the same thing after she admits that she cheated on him.

While Alba is an overall good grandparent and sympathetic character, and Jane takes the lesson to heart, her views on sex are presented as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">outdated</a>, and Jane clearly has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex">issues</a> relating to her sexuality. (Though she fortunately realizes on a logical level that a woman's choice to have sex doesn't define her character, and it's nobody else's business.) Alba also has a nasty habit of slut-shaming her daughter Xo, which really gets on the latter's nerves. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then we find out Alba herself wasn't a virgin when she got married. When Xo finds out, she's understandably <em>furious</em>, calling Alba a hypocrite — something even Jane is forced to agree with. It gets a <em>little</em> more understandable when Alba reveals that while her husband didn't care that she wasn't a virgin, she was treated like a whore in her hometown, and her family basically disowned her when they found out</span>.

In the first episode, Cassie's nude photos become distributed, and the guys all assume that she's some kind of sex fiend, when in reality she's no more sexually active than any of the other girls. In the second episode, Kat has to deal with the fallout from footage of her having sex being put online.

Jill decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">call her out, pointing out that those women are the same as them and could even be like them and they just want a fair shake and go to work with no issues</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice">The Practice</a></em>: In "Civil Right" Eugene attacks an alleged rape victim's testimony by pointing to what she wore on the night of her date with his client, implying that as she was in a revealing dress, she was "asking for it." This appears to be Eugene's <em>go-to</em> strategy when defending clients in rape cases, as we see him utilize the same tactics with another case near the end. He gets rebuked publicly for it by the victim, and the judge finds this all disgusting (though he can't stop such questions) and Eugene feels terrible about doing so. However, he keeps doing it in defense of his client.
</li><li> A male version on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, where Doug Ross' womanizing behavior was rarely, if ever, seen as positive. At best, it was a source of ridicule, at worst—after he brought in one of his random nameless one-night-stands dying from a drug overdose—outright contempt and disgust, and overall, indicative of him being a very troubled individual. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> Luka Kovac had an equally similar story arc.

She <em>could</em> have been trying to make a statement about how sometimes people, especially younger ones, jump into sex before being truly ready and properly prepared to deal with the potential consequences, but it doesn't come across that way and instead came across as this trope. Justified, however, as she was quoting what her best friend actually said about it at the time.
</li><li> "You Belong With Me" has the lines "she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts" and "She wears high heels, I wear sneakers" which imply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses">this makes the girl unsuitable for her love interest.</a>.

The song takes multiple shots at an woman who is regretful for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">"what [she] did the night before"</a>, hitting on (and sleeping with, if the spoken word intro is anything to go by) other guys when she claims to have a boyfriend, and blaming her actions on having too much to drink, among other things - however the song later states "You're getting around/I'm not putting it down/It's just what it is/Getting it while it's around", so the song plays the trope straight and subverts it at the same time.
</li><li> Salt-n-Pepa lashes out against this in the song "None Of Your Business" - which also doubled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards their critics.
</li><li> The girl posse attempts to do this to Maggie, a former prostitute who became one of Hero's disciples, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hero">!HERO: The Rock Opera</a></em> song "Leave Here."

She ends up pregnant and goes to get an abortion. She brings her best friend, who herself had been molested in the past, and it goes normally enough. When they go back to college apparently Melissa spread rumors that the protagonist was a "crack whore" and they stop talking... Except for the fact they're going to a Blur concert together soon.

<ul><li> Subverted somewhat in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. While it doesn't think highly of sex outside of marriage ("No adultery" is one of the Ten Commandments, for starters), it treats adulterers as people instead of dirty whores, with A) Jesus big on redemption and atonement, not punishment, and B) shamers being reminded that their sins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">aren't any better than those of the shamed.</a>
<ul><li> The Pharisees bring an adulteress before Jesus and ask what he thinks should be done with her. According to Jewish law, she should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">be stoned to death</a>. Jesus said to the crowd "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone." When everyone in the crowd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">realized they were sinners</a>, they all left. Jesus then told the woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAndSinNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAndSinNoMore">Go and Sin No More</a>.
<ul><li> Some have claimed that Jesus was actually calling them out on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>-under the Mosaic Law, both adulterer and adulteress should <em>both</em> be put to death-but where was the man?
</li></ul></li><li> A similar story appears in Genesis — Judah condemns his widowed daughter-in-law, Tamar, to death for getting pregnant out of wedlock. It turns out the conception was when Tamar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">dressed like a prostitute and slept with Judah</a>, who was trying to weasel his way out of a levirate marriage (marrying his brother's widow). When Tamar reveals this, Judah admits that she is more righteous than him; they don't become a couple, but the twins she gives birth to become Judah's heirs.
</li><li> Another incident happens with another woman named Tamar when she is raped by her half-brother Amnon. After the ordeal is done, she demands that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherIWantToMarryMyBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherIWantToMarryMyBrother">marry him</a> in order to keep what is left of her honor since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">time's culture dictated that a rapist should marry his victim to compensate for her lost virginity</a>. However, Amnon disdains her saying that it was her fault for causing him to lust after her and casts her away in disgust. As a result, Tamar says <em>his rejection of her is considered even worse than the rape itself</em>.
</li><li> As with the above Jesus example, there was another incident with a woman at a well who gave Jesus water. Jesus asked her to draw a cup for him and she tried to refuse the request for being both a Samaritan and an adulteress (an adulteress at the time could mean a number of things). Jesus knew this and didn't mind either one. The detail in the story that it was about noontime has made some commentators think the woman was already being slut-shamed by her community. Why was she was getting water at the well alone at that hot hour instead of say earlier in the morning with many other people? Because she was avoiding them.
</li></ul></li><li> After the dice game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a></em>, Karna calls Draupadi a slut for having five husbands (even though, as stated earlier in the narrative, she is not the first woman to do so...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">and men were permitted to take multiple wives, mistresses, and concubines</a>), and uses her "sluttiness" as justification for why she should submit to his and Duryodhana's sexual advances in front of his court. Later, she tells Krishna what went down, and he says he'll make it right, that no woman (especially one as pious as Draupadi) should be treated that way.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SorlisTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SorlisTale">Sorli's Tale</a>", Freyja, who in this tale is Odin's concubine, sleeps with four dwarfs in exchange for a necklace. Odin makes Loki steal the necklace and when Freyja goes to Odin to get it back, he calls her out for her bargain. Meanwhile, our knowledge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> suggests Odin is simultaneously married to Frigg and had plenty of extramarital affairs even besides Freyja.
<ul><li> Subverted in the older Lokasenna, where Loki attempts to slut-shame Freyja, only for her father Njord to defend her by saying that there is nothing wrong with a married woman having a lover. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestYayShipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestYayShipping">Said adultery is about Freyja sleeping with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Freyr</a>.

Fantine retaliated earlier by saying that she's not the only worker without a sexually clean history and given that she's been refusing the foreman's advances, more than a little of the accusations are them just trying to get rid of her out of spite.
<div class="indent"><strong>Workers:</strong> While we're earning our daily bread/ She's the one with her hands in the butter!/ You must send the slut away/ Or we're all gonna end in the gutter!/ It's us who'll have to pay/ At the end of the day. <br/><strong>Foreman:</strong> I might have known the bitch could bite/ I might have known the cat had claws/ I might have guessed your little secret./ Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine/ Who keeps herself so pure and clean/ You'd be the cause, I have no doubt/ Of any trouble hereabout/ You play a virgin in the light/ But need no urgin' in the night!

Audrey is heavily implied to have been a stripper to make ends meet, and is ashamed of this, seeming to think she deserves the abuse she suffers at the hands of her boyfriend Orin because of it. (Unfortunately, this line of thinking isn't uncommon, especially with people who already have low self-esteem as Audrey does.) Orin seems to agree, even outright referring to her as a slut at one point. Notably, Seymour, who's deeply in love with Audrey and thinks she's a wonderful person, doesn't care one bit about her former job, pointing out that she was simply making a living.

Not only does Iago's slut-shaming of an innocent woman ultimately get her killed (even though she never even cheated on her husband), but Emilia has a rather impressive monologue in which she points out that some men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">deliberately</a> cheat on their wives, while many women who cheat on their husbands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAdulteryBadAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAdulteryBadAdultery">only do so because</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">their husbands were being mean to them</a>.

She never did anything remotely whorish though so it's more of a case of fans not knowing what other insult to chant at her ("Gold Digger" and "Manipulator" not exactly being easy for wrestling crowds to chant).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note60h6u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note60h6u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note60h6u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Also, there's the fact that "slut" and "gold digger" would be more applicable to Triple H, as Stephanie is the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> Chairman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and stands to inherit the company.

Her current boyfriend, Dolph Ziggler, is completely unperturbed about her romantic history and is very proud to be with AJ. Only CM Punk threw their relationship back in her face.

It all starts when a video of her making out with several boys at a Vortex Club party surfaces on the internet (the fact that anyone can clearly see she's under the influence of something while she's doing it doesn't mitigate anything). What makes it worse is that the students doing the "shaming" know for a fact she WAS drugged at the party and normally acts like the purest girl there is yet still think Kate brought everything on herself. The game also shows the negative consequences of the slutshaming: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kate is really depressed because of it and even manages to kill herself at the end of Episode 2 if the player doesn't make the right choices.</span>

</div></li><li> The asari race as a whole is subjected to this. They are an all female pansexual race that prefers to mate with members of other species and are open about their sexuality. Many asari maidens (young adults) even take jobs as strippers or dancers in bars for a few centuries, before settling down to raise children. This has created a galaxy-wide stereotype of the asari being promiscuous nymphomaniacs. The asari as a whole downplay this - except when it strategically suits them.

Then she goes to the doctor and finds out it's true.

<ul><li> Ginger in "Fast Reputation" grappled with the "damned if you do and damned if you don't" scenario, when she crashes a high school party to shed her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">"Nice</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuysFinishLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuysFinishLast">Girl"</a> image. She chats up with this high schooler, she crushes on for a bit under the table. And then he talked to Miranda and Courtney about her "pearly whites" and how dark it was, the two spiral it out of control to where Ginger encounters graffiti that all but calls her a slut (the cartoon instead uses the term "fast").
</li><li> To a lesser extent, the priggish and adult Joann tells Hoodsey that Carl (a preteen boy) that the latter is "a budding exhibitionist" all because the boy isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerShy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerShy">Shower Shy</a>.

Mystery Incorporated</a></em> had the puritan "ghost" of Hebediah Grimm, who attacked women with a giant mallet for their "painted faces, exposed necklines, and skirts that rise above the ankle!" It turned out Hebediah was being played by two teens who would "rescue" his victims, who they found hot for exactly the reasons Hebediah was attacking. This is probably why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Velma</a> was spared, despite her short skirt, with Grimm calling her a homely "model of purity."

Beavis frequently refers to his own mother as a slut, but he says it like he's proud of her!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Greg's cousin gets mad at him for having Steven when he wasn't married to his mother. The two were in a relationship for several years before they decided to have a child, but it wasn't like Greg and Rose could have likely gotten married anyway (what with Rose being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien">Starfish Alien</a>).
</li><li> Diane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em> experienced both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming">Virgin-Shaming</a> at the same time when she was called a "virgin slut" in high school.
