Apparently, Gin came across <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen's mooks</span> after they took a piece of his childhood friend Rangiku's soul. He wanted revenge. For over a hundred years, Gin waited for the perfect moment. The problem is, Gin never told <em>anyone</em> what his plan was, even Rangiku, possibly for fear of it getting back to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen</span> somehow or tipping him off. As part of his cover, Gin unquestioningly assisted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen</span> in his efforts for more power, and even fought or killed other people if they got in the way because in his view none of them had what it <em>really</em> took to kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen</span>. All of this backfires when he <em>finally</em> attacks, as the power he helped <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen</span> get, a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a>, saves Aizen from being killed instantly</span>.

This, of course, doesn't go over well with them.</span>
<ul><li> To be fair, some adaptations like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> and one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a> games, which provide scenarios where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she survives</span>, show how this would have happened anyway because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch still considers them too dangerous in general</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade">Death Parade</a></em>, in the afterlife, a man has the corrupt detective who didn't lift a finger to help his sister as she was being raped at his mercy and has the opportunity to torture him. Despite the Black-Haired Woman warning him that if he goes through with it, he'll be banished to the void and never see his sister again, he still does it.
</li><li> Sosuke Nekome, one of the main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DennouCoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DennouCoil">Dennou Coil</a></em>, is obsessed with ruining the MegaMass corporation for ruining his father's reputation and causing his death. He's willing to sacrifice anything and ultimately kill anyone who gets in the way of this plan, even the twelve-year-old protagonists Yasako and Isako. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately his little brother <em>does</em> possess reason and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel Face Turns</a> in the final episode</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Frieza never learns, much to Goku's annoyance.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Frieza could have chosen to escape, but he spends his remaining energy trying to kill Goku, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackstabBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackstabBackfire">backfires spectacularly</a>. This also crosses into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>; Frieza is so shocked that he was defeated by a Saiyan, whom he disregarded as "mere monkeys," that he can't accept that he is defeated even though he's missing an arm and the lower half of his body. Ever since then, his <em>entire purpose in life</em> is to get revenge on Goku for defeating and humiliating him; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>, he states outright that he can't stand to live in the same <em>universe</em> as Goku, and as long as Goku is still alive, he can't even sleep at night. But that's not all for Frieza.
</li><li> Immediately after becoming Mecha-Frieza, he wasn't even off the operating table before ordering his father and their men to set course for Earth, wanting revenge on Goku so badly that he overrides his father's plan to just blow up the planet from orbit and lands so he could personally kill all of Goku's loved ones and friends... and gets sliced into itty bitty pieces by Future Trunks, another Super Saiyan, for the trouble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, during the Super 17 Saga, instead of escaping Hell with the other villains, he and Cell stay behind to double-team Goku after Gero and Myuu trap him in Hell with them, only for Goku to effortlessly beat them both without even going Super Saiyan.
</li><li> This is the basis for his entire plan after being resurrected in <em>Resurrection 'F</em>'. He could have simply rebuilt his empire in space with the Z Fighters none the wiser, but he instead goes through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to unlock a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> before launching a full-scale invasion of Earth, all to get revenge on Goku for his previous defeat. It's to the extent that when one of his minions begs him to just leave Goku alone and focus on rebuilding his empire, Frieza either kills him on the spot or uses him as as a living punching bag for the next four months (depending on the adaptation). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This ends up being his undoing: Freeza rushed to Earth to get revenge as soon as he achieved his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>, not realizing its massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> (it burns through his stamina at an incredible rate). Even though he was technically more powerful than Goku or Vegeta (AND actually manages to mortally wound Goku), he can't seal the deal before he runs out of stamina and drops back to a weaker form, leaving him easy pickings for Vegeta.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Goku himself falls into this after becoming a Super Saiyan the first time. He wanted to make Frieza pay for killing Krillin. To that end, he let Frieza power-up to his max level for the sole purpose of humiliating him with the knowledge that even at his best he couldn't beat a "mere monkey". This was around the time when the planet was going to blow up in a few minutes so defeating Frieza as fast as possible would have been reasonable. He also refused to leave when King Kai planned to wish everyone to Earth, because he wanted to finish the fight. By that point, King Kai considered Goku a lost cause.
</li><li> Vegeta falls into this trope not once, but twice:
<ul><li> After Cell kills Trunks during the Cell Games, Vegeta, having had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a> over his treatment of the latter, snaps and attacks Cell at full force; said attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">doesn't even faze Cell</a>, and Gohan suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a> as a result <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a> for Vegeta. Since Gohan could still have beaten Cell before then, and since Trunks could still be revived by the Dragon Balls, it falls under this, with the other Z Fighters flat-out calling Vegeta an idiot.

Goku was more than cordial about it when he won, didn't even gloat, even complimented Zamasu's efforts and tried to help him up.

Granted Zamasu was never right in the head to begin with being that he saw all humans as chronically evil and that they need to be destroyed and, deeming himself a divine being just because he was a kai (Not even that, but a kai <em>apprentice</em>) to the point of zealotry (Kais just monitor their respective universes and the mortal races on planets, seeing if they can evolve to higher functions and be worth keeping around. If not, they get their Destruction Gods to wipe them out, that's it). But he personally made an effort to target Goku, again, just for a loss in a sparring match rather then being sensible and use the experience to better himself.

When Sasuke learns his (now late) older brother did everything he did for <em>Sasuke's</em> sake, he sets out on a <em>whole new</em> rampage of revenge, this one directed at the Leaf Village itself and the current aspirant for Hokage (Danzo) in particular. You know it's bad when Danzo, not exactly a saint himself, calls him on it and has a valid point. Gets even worse when he abandons his new team because he's too impatient to wait for them to catch up, and stabs through Karin simply because Danzo took her hostage and it was too much effort on his part to help her.

</li></ul></li><li> There's also Pain, who lost so many loved ones to ninja society that he set about to effectively destroy it so thoroughly people would be too scared to even <em>consider</em> making war. When that fear wore off, as Pain was certain it would, he would lather, rinse, repeat.
<ul><li> It should also be noted that the cornerstone of Pain's beliefs and plan is that he thinks <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">everyone acts like this</a></em>.

</li><li> Izuna Uchiha uses his dying breath to convince his brother, Madara, to refuse Hashirama Senju's offer of a truce in favor of continuing to avenge their fellow Uchiha.

</li></ul></li><li> The defining trait of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> villain Hody Jones. Despite having never suffered from it firsthand, he craves revenge against the human race for crimes against Fishmen and Merfolk and will do anything to achieve it. This anything includes sabotaging attempts by other characters to reconcile and live peacefully with humans so they can continue to justify themselves.
<ul><li> Arlong likewise shares this mentality largely due to the fact his mentor, Fisher Tiger, was killed by humans. Thing is though it was by Marines, Fisher <em>was</em> a pirate, and even as he laid dying, tried to impart to his crew not to let their hatred lead them to his fate (long story, but after he was mortally wounded, a blood transfusion could've saved him but Fisher refused because it was human blood and his hatred wouldn't let him take it). This wisdom fell on deaf ears when it came to Arlong and he decided to take revenge on humanity by enslaving as many as he could and building an empire from it...by going to the the more peaceful of the four seas, East Blue, and taking over an island of residence who likely don't even know much about fishmen let alone would abuse them.

He decides to go with the former, sending the Blackrock Clan, constituting a full third of the Horde's strength, to obliterate the two renegade clans. With the Alliance army approaching, Orgrim has to cut and run, retreating to his fortress in Blackrock Spire. Meanwhile, the Blackrock Clan clashes with the Twilight's Hammer Clan and slaughters them all, although sustaining plenty of casualties, while the Shadowmoon Clan is destroyed by the demonic guardians of the Tomb. On the way back to the mainland, the orc transport ships are ambushed by the Kul Tiras fleet commanded by Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, and most of the transports are sunk.

</li><li> Rickard Karstark wants to execute Jaime even though he's a valuable hostage. He's even aware that it doesn't make sense, but his love for his sons ran deep. After being robbed of any hope of seeing Jaime dead by Catelyn Stark he more or less goes off the deep end, savagely murdering two young Lannister squires who had no involvement at all in the death of his sons, simply because they shared the same blood as Jaime.
</li><li> Harald Karstark tries to convince the Boltons that they should kill Jon Snow because he still represents a Stark threat looming over their domain and because he wants to avenge his father, never mind that Jon's position as Lord Commander to the Night's Watch means he is required to forsake any lands and titles and also trying to target the Night's Watch would quickly earn the enmity of all other Northern houses. Roose refuses to pursue this idea which leads to Harald becoming an accomplice by inaction to Roose's murder, letting Ramsay kill him so he can take his place and go through their plan to march into Castle Black.
</li><li> Cersei Lannister tends to focus on harming her  real or imaginary  enemies, and think about the consequences... uh, sometime later. Maybe. A shining example is her ploy to undermine the Tyrells in Season 5. Not only does Cersei's claim to power rely on the Lannister-Tyrell alliance (meaning that, if the Tyrells are undermined, <em>she</em> is undermined), Cersei's scheme directly results in her own imprisonment, public humiliation, and complete loss of political power and control. Most halfway intelligent people would realize they've lost and do their best to mitigate the damage and avoid future misery. Cersei is not one of these people, and actually proceeds to she tops herself in Season 6's finale when she blows up the Sept of Baelor during the Green Trial, destroying all of her opponents in Kings Landing, along with a good part of the city. It's one of the very few plans she actually executes successfully, but it leaves her as <em>the</em> target of pretty much every remaining faction in Westeros. Of course, by that time her sanity is so long gone it's hard to even speak of "reason". And this time she may have been genuinely more interested in just making her enemies suffer than in gaining anything for herself. Another perfect example is also her willingness to have Sansa dead because she suspects that the latter poisoned Joffrey (she didn't). But she does not take it into consideration one bit that Joffrey caused many misfortunes to Sansa such as the execution of her father as well wanting to give her the head of her brother.
</li><li> Beating out even Cersei is Ellaria Sand, a woman who, in her determination to avenge the death of her lover Oberyn Martell, directs her vengeful fury at the only Lannister within her reach — Myrcella Baratheon, who is not only a child but also an innocent who had no involvement at all in Oberyn's death. Neither this nor Oberyn's own vehement insistence in life that "we don't hurt little girls in Dorne" is enough to stop Ellaria from remorselessly poisoning her. Not content to (dis)honor Oberyn's memory by murdering an innocent child, Ellaria takes it a step further in the next season by <em>snuffing out her lover's house entirely</em>, murdering his brother Doran and nephew Trystane which causes the legal extinction of House Martell.
</li><li> Mossador kills an imprisoned member of the Sons of the Harpy, despite the possible ramifications for both Dany's rule and himself. It should be noted that unlike <em>all</em> the aforementioned examples, Mossador is a slave rather than a noble and has little if any understanding of politics (he sees only that Dany is in a position where she cannot kill the captured Harpy, and doesn't understand <em>why</em> that is the case), but he still falls under this for, like Rickard Karstark above, putting his liege lord in a catch-22 that forces her to have him executed.
</li><li> Even the mention of the Targaryens can drive Robert into a frothing rage. While there are pragmatic reasons to send assassins after Daenerys, he does not care about them and just wants to see her family exterminated. This is presumably the reason why Ned Stark hid and protected his nephew Jon Snow, the son of Ned's sister Lyanna and Rhaegar Targaryen in Winterfell, passing him off as his illegitimate son.
</li><li> Balon passes up a golden opportunity not only to become a King of the Iron Islands again and gain complete independence for his people, <em>and</em> to become both fabulously wealthy and feared throughout all of Westeros by joining forces with the North solely for the sake of getting back at the family that was <em>part</em> of the force that put down his rebellion. This was even worse in the books, where Ned literally had nothing to do with the deaths of his sons. One of them died in a collapsing tower and the other in a battle he wasn't even present in.

They are determined to avenge every slight, and never, ever forgive. And just to make sure they don't forget either, their king has a giant book called the Book of Grudges in which he writes them all down in blood. They're currently going slowly extinct, and a fair amount of the blame goes to their refusal to cooperate with the other races because at some point in centuries past they were wronged by them. That, and their literal inability to stop taking revenge. Every time they take revenge, and lose a dwarf doing it? Write it down in the book. Vengeance is a <em>sacrament</em> to them; one wonders what they'd do once the Book of Grudges no longer had any unfulfilled grudges within.
<ul><li> To add some perspective on just how obsessive dwarfs are on the subject: A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf">White Dwarf</a></em> article (later added in the 8th edition armybook) described how Dwarf craftsmen were once hired to build a castle for the elector count of Ostermark, but the agreed-upon payment was <em>two and a half pennies short</em>. Outraged at being cheated, the dwarfs raised a throng and razed the castle to the ground at massive cost to their own in both lives and gold.
</li><li> Similarly, the Dwarfs took massive losses fighting the Greenskins at the Battle of Grimspike Pass, after an Ork Shaman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">exploded</a> causing a massive landslide. The Dwarfs wanted revenge, but since the offending Greenskin was dead, and the Dwarfs already had vowed to exterminate all Greenskins for other reasons, they declared a grudge against <em>Grimspike Pass</em>, broke own the surrounding mountains and used the rocks to fill up the pass.
</li><li> The Tomb Kings are nearly as bad when it comes to graverobbers. It doesn't matter how trivial the value actually held by an item stolen from their crypt, it's the insult inherent to the act that will make them chase the perpetrator to the ends of the earth with their undead armies. In fact they've been locked in a back-and-forth with the Dwarfs for some time over a Dawrfen pickaxe with a single Khemrian coin embedded in it. The Tomb Kings want the coin back, the Dwarfs declare a grudge every time the pickaxe is stolen, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> is born.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters">Trollhunters</a></em>: The Goblins will swear revenge anyone killing their own. The problem is that they have no concept of logical cause-and-effect about who is culpable in their vendettas. For instance, when one Goblin was run over by a human's truck, they don't attack the driver, but destroy the truck itself instead. In addition, one of the major characters, Claire, is targeted when a Goblin is killed and its remains had her photograph in the mess, which the Goblins don't understand is no evidence that she had anything to do with it.
</li><li> Quite a few incarnations of the Shredder suffer from this:
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>, Shredder's obsession with destroying the Turtles was often the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> for his and Krang's attempts to conquer the Earth. In one episode, the villains trap the Turtles in Dimension X, paving the way for an easy conquest. However, the Turtles provoke the Shredder into letting them out so he can fight them head-on by pointing out that he had never personally defeated them.
<ul><li> Lord Dregg, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the final two seasons, falls into this too by the last episode, being more concerned with destroying the Turtles as payback for them ruining numerous plans of his than his plans for world domination.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em> animated movie, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">2003 Shredder</a>, after being beaten so many times by his Turtles and discovering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a>, decides to go to the source (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage">Mirage comics universe</a>) and destroy all reality. Karai even explicitly tells him that this would kill him as well, but he's so obsessed with his revenge that he <em>just doesn't care</em>. This turns her against him permanently. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even the 1987 Shredder decides to put</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">self-preservation above revenge</a>.

Splinter calls him out on this during the first season finale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat">pointing out that when Splinter dies, Shredder will have nothing</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the third season finale, during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> scenario to stop the entire Earth from being destroyed, Shredder literally stabs Splinter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a> at a crucial moment, killing him and dooming the planet.

</li><li> Arcee's obsession with Airachnid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> is made of this, since the latter was the one who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killed her partner Tailgate</span>. This also applies with Starscream after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she finds out he was the one who killed Cliffjumper</span>. Fortunately by the end of "Partners", she was able to put her desire for revenge behind her. As of <em>Crossfire</em>, she swerved right back into it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner">Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner</a></em>: After a certain point, it becomes clear that Wile E. Coyote is really motivated more by this trope than by his ostensible motivations of desire for food. Many of his traps would kill the roadrunner in ways that would render the corpse totally inedible, but Coyote has come to care more about seeing the roadrunner dead than feeding himself or not getting maimed constantly on account of the Roadrunner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality-warping powers</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Earth fairies were so caught up in revenge against the Wizards of the Black Circle and the people of Earth that they were about to freeze Earth over when one of their grievances was that humans had not taken care of Earth. Nebula in particular wanted vengeance even when Morgana and the other Earth fairies had given up on it.</span> Thankfully, they were all convinced to drop it.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Some academics have argued that this trope may have a basis in evolutionary psychology. Simply put, disproportionate retribution might be a means by which we deter others from screwing us over, because a person who only ever sought revenge when the positives outweighed the negatives would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">a frequent target of manipulation and be constantly cheated</a> by strangers and even their fellow tribesmen. In other words, it sends a message to everyone else that: "if you screw with me, I'll do something far worse to you." This of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">does not mean</a> that such behavior <em>should</em> be considered acceptable, but it does explain <em>why</em> many people are prone to overreacting when they feel as though they have been wronged by someone else.
</li><li> This is, unfortunately, the attitude a lot of people have towards criminals: rather than having prisons seek to redeem them, they just want to satisfy their desire for revenge. This tends to just make things worse, as if, say, a robber isn't convinced to change his ways, he will likely just keep robbing people and remain a danger once he gets out.
