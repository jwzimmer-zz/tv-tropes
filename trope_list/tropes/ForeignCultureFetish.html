<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS">Blend-S</a></em>:
<ul><li> Main character Maika Sakuranomiya is obsessed with <em>anything</em> that isn't Japanese, to the point where her first childhood crush was...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KentuckyFriedChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KentuckyFriedChicken">Colonel Sanders</a></em> of all people. This motivates her to find a job at Stile in the first place—she wants the money to study abroad. This likely has something to do with the fact that she comes from a very traditionally Japanese family.
</li><li> Her manager, the Italian Dino, also holds this towards Japan, hence him moving there in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CatPlanetCuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CatPlanetCuties">Cat Planet Cuties</a></em>: The series as a whole is massively pro-American, both in pop culture references and story structure, on account of the author being a giant <a class="urllink" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=westaboo">westaboo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Nearly every episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen">Cold Open</a> is a parody of a famous western series, and all the main characters' restaurant of choice is A&amp;W "All American Food<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradeSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradeSnark">©</a>". To put this into perspective, when was the last time any of you American readers even <em>saw</em> an A&amp;W?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiniroMosaic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiniroMosaic">Kiniro Mosaic</a></em>: The two leads, Alice and Shinobu, both have a fetish for each other's cultures, which ties into their friendship. Shinobu did a homestay at Alice's home in Britain because she loves Western culture so much, and Alice then moves to Japan both to be with Shinobu and experience Japanese culture. The main difference between them is that Alice studied Japanese so much that she can speak the language fluently and knows more about the culture than many real Japanese people, whereas Shinobu can only say "hello" and nothing else and has only superficial knowledge about the English culture despite having lived in the United Kingdom for a while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Chojiro Sasakibe is a Japanese man obsessed with Western culture, mostly England. For example, he prefers English style tea to Japanese style tea, and his Shikai makes his Zanpakuto change from a katana to a rapier. It's one of the things he's always at odds with Commander Yamamoto about.
</li><li> It goes both ways for many of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LapisReLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LapisReLights">Lapis Re:LiGHTs</a></em>. Characters from the West Europe-inspired Waleland and Dortdgard are enamored with the culture of the Japan-inspired Yamato and many transfer students from Yamato are just as taken with theirs.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em>, the demons developed a vogue for 18th-19th century England (can't remember the period exactly) and were extremely pleased to have a soul from that era teach them how to best immerse themselves in it. It's implied that this obsessing over other cultures is pretty much all that the high ranking demons do anymore.

The Roman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> even jokes that if all Gauls were like him it's the Romans who would look Gaulic. Also note how everything in his home is a cobbled mix of Roman and barbarian elements.
</li><li> The same comic starts with a panel where a young Gaulic man gets his hair cut Roman style, while an older, long-haired Gaul looks on disapprovingly. Just like an old square from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> would when meeting a hippie (alternatively, a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">a collaborator</a>).

They always seem to hang around this era and place, and praise it a lot. Both the Fifth and Eighth Doctors have referred to themselves as either almost-English or honorary-English. Susan displays one too, getting very excited about whatever pop music is in the charts, and mentioning a lot how being in 20th Century England has been the best time in her life.

</li><li> The Third Doctor seems to particularly like Venusian culture; a master of Venusian lullabies, Venusian hopscotch and Venusian aikido.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor visually looks like a much older man than the more recent incarnations that proceeded him, and hes as crotchety as that sounds. Only, not like your average old man, because hes usually dressing like an alt high schooler, with a love of hoodies and generally comfortable but low-contrast dark clothing as much as he loves loud guitars and sunglasses. Basically, a 2010s alt teen in the body of an old man.

He also remarks that it was somewhat in vogue amongst young Roman men. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Even two thousand years ago, the older generation was rolling its eyes at the younger's adopting foreign ways.</a> It gets even funnier when you realize that he's basically describing the man-bun.
</li><li> The Romans and the Chinese never quite met, but they were vaguely aware of each other due to Silk Road intermediaries and had very positive impressions of each other. Chinese silk was so huge in the Roman Empire that the Roman name for China was "Seres", meaning "the place where silk comes from", and what little they knew of China they liked. The Chinese, for their part, considered Rome a rough Western equivalent of China, calling it <em>Daqin,</em> meaning <em>Great China</em>, and particularly loved Roman glass beads.
</li></ul></li><li> Rome had many admirers in the Ancient world for its organization and efficiency in administration, war and law including Greeks like Strabo and Polybius. So much so that the people of the East still clung to their identity as Romans after the fall of the original Latin part of the Empire.
</li><li> The Greeks themselves had a thing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and Phoenicia, borrowing their math, science, philosophy, religion, writing and some customs. Of the customs, probably the most significant is the Athenian City Dionysia — a state-supported festival involving plays, music, and wine for everyone — which was probably inspired by a similar Egyptian festival dedicated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Osiris</a> (both Dionysos and Osiris were fertility/agriculture-related gods dismembered, reassembled, and brought back to life). The Egyptian festival featured a reenactment of the Osiris dismemberment myth, and probably the first plays at the Dionysia were tellings of the equivalent tale of Dionysos; Dionysos was also associated with goats, and this story, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, was called <em>tragōidia</em> — "Song of the he-goat" — from which we get "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">Tragedy</a>". Both festivals also involved participants waggling sculpted phalluses in commemoration of the dismemberment (Osiris' member was replaced by a wooden one, as a fish ate it; Dionysos was of course a fertility god and also "the party god," so the association with phalluses came naturally).
<ul><li> The Greeks loved Egypt so much that eventually the Pharaoh set aside a city-sized chunk of land for them to build the colony of Naucratis on.
</li><li> Egypt itself was seized by Alexander and became Greek as time went on. It remained one of the bastion of Hellenism for centuries and its capital (one of the numerous Alexandrias, the only one that really endured under the name<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07o8z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07o8z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07o8z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The city of Kandahar, the second-largest city in Afghanistan, was <em>probably</em> another, but as you can see its name has changed quite a bit. The city of İskenderun in what is now the Hatay Province of Turkey has a closer name ("İskender" is the Turkish version of "Alexander", and also it was more usually known as "Alexandretta"—"Little Alexandria"—until the 1920s or 30s), but it is much smaller.</span>) was a beacon of civilization.
</li></ul></li><li> Many civilizations from South Asia, Central Asia, and the eastern Arab world have affinity for anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Persian</a>. The fact that the caliphate which had the most profound impact, the Abbasids, was founded by a Persianized Arab helped. The earliest Central Asian Muslim states were so obsessed with Persian culture, a great number of their indigenous people <em>became</em> Persians themselves.
<ul><li> This has mostly to do with the fact that Iran has been a great civilization since a long time ago (c. 600 BCE), so naturally most of its younger neighbors admire it. As noted by Sir Muhammad Iqbal, the comparison between Arabs and Persians can be likened to the Romans and Greeks: the Arabs gave the Muslims territory, the Persians gave them culture.
</li><li> The fetish actually dates back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>: Alexander the Great had a deep respect for Iran and considered himself successor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat">Cyrus the Great</a>. After he conquered the Achaemenids, he pursued the adoption of Persian customs in his empire, to the anger of his Greek advisers. The Seleucid part of his empire was <em>de facto</em> Iranian.
</li><li> For centuries, Persian was a sanctioned language of every Muslim dynasties in the region. It's often used in artistic works, hence why the great majority of poems from the Islamic Golden Age are written in Persian. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey">Ottoman Empire</a> still admired Iran even though its perennial archenemy was the Iranian dynasty of the Safavids. The Ottoman Turkish language is basically Persian with a few Turkish vocabulary sprinkled here and there. Even the Christian world has an example. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Armenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Armenia">Armenian</a> is so heavily influenced by Parthian (an extinct language in Northwest Iran), it was considered an Iranian language until the 20th century.
</li><li> The fetish continues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pakistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qaumi_Taranah">Its national anthem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is almost all in Persian and has only a single syllable that is exclusively Hindustani.
<ul><li> The national language of Pakistan, Urdu, also developed from a heavily persified version of Hindustani from the time of the Mughals.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Parts of Southeast Asia are heavily influenced by ancient and medieval Indian culture, to the point that some of them have Buddhism as their national religion. For example, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana">Ramayana</a></em> is a popular part of local folklore in various Southeast Asian cultures, from Thailand (where it is known as the <em>Ramakien</em>), to Indonesia (as the <em>Kakawin Ramayana</em>), to Cambodia (as the <em>Reamker</em>), to the Maranao people of the Philippines (as the <em>Maharadia Lawana</em>), to Myanmar (as the <em>Yama Zatdaw</em>); each version may have several differences from the original Indian version or each other.
</li><li> The Japanese adapted many of their cultural traits from the Chinese, most notably their writing systems (kanji literally means "Chinese characters"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jvzs');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0jvzs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jvzs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In a roundabout manner. It might be more precise to say "Han characters," as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">Han Dynasty</a>, but only because the dominant ethnic group of China—i.e. the people we think about when we think of China—call themselves the Han people, after the dynasty.</span>) and Chinese Buddhism, which was fused together with the indigenous Shinto religion.
<ul><li> Love of Japanese culture is oft mocked on the internet as "Weeabooism", from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> borne of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePerryBibleFellowship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePerryBibleFellowship">The Perry Bible Fellowship</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://pbfcomics.com/comics/weeaboo/">comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and an Imageboard word filter for "Japanophile." And it doesn't just refer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">particularly obsessive anime fans</a> ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccidentalOtaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccidentalOtaku">Occidental Otaku</a>"). Not even the ones who own a few too many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">katanas</a>. "Weeaboo" means a special brand of obsessive, crazy idiot who believes everything Japanese is superior, and wants to move to Japan and become a video game programmer/anime producer/manga artist/ninja/other hilariously improbable career. Enough of them actually accomplish the moving to Japan part, where their dreams are invariably crushed (with some <em><strong>very</strong></em> rare exceptions), to the point where the Japanese themselves have developed a stereotype about them. On a darker note, some of them become so obsessed with the idea of Japanese superiority that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">start supporting denials or sanitization of certain unsavory elements in Japan's past</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a lot of Japanese also have this for America and Britain, you will find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> of varying coherence on many things, sometimes to the point where it's used with no knowledge of meaning. Makes one wonder why people bash <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccidentalOtaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccidentalOtaku">weeaboos</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">many in Japan are just the same with Western societies</a>.
<ul><li> Japanese tourists in Paris often arrive with expectations not unlike a typical "weeaboo"'s reaction to real Tokyo without the mecha. This is so common that a psychological condition called "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">Paris Syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" has been coined that chiefly affects Japanese tourists, put down mainly to a combination of culture shock and the city of Paris not matching up to the tourists' idealized perception of it. They also develop perceptions of America based more on Hollywood movies than anything real.
</li><li> Many Japanese have a fascination for some aspects of French culture, such as food, fashion, and aesthetics. They often dump <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench">Gratuitous French</a> over the fronts of their stores. There are entire floors in some malls where all the shops have French names. The actual French find it hilarious, so much that they created a blog about it : <a class="urllink" href="http://lefranponais.fr/">http://lefranponais.fr/<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Subverted in the sense that there are a lot of Japanese niches, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LolitaFashion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LolitaFashion">Lolita Fashion</a>, that explore and experiment with styles and art forms from European history, such as Baroque or Victorian styles, much more than Westerners are interested in nowadays. Though often these do fall towards the fetishistic side — abuse of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> motifs, for one — a lot of art and design is created that, while based on Western forms, can only be found in Japan.
</li><li> Japanese money also props up a lot of European and American classical arts organizations (like museums, ballet) nowadays.
<ul><li> Japanese money goes toward ancient art as well, particularly Peru's famous Nazca Lines. There is a single research center in that area, which was built and is maintained solely by Japanese people.
</li></ul></li><li> They also borrowed a lot of political ideas from Germany and Prussia, as they were the dominant power when Japan was modernising — this is why their parliament is still called the Diet.
</li><li> During the Meiji period the government encouraged adoption of parts of Western culture/society and technology in hopes of "catching up" to the Western powers, both economically and militarily (to some factions, as a means to an end — being able to kick out the Westerners). However, while the government had a somewhat set idea for how to go about this — "Western technology, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSpirit">Japanese Spirit</a>" was the motto — some civilians and government/military officers alike would end up favoring particular, unintended aspects of the countries they went to or heard about.
</li></ul></li><li> Before modern times, Koreans were fond of all things China to the point of calling itself the "Small Middle Kingdom" compared to the Middle Kingdom that is China. These affections were generally only reserved for the Dynasties founded by Han Chinese, and the Conquest Dynasties like Yuan and Qing were viewed with contempt and accusations of savagery, which after some century of assimilation turned into a form of respect.
<ul><li> Modern day South Koreans have a thing for the United States (the country remains one of the USA's closest military allies), and a lot of them wish to visit the country and enjoy its culture. British culture also has its fans in the peninsula. Specifically, Koreans seem to really be into <em>Victorian England</em>, or at least a romanticized, idealized depiction of it, as well as high-society France at the time. A lot of bakeries popped up in response, with fancy-sounding exotic names like <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.tlj.co.kr/">Tous Les Jours<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">The High Middle Ages</a>, and again during the <em>Grand Siècle</em> (i.e. the 17th century) there was a French fashion, in which all true courtliness was done according to the manner of the French court and, if possible, in the French language.
<ul><li> Where Britain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">The High Middle Ages</a> are concerned, it might be <em>slightly</em> related to the fact that the entirety of the British nobility and upper-class was ethnically and culturally French. For other reasons (mainly being the most constituted nation of the bunch), same effects were experienced in Northern Spain, Northern Italy and Western Germany (notwithstanding that the whole West of the Holy Roman Empire was made of modern Eastern France at that time).
</li></ul></li><li> In the 18th century, there was a Turkish fad (some of you may remember it from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Amadeus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Amadeus">Amadeus</a></em>).
</li><li> The Renaissance went through a Greco-Roman fad, various facets of which repeated throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Notable instances include the Augustan fad of the 1730-1770 period, the Neoclassicism of the 1820s, and the Greek Revival of the 1880s. Romanticism began as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> against the Augustan period.
<ul><li> Giambattista Vico in his <em>The New Science</em> and more recently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DichterAndDenker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DichterAndDenker">German philosopher Oswald Spengler</a> stated that westerners essentially have this trope for the classical Greco-Roman civilization, which is more different from us than many of us think. Our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Theater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Theater">theater</a> actors don't wear buskins and masks, and there's usually no chorus either, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> looks too much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> to us, and our countries aren't governed by two consuls sharing the power, and there aren't annual elections for them either. Vico also pointed out that Ancient Romans had a moral system entirely alien to modern society (i.e. of the 1700s) and that the institutions founded by the Romans should be seen in context rather than copied wholesale to the present.
</li><li> British statesman Lord Chesterfield mentioned this in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LettersToHisSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LettersToHisSon">Letters to His Son</a></em>: "I was not without thoughts of wearing the 'toga virilis' of the Romans, instead of the vulgar and illiberal dress of the moderns" (letter 149)
</li><li> You'll notice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> took place during this time. Several of America's Founding Fathers, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, were fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a>. Note how the upper house of the U.S. Congress and of the states' legislatures are called "the Senate" and then there's the abundance of Greco-Roman architecture in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> and the state capitals. Also, part of the reason the bald eagle was chosen as the new country's symbol was apparently because the Romans had a thing about eagles. However, the Founding Fathers were not fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> and hoped that enough checks and balances would prevent the United States from emulating Rome's eventual slide into dictatorship.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> was quite fascinated by Ancient Rome as well, especially the Republican era. They also liked Sparta and Athens as a whole. Brutus, both the founder of the republic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade">and his notorious descendant</a>, were regarded as heroes and during Dechristianization, men were given names like Gracchus, Spartacus, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Marius</a>. A lot of the revolutionary costumes, most famously the Red Phrygian cap of the sans-culottes and other accessories was part of the classical revival as were some of the more <em>revealing</em> female fashion trends, the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses, during the Directory Period of France. One of the manifestations of this "classical revival" was the renaming of most "daughter-republics", i. e. the republics founded in territories occupied by the French armies, using geographic names from Roman times.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15tw1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15tw1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15tw1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands became the Batavian Republic, the Swiss Confederation for a time became the Helvetian Republic, while the conquest of Italy was followed by the establishment of, among others, the Cisalpine Republic (in Northern Italy), the Ligurian Republic (formerly the Republic of Genoa), the Roman Republic (the Church State), and the Parthenopaean Republic (formerly the Kingdom of Naples).</span>
</li><li> There's an old czarist tradition whereby Moscow is claimed as "the third Rome". The idea is that the center of the Christian church began in Rome and (if you're an Eastern Orthodox believer) moved to Constantinople ("the second Rome"). Then, after Constantinople fell to the Muslim Turks, the Eastern Orthodox Church moved its headquarters to Moscow ("the third Rome"). Thus, Russia claims itself as the spiritual successor to the Roman Empire by way of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a>, which was semi-justified as their imperial family has ties to the Byzantine ones. (Never mind that literally every other royal family of Europe can <em>also</em> trace ancestry to Byzantine emperors...)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27e26');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27e26" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27e26');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are several lines of descent, but the most prominent is through Irene Angelina, daughter of Emperor Isaac II Angelos and great-granddaughter of the great Alexios I Komnenos. Irene Angelina married the German prince Philip of Swabia, whose descendants married into every royal house in Christendom; all of today's European monarchs are descendants of Philip and Irene.</span> Obviously, this idea was out of favor under the atheistic Soviet Union, but it's seen a resurgence in Putin's Russia and has become a big part of Russian nationalist rhetoric.
</li><li> It's very common for Western powers to start viewing themselves as modern-day Roman Empires. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> saw his empire as a recreation of the Roman Empire and copied its symbols (such as the Eagle standard) for his armies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> got the Nazi salute from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenitoMussolini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenitoMussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, who got it from the Roman salute. Plus, in Hitler's view of history, the "First Reich" was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, which unsurprisingly claimed itself as a new version of the regular Roman Empire.
</li></ul></li><li> There were a number of Scottish fads in 19th century England. The first was the fad of the 1820s-30s kicked off by Sir Walter Scott (about which see elsewhere on this page); another fad was in the 1870s-80s, possibly triggered by how much time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">the Queen</a> spent there after Prince Albert died (Balmoral Castle had been Albert's personal project before his passing).
</li><li> After Napoleon's Battle of the Nile, there was an Egyptian fad, which was repeated in the 1920s after the discovery of King Tut's tomb. Napoleon's invasion led to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone which was later deciphered by the French Egyptologist Champollion. French interest in Egypt eventually led to an Obelisk from Luxor being purchased by the French government and then placed at the Place de la Concorde.
</li><li> Around late 1700s to the 1850s there was also a massive craze in Europe for Chinese-style (Chinoiserie) art and especially porcelain.
</li><li> Dano-Norwegian playwright <em>Ludvig Holberg</em> (18th century Denmark) nailed the trope in a little poem, roughly translated like this:
<div class="indent"><em>A man who wished to show he was learned <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleKnowLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleKnowLatin">Wrote only his letters in Latin</a>, <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsSexierInFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsSexierInFrench">Spoke french to his wife</a>, <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsMenacingInGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsMenacingInGerman">German to his dog</a>, <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassPeopleAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassPeopleAreMorons">and Danish to his servants</a>. </em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria">Ludwig II of Bavaria</a> had a thing for pre-Revolution era France.
</li><li> Ludwig's grandfather, Ludwig I, had a thing for Ancient Greece, which is why the German spelling of "Bavaria" was changed from <em>Baiern</em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">Bayern</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>'s son, Russian Emperor Pavel, was a great admirer of Prussia, just like his (probably<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3pxyz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3pxyz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3pxyz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Need we remind that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a> love life was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">legendary</a></em>?

This definitely didn't endear him to his population and especially his courtiers, especially given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">what a jerk he was about it</a>, and directly led to his assassination a couple years later.
<ul><li> As for Peter himself, he not only <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_III_of_Russia#Foreign_policy">had Russia change from being enemies to allies of Prussia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during the Seven Years' War, he also had a habit of wearing Prussian military uniforms to formal events. He blundered so badly in this that his wife, Catherine, was able to pull off a bloodless coup to oust him.
</li></ul></li><li> The USSR and the Soviet Union had a huge vogue in the 20s and 30s, and retained considerable prestige even in the 40s and 50s among several intellectuals in the Anglo-American world. The communists were also widely respected in the "Third World" until the 80s. This was related chiefly to the great intellectual respect commanded by Lenin, the creative explosion of Soviet Art in the 1920s (chiefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeiEisenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeiEisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBattleshipPotemkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBattleshipPotemkin">The Battleship Potemkin</a></em>), the memory of the Red Army's importance in winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and the launch of Sputnik.
<ul><li> African-American Communist Paul Robeson, in post WWII US, firmly believed everything was better in the USSR, including the treatment of minorities. Destalinization was a big blow to his reputation and prestige though he remained widely admired by the African-American community who, understandably, were far less partisan on the Cold War debate. Communism was in theory an anti-racist and anti-colonialist ideology, since it argued that class was the true root of all bigotry, and Stalin occasionally exploited this to score propaganda points <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ehb6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ehb6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ehb6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">via his invitation to all American Blacks to come to the USSR (though this was as much to shame the United States and show the USSR to be morally superior), and the Chinese Communists' "tractor women", who were women trained in a traditionally male field, using the tractor. It's also why there have been close ties to Communism and both America's Civil Rights Movement and Second Wave Feminism. Robeson was not acting on a cultural fetish so much as ideology and willful blindness. He extended this selective blindness to Mao in China.</span> On the plus side, he sang many Russian and Soviet songs in English, including <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtU3vUOa2sw">the Soviet State Anthem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> among others.
</li><li> Ironically by the time of the 50s and 60s, the USSR itself had lost considerable prestige among former allies. The Cubans, namely Che Guevara, felt that the Soviet Union was backsliding and becoming too comfortable for its own good. Destalinization alienated Mao Zedong in China, while the Vietnamese always saw their Communism as rooted in local and nationalistic interest rather than the international vision of the Soviets. By the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, Western intellectuals were more interested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CheGuevara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CheGuevara">Che Guevara</a> and Ho Chi Minh than Kruschev and other internal struggles. In France, during May '68, a number of young French leftists became fond of Mao and glorified the Cultural Revolution, much to their later regret.
</li><li> And at about the same time the USSR became an avid consumer of the works of communists living in capitalist/third world countries. Quite simply, the government enforcement of the "Socialist Realist" genre in all forms of artistic expression meant to genre had been more than played out by the time the sixties rolled around. The government thought that the works of foreign communist was close enough to propaganda and the people got a look at foreign cultures.
<ul><li> And during the eighties the Soviet populace could not get enough of American works and culture, newly available through Gorbachevs reforms. In hindsight, when an entire generation of Soviet teenagers started wearing jeans was when the Soviet Union was doomed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The French pirate Jean Lafitte was an enormous supporter of America and American patriotism, so much so that he ordered that his men attempt no sackings of American vessels when they came upon them. However, his patriotism did little to help the US government overlook his crimes, as even when he attempted to warn them that the British were planning an attack on one of their military outposts, they instead sent their troops to capture his base of operations. He was at least offered a pardon in exchange for his help in the final battle against the British in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> was very fond of French, Russian, and Classical Greek cultures, and considered them superior to his own German culture and based a fair amount of his philosophy on this. Towards the end of his (sane) life, he began to emphasize his Polish roots, to the point where he would sometimes deny that he was German at all and insist that he was entirely Polish. (As Poles were second-class citizens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">Imperial Germany</a>, he may have just been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">trying to annoy people</a>.)
<ul><li> Rather tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a> aside, he also had a deep appreciation for European Jewish philosophy and traditions though he likely would have balked at calling them a <em>foreign</em> culture.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few Estonians liked German culture in the late 19th century and tried to imitate it. They were called Juniper Germans (<em>Kadakasakslased</em>). This led to some odd things, like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kalevipoeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kalevipoeg">Kalevipoeg</a></em>—the Estonian national epic—being written by a fellow named Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald.
<ul><li> Similarly, north from Estonia, Finland also fell in love with Germany during the early stages of Finnish nationalism, to the point that the newly independent Finland was supposed to become a monarchy, with a German prince as the new king. The end of the First World War cut those plans short. This allegiance to Germany came back to play in the Second World War.
</li></ul></li><li> The British have had their own history of fads:
<ul><li> There's always been a love-hate relationship between England and France. Between the Norman Conquest and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a>, every English king spoke French as a first language and in court. Indeed the Hundred Years War broke out because the English felt that their claim to the French throne was being denied by French snobbishness (True). Even after, fluency in French was an expected mark of the nobility, gentry, and educated classes right up until the early 20th century, while dialects of French were widely spoken in Jersey and Guernsey well into the 20th century, both of which are still in use (to an extent, though monolingual 'Jerriais' speaking students were entering schools up to the early 1970s), and various forms of French are used in the UK's legal documentation and ceremonially in the Houses of Parliament. French writers and philosophers such as Montaigne, Descartes, Rousseau, Voltaire right until Sartre in the 20th century were highly influential on English writers and intellectuals and the English likewise tried to keep up with French fashion and trends (truth be told, they still do, they just don't like to admit it). Even now, French is the most widely spoken/understood language in the UK after English, with nearly a quarter of the population speaking/understanding it, and the default choice for a foreign language.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a> and the Romantic movement, the English had a huge crush on Italian culture, ancient and early-modern. Italian poets like Petrarch were translated into English by courtiers and the Petrarchan sonnet form greatly inspired the Elizabethan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a>. Many plays by Shakespeare, Marlowe and Webster were set in Italianate settings because the English public saw them as exotic and civilized. Latin writers like Seneca, Virgil and Ovid also inspired many dramatists of this generation, while Italian intellectuals like Giordano Bruno and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> were highly influential. During the Romantic movement, the likes of Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and John Keats spent years in Italy and Rome (both Keats and Shelley died in Italy) with their poetry having heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> for both the Roman and Renaissance eras.
</li><li> During the Romantic/Victorian era, the English public developed a fad for "regional" cultures such as Wales and Scotland, which was exploited by writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertBurns">Robert Burns</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterScott">Walter Scott</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertLouisStevenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertLouisStevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>. Historically this was still a raw period when Scotland only recently incorporated itself into Great Britain, and the memories of the Jacobite Rebellion were still fresh, so one can see this as a form of assimilation. It was during this time traditions about Scotland were "invented" (in historian Eric Hobsbawm's phrase) such as "tartan pattern" and the like. Walter Scott famously called Scotland "A costume and not a people" and essentially propagated all kinds of invented Scottish traditions that defined it in the imagination of English and European audiences. Ireland which refused to assimilate itself to Great Britain became a fad in the early 20th Century, thanks to its own writers: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce">James Joyce</a>, W. B. Yeats, Flann O'Brien and many others.
</li><li> As a result of colonialism, the English developed fads for the cultures of conquered lands, whether in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Africa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Africa">Africa</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australia</a>. Tropes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey">Mighty Whitey</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatWhiteHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatWhiteHunter">Great White Hunter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureArchaeologist">Adventure Archaeologist</a> date from the fiction of this era, chiefly the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HRiderHaggard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HRiderHaggard">H. Rider Haggard</a>. Later writers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephConrad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephConrad">Joseph Conrad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EMForster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EMForster">E. M. Forster</a> would deal with the same tropes in a more critical and darker light.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">Victorian Britain</a>, German romanticism was highly popular. The works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, Schiller, Lessing, as well as the music of Beethoven and Mozart were hugely popular and influential. Towards the late Victorian and early Edwardian period, the English literati and reading public also became fascinated by Russian literature and several authors like Ivan Turgenev, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoTolstoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoTolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FyodorDostoevsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FyodorDostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NikolaiGogol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NikolaiGogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntonChekhov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntonChekhov">Anton Chekhov</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a> became highly popular and influential.
</li><li> American culture was initially more popular in the Continent than within Britain. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> who was highly popular in America, got mileage out of making fun of American culture and society in his novel <em>Martin Chuzzlewit</em> and his <em>American Notes</em>. It was only at the end of the Victorian Age, thanks to the popularity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltWhitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltWhitman">Walt Whitman</a> (more liked in England than in America in this time), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, that the English finally admitted that they liked America after all. Even today, British people, even those critical of its politics, love America and couldn't live without the culture. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion">The British Invasion</a> was inspired by American rock and roll and Blues Music, and the Comics invasion of the 80s (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> and Co.) was also inspired by their love of American comics<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5i80e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5i80e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5i80e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Many rural areas in the UK have large shopping parks or malls, just like in America, except that the country is far smaller, and the British car culture, while not nearly as strong as America's (Britain's public transport network is too good for that) is still one of the strongest (if not <em>the</em> strongest) in Europe. Particularly relevant because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe">Cultural Cringe</a> - many Brits feel that they should be able to live in America as a result of the similarities between culture.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The United States, being a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeltingPot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeltingPot">Melting Pot</a>, has had a history of interest with all kinds of different European and Asian cultures.
<ul><li> The USA has its Anglophiles. Generally, they love British accents, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily">The British Royal Family</a>, and often focus on the Britain of an earlier time (usually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">Victorian Britain</a> through to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> or so). British TV shows, "Indie Rock" (more known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a>" stateside), classic British rock artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings">Lord of the Rings</a></em> and other fantasy fiction, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> are highly popular among millennials. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> is said to have been an Anglophile, which possibly explains why so many Disney films made during his lifetime were set in Britain and/or adapted from classic British literature.

One can trace this as far back as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s time as ambassadors in Paris, but in the early 20th Century, American writers, jazz musicians (white and black) would often go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris">Paris</a>. This led to the Lost Generation glorified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>. French stars like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBoyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBoyer">Charles Boyer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MauriceChevalier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MauriceChevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvesMontand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvesMontand">Yves Montand</a> were highly popular in America, as was later Brigitte Bardot. Many MGM musicals like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanInParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanInParis">An American in Paris</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigi">Gigi</a></em> are set in Paris. Among college intellectuals, Jean-Paul Sartre, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandBarthes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandBarthes">Roland Barthes</a>, Simone de Beauvoir, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertCamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertCamus">Albert Camus</a> and Michel Foucault were all the rage. Likewise the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood">New Hollywood</a> was described by its film-makers as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransAtlanticEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransAtlanticEquivalent">Transatlantic Equivalent</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchNewWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchNewWave">French New Wave</a>. As late as the eighties and nineties, US humanities departments tended to regard French philosophy as divinely inspired and inerrant, even as philosophy departments, dominated by analytic philosophy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">were less impressed</a>.
</li><li> The United States has always been fascinated by Asia, especially the Far East of China and Japan. The USA of course played a major role in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a>'s history, via the arrival of Commodore Perry's "black ships" and aspects of Japanese culture and media (particularly their films and manga) have been constantly invoked, either by singing its praises or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">emphasizing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">its</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt">negative</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">aspects</a> as well. In the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a>, Americans naturally confuse different eras of China, and China with Taiwan and Hong Kong, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsMovie">martial arts</a>, Chinese Food (or the local version thereof) and aspects of Chinese fashion and culture remain common reference points for America. As of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, South Korea has gotten in on the game, with Korean food, pop music, and K-Dramas finding a stateside audience.
</li></ul></li><li> Since the times of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a>, Russia has developed a French fad, being obsessed with their culture to the point that some of the nobles didn't even know how to speak Russian, opting to use French as their preferred language. This is described in detail in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em>, where Tolstoy included tons of untranslated French, and characters adored everything connected to France, such as Prince Andrei idolizing Napoleon. Of course, after the Napoleonic Wars this fad slowly faded away, with Russian conservatism deprecating French ideas of liberty which was more closely associated with revolutionaries, who idolized French Republican and Socialist ideas from the Decembrist Uprising to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a> (whose first anthems were modeled on <em>La marseillaise</em> and who placed a flag of the Paris Commune in the Kremlin). The USSR were generally on good terms on with French culture and French cinema.
</li><li> Australia has (had) a very strong Anglophile streak, lessening in the 1970s to be replaced by America, though that's more of a conflicted fandom. Australia itself was on the receiving end of this by Americans through the 80s with movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrocodileDundee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrocodileDundee">Crocodile Dundee</a></em> popularizing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeAussie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeAussie">Awesome Aussie</a> trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hungary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hungary">Hungary</a> had a hard-on for anything that was <em>not</em> Russian while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IronCurtain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IronCurtain">Iron Curtain</a> was up. Then, after 1989 the foreign stuff started pouring in, and throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> people were going crazy for literally <em>anything</em> that came from west of the border. This eventually led to the development of an ultra-nationalistic cultural (and political) movement around the turn of the millennium.
<ul><li> This is typical of most post-East Bloc countries in general, but Hungary's case is somewhat special in that under the so-called "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash_communism">goulash communism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" instated in the 1960s, the Hungarian economy was the most open to the West within the Bloc (which isn't saying much; even Yugoslavia—which had a similar economic system necessitating some trade controls but was neutral in the Cold War and thus not part of the Eastern Bloc—saw far more trade with the West than Hungary).
</li><li> Inn the Eastern Bloc in general, due to constant eonomic shortages and lower living standards, anything from the West (consumer goods, culture etc.) was seen as better, more durable and shinier.
</li></ul></li><li> A very touchy example was the glorification of all things Africa by black Americans (mostly in the early to mid-nineties), which was particularly odd as most of whom are <em>not</em> seen as "fellow Africans" by people currently living on that continent, but are rather viewed as simply Americans with a darker skin color.
<ul><li> Especially odd was the use of Swahili by such groups, as it is an East African language that none of the West African slaves would have understood or even heard of. They actually spoke a wide variety of tongues — Fon, Wolof, Yoruba, Ibo, Fula, etc., but virtually none would have spoken Swahili.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope also tends to occur whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy">white people</a> dare to turn a popular aspect of black culture into something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a>. Note the amount of rock acts in the late 90s/early 2000s that tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock">marry their genre with rap</a>, or cringe-worthy commercials where a "hip grandma" or culturally sensitive college kid would say things like "that's da bomb" or "that's tight" with a straight face.
</li><li> "Eastern" Spirituality in so many of its glorious forms is really a "western" imagination of something deemed excitingly exotic, peaceful and, well, "spiritual", and most of all, full of opportunities to escape one's dull life.
<ul><li> It doesn't help that the New Age movement (which is not exclusively Eastern) has gotten so tangled up with what the west considers Eastern mysticism.
</li><li> The mangled "Eastern" Spirituality can be detected in the differing views on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>: Westerners view it as a way to return to the world and have a better new life, whereas Easterners view it as a negative cycle that must be broken. There's a reason for this, as reincarnation isn't an "Eastern" concept as such: there <em>were</em> culturally Western faiths with a belief in reincarnation (for example, a Pythagorean mysticism) which indeed espoused such views.
</li><li> Additionally, most Westerners who accept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> do so because it fits their atheism/agnosticism and Scientific Rationalism. They tend to strip all the supernatural and ceremonial elements out of Buddhism and declare it a philosophy, or say it's something other than a religion. They view traditional Eastern practice of Buddhism as a perversion of Buddha's message, and that Asian cultures have been doing it all wrong. Go over to the discussion section of The Other Wiki's article on Buddhism, and you will see a 5+ year argument over the definition of Buddhism. Those who favor describing it as a religion tend to come from Asian cultures (they even cite their own language's wiki).
</li><li> The website Stuff White People Like <a class="urllink" href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/01/18/2-religions-that-their-parents-dont-belong-to/">notes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the Asian religions liked by Westerners are usually the opposite of what they grew up with and religions that don't have much restrictions (which is why Islam, which is not unlike Christianity in basic doctrine and morals, is not a common religion for Westerners to convert to).
</li><li> Christianity itself is a Middle Eastern religion which caught on with the Romans for, come to think of it, the same reasons today's Westerners buy into eastern spirituality.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> The bizarre Israeli-fetish found in some strains of American Christian fundamentalism, and the appropriation of Jewish symbolism found in some Christian groups, to the point where some Evangelical Christians celebrate Passover. It comes off as both philo-Semitic and antisemitic at the same time. Gets more than a little freaky when you find out a chunk of that fundamentalist population loves Israel because they think the unification of the Holy Land and the rebuilding of the Temple Mount are necessary for Christ to come again... and they don't really seem to care about what happens to the Jews after that.
<ul><li> This fetish also makes many of them as rabid as the most extreme right-wing Israelis (with the added bonus of being thousands of miles away from the practical results of their proposed policies) and blithely indifferent to what happens to the Palestinians. The real life complexities of the situation don't really interest them at all; whoever gets in the way of the Holy Land being under complete Israeli control is the enemy of God, to be crushed or swept aside without mercy. In this, they actually agree with the craziest of the crazy of Israel, the ultra-right-wing Religious Zionists, who tend to be Orthodox<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6vulj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6vulj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6vulj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <strong>not</strong> "ultra"-Orthodox as non-Israeli media would have you believe. Ultra-Orthodox refers to Jews that reject a (secular) Jewish state before the coming of the Messiah and are thus openly or tacitly anti-Zionist at best tolerating the existence of Israel, at worst making common cause with Ahmadinejad and the likes</span> Jews as well as far-right wingers politically aiming for the "redemption" of the Land of Israel: it's the same thing, it's just that the Jewish ones are hoping for an unknown Messiah, whereas the Christians think they know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">who</a> the Messiah is. As a result, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">said rabid right-wing Israelis consider them very valuable allies</a>.
<ul><li> All this, by the way, makes things very confusing for American neo-Nazis. Should they support the left-wing party (which contains more than a few Jews) or the pro-Israel party? The rest of the right doesn't care about their plight, of course, as the neo-Nazi movement is small enough to comfortably ignore. Some members of the alt-right, despite their virulent anti-Semitism, have expressed admiration for Israel as the kind of "ethnostate" with its policies favoring Jewish people that they would like to replicate with white people elsewhere.
</li></ul></li><li> The same thing essentially happened among the some parts of the Russian far right, who chose to throw away the intense, bitter Antisemitism that was a traditional trait of the movement, and instead come as downright Zionist. This is for somewhat different reasons, though, and has mostly to do with a shift of their object of hatred towards Muslims, perception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli">Israelis' "raghead bashing" prowess</a>, and a distaste towards Nazism which did a lot of horrifying things to their nation and peoples.
</li></ul></li><li> And on the other side, the more nutty sympathizers with Palestinian extremists (or Iran, or Israel's main enemy <em>du jour</em>) wear the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh">Kufiya<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> without knowing much of its background and call for "solidarity" with Hamas and other groups that — to say it politely — may not share all of their viewpoints. A Western Atheist calling for "support" or "solidarity" for Hamas one day and decrying homophobia and religious violence the next day may come off a bit strange, but then again Hamas cares just as little about <em>that</em> as the above-mentioned right wing Israelis care about the plans Christian Zionists have after the Messiah comes.
</li><li> There is a small, but obsessive, fanbase for Monaco, and its lavish culture. This can largely be attributed either to the reputation of the casinos of Monte Carlo or the fact that the country's most famous princess was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceKelly">Grace Kelly</a>.
</li><li> Related to both the Monaco and Israeli fandoms is the long-standing fetishization of "Arabia" and the Bedouin culture in American movie making (the adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSheik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSheik">The Sheik</a></em>, which starred a Mexican-descent actor as the lord of the burning sands, and the quasi-historic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> as only two examples). In more recent years, some political factions in the USA have gained a deep affinity for Arab and Muslim culture. This has taken a particular edge in the progressive support for the Palestinian side in the on-going conflict - a support that glosses over the significant differences between progressive and fundamentalist Palestinian approaches to homosexuality, women's liberation, and to a lesser degree protection of religious minorities and religious freedom<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7f5du');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7f5du" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7f5du');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Long story short: Palestinians are, as you might expect, quite conservative when it comes to sexual mores; though not as conservative as some of their neighbors (*cough* Saudi *cough*), they're still quite prudish when compared to some of their other neighbors, like the Israelis and Lebanese. Palestinians are generally OK with women working, and the Palestinian left is theoretically committed to equality, but Palestinian culture is still pretty heavily patriarchal. Finally, the degree to which minorities are to be accepted is something of a bone of contention among Palestinian groups: Fatah and the "left" tend to be full-throatedly accepting of freedom of religion (a large percentage of Palestinians <em>are</em> Christians, and many of the left-wing Palestinian groups, e.g. the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine—who are Communists, at least nominally—have historically had heavy Christian membership), while Hamas' position is more divided (generally advocating religious <em>toleration</em> in the context of an Islamic society), and many of the Islamist groups to the right of Hamas (e.g. Islamic Jihad) being even more suspicious of minorities (typically advocating that they be required to pay a <em>jizya</em>—a special tax symbolic of their recognition of Muslim rule).</span> among other issues. A closer correspondence to the Monaco fanbase is the new but increasing fanbase for Dubai, with its glittering towers and extreme opulence...based on a lot of exploitation of immigrants and truly abysmal human rights record, plus the glittering towers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a> writ large at best and at worst surprisingly tacky, and the whole thing is built on an economic model whose sustainability is subject to serious doubt, but <em>world's tallest building</em>, everyone!
</li><li> France has a whole has a history of fetishes and fads, befitting the historical centre of fashion and trends:
<ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a>, French intellectuals greatly admired England and later the United States of America for its political liberalism and scientific accomplishment. English words like "club" were imported wholesale to describe the emerging "Jacobin Club". When the Revolution broke out, and war with England was declared, this cooled considerably, especially later when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>, who <em>did</em> like English culture, declared a blockade on English goods.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire">Voltaire</a> believed in a "benevolent despot" system after visiting Prussia and becoming pen pals with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>, though he later expressed skepticism in private. His ideal government and favorite culture was England and its politically liberal tradition as well as the tradition of English satire of Pope and Swift which greatly inspired his own works. He greatly admired English scientists such as Isaac Newton for whom he was such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorshipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorshipper">Hero-Worshipper</a> that he sought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">to destroy Leibniz's reputation solely to elevate that of his hero.</a> That said, Voltaire hated Shakespeare whose violation of "classical unities" annoyed him greatly. Shakespeare would only be appreciated among Frenchmen from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo">Victor Hugo</a> onwards, the latter was one of the first French authors to violate "classical unities" and make that okay to do in France.
</li><li> In the age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>, anti-Bonaparte exiles like Madame de Stael and Benjamin Constant were among the first to discover German romanticism and write seriously about it. Among Bonapartists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Italy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Italy">Italy</a> was regarded with a great deal of fetish, aided undoubtedly by Napoleon's art theft of Renaissance painting and sculpture from Italy to the Louvre. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stendhal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stendhal">Stendhal</a> who served with Napoleon loved Italy so much that when Napoleon lost, he refused to enter France and spent the next ten years in Italy sulking and writing about Italian opera and culture. The famous "Stendhal Syndrome" was coined to describe his overwhelming love for Florence's Renaissance culture and his novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCharterhouseOfParma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCharterhouseOfParma">The Charterhouse of Parma</a></em> is a highly romantic portrayal of Italian culture.
</li><li> France has of course always been fascinated by America. American writers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville">Herman Melville</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> were for a while more popular in France than the United States, and French literary critics were among the first to take genre writers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DashiellHammett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DashiellHammett">Dashiell Hammett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaymondChandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaymondChandler">Raymond Chandler</a> seriously. Likewise, Jazz and Blues which were still seen prototypically as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">The New Rock &amp; Roll</a> in America had a popular and intellectual audience in France. American movies, especially the genre films of westerns, musicals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> (a French word as it happens) was first given serious attention by the French magazine Cahiers du Cinema who were the first to write seriously on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHawks">Howard Hawks</a> and many others.
</li><li> France has had a cultural obsession with Africa and Africans for going on a century now (it wanes in popularity every few decades and then comes back). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PabloPicasso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PabloPicasso">Pablo Picasso</a> (who was not French, but lived in France for a good portion of his life) famously represented it in a few of his paintings (many of those distorted faces are actually meant to be African tribal masks). They also greatly admired African-American culture, and Blues and Jazz musicians (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephineBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephineBaker">Josephine Baker</a>) is still a household name. The obsession came about through a combination of French colonialism and an influx of African American expatriates settling in Paris after each of the World Wars.
</li></ul></li><li> Brazil is a country with a cultural obsession of "mixing" with other nations — it's been a long held belief that Brazil's strength comes not from its racial purity, but from its propensity for mixing with as many races and cultures as possible, thus adopting their best traits into the larger Brazilian culture. There have been waves of cultural obsession, including Japanese, Arab, American, Portuguese, African, German, Italian, etc. At any given time in their history, the Brazilian intelligentsia has been obsessed with <em>some</em> nation's culture.
</li><li> (White) America has had a long standing fascination for Native American, even through their displacement. The Boston Tea Party protesters dressed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraidsBeadsAndBuckskins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraidsBeadsAndBuckskins">buckskins and feathers</a> as a symbol of their American identity. Many of them later joined the Improved Order of Red Men, a fraternal organization that still exists today.
<ul><li> It's not just whites who are into the fad; the "Mardi Gras Indians" are mostly black.
</li><li> In more modern times, playing "Cowboys and Indians" has been a long time kids favorite.
</li><li> Groups as diverse as people from the military (Mohawk hairstyles for paratroopers during WWII, tomahawks carried by American soldiers in pretty much every armed conflict they've been involved in to the point that it's arguably the US <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalWeapon">National Weapon</a>) and New age hippies (who seem to believe in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">Magical Native American</a> stereotype) seem to love wearing the culture. There's also the recent trend of feather headdresses as fashion accessories, "Indian Girl" tattoos, and "Navajo Print" flasks. This is much more likely to be a random melding of traits from a dozen different cultures spread over the continent than from one specific tribe as well, making it downright <em>confusing</em> to people with actual knowledge.
</li><li> Native American imagery is also a popular source for sports mascots due to the stereotype that Native Americans are tough and savage warriors.
</li></ul></li><li> Scandinavia and the Nordic countries get a lot of this. If it's not a general fascination with Vikings and such things, it is most probably admiration of the Nordic welfare system and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsceticAesthetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsceticAesthetic">"hygge" aesthetic</a>. In the 50s and 60s, Swedish movies, especially those of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngmarBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngmarBergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, were highly popular and successful in America and Europe. Music is also important, with some foreign Metalheads in particular, who seem to believe that the famous Black Metal and Death Metal scenes of Norway and Sweden respectively, are totally mainstream and played on pop radio. It isn't so—Remember that although Sweden produced half the forerunners of melodic death metal, it also produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>. And after ABBA, Sweden has never ceased being insanely successful at (and obsessed with) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, which has earned them a lot of admiration and envy.
</li><li> Argentina has had an obsession with France since the 19th Century, starting back in the time when the Argentinean bourgeoisie looked at France as the role model for the country they wanted to create. This becomes particularly clear when visiting Buenos Aires, as the architecture has an intensely French feel to it. Although the francophilia has dwindled through time (never quite dying out), the trend is still strong in the academic environment, mostly in the social sciences and humanities' colleges, which are overwhelmingly focused on French authors. Finally, as in Paris, psychoanalysis still thrives in Buenos Aires, particularly the Lacanian current.
</li><li> Latin America used to be in love with everything American for most of the 20th century, to the point of ignoring Hollywood's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCapitalOfBrazilIsBuenosAires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCapitalOfBrazilIsBuenosAires">peculiar vision</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLand">of its culture</a>. However, by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> era, the US' interventionism in domestic matters (leading to totalitarian regimes) led to this fascination to die down in favor of "Latin-Americanism". The only part of American culture still hugely popular down south is Hollywood's blockbuster movies. Nevertheless, other aspects of US culture are popular in Peru and Colombia, which don't hold such grudges against Americans.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8i6e1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8i6e1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8i6e1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The former had a very left-wing dictatorship in the 70s, while left-wing politics in the latter became discredited by the guerrilla.</span> In general, the US was seen as wholly positive and something worth emulating (as seen by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome">Ancient Grome</a> style of government buildings from that era inspired by the Grome-tastic US representative architecture) until at least the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericanWar">Mexican-American War</a> (which resulted in <em>huge</em> amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a> in leftist circles, especially in Mexico). While the US in general is more popular among right-wing Latin Americans than among the left wing, US popular culture and (for lack of a better term) the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanDream">American dream</a>" have been most popular in the <em>former Soviet satellites</em> of the Caribbean. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nicaragua" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> turned into a Communist nation in the 1980s, Russian TV and books were not nearly as popular as US cowboy fare, even if they (understandably) disliked American foreign policy, as pointed out <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1xrAv9cMqI">at the time by the mayor of a Vermont town<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kiq6');"><sup>explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kiq6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kiq6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The town in question is Burlington, and the name of the Mayor is of course Bernie Sanders</span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em> is <em>still</em> shown on Nicaraguan TV in the 2010s. And the <em>Communist</em> Cuban public of all places still prefer classic American cars dating from the 1950s to more recent Soviet (and later Japanese and Korean) ones.
<ul><li> Latin Americans had also a strong admiration of Italian culture during the 20th century, particularly between the 1950s and 1980s, either because of its cars, its music, or its softcore comedies.
</li></ul></li><li> Celtic cultures, and particularly the Irish culture, have their numerous admirers, too - be it for the richness of those cultures, their fascinating histories or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> ways when dealing with the Brits. Just one very telling example: Russia, of all places, has a ton of bands playing <em>Celtic</em>(ish) folk music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> has a significant following worldwide amongst white supremacists and anti-Semites. Of course, it's only this trope for the neo-Nazis who aren't German.
<ul><li> There's also a weird "Nazi chic" trend in some Asian countries, which is based on the aesthetics of the regime rather than its vile ideology <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9uce2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9uce2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9uce2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Japan and China both have Holocaust museums that are regularly visited by locals, and many are aware of the genocide.</span>. Hence, there are <a class="urllink" href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-rice-bowl/chinese-lovebirds-nazi-garb">Nazi-themed weddings in China<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Its history goes back a long way. Both China and Japan had close relations with Germany since late 19th century. Nazi Germany was an ally of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Guomindang China</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> in the 1930s, providing military aid to the former and diplomats to the latter. Although China got thrown under the bus by Hitler, it should be noted that the GMD's army still wore German-influenced uniforms until the 1950s, and used Stahlhelms for parade duty until 1946.
</li><li> Nazi Germany and its aesthetic have a huge vogue in some parts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a>. Some of this can be traced to Subhash Chandra Bose and his Indian National Army's poorly concieved attempt to ally with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">The British Empire</a>. Others mostly see Hitler's pan-Germanic majoritarian ideology as a precedent for right-wing Hindu movements in India. The weird part comes with the Hindutva ideology which took inspiration from both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Nazi Germany</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">and</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Israeli Zionism</a>. And even without the political connotations, the swastika is still considered as a positive symbol in India for ages, its Nazi version not excepted.
</li><li> There's also something similar to the above two examples happening in America, where people get attracted to the aesthetics of Imperial Germany. This is considered by some to be a subtle "cover" for Neo-Nazis who want to express pro-German viewpoints and aesthetics publicly but without backlash, as Imperial Germany isn't nearly as vilified by history. However, not all people who are interested in Imperial Germany are Neo-Nazis, and many fittingly hate the Nazis for having brought down Germany. Even still, the fascination for all things German -including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfVillainy">spiked Pickelhaube helmet</a>- tends to worry some people considering how close it comes to outright Nazi worship, or at least German nationalism. There are also some Westerners who adopt the aesthetics of the Nazi regime, even if they disavow its politics. The similarities between these people and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccidentalOtaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccidentalOtaku">Occidental Otaku</a> have given rise to the term "Wehraboo", which has a similarly negative connotation like "Weaboo" does. And much like with Weaboos, this fascination is not shared with the local population. Anyone going to Germany with a nationalistic mindset will be... disappointed at best, considering nationalism is very taboo in modern Germany. Admirers of Imperial Germany who aren't neo-nazis tend to prefer the term "Kaiserboo", as it refers to the emperor of Imoerial Germany.
</li></ul></li><li> White America seems to love anything related to India (and, by extension, Pakistan, even if they don't realize it), particularly for its "exotic" appeal. While the White American appreciation for Indian cuisine is considered largely benign, and Indians are generally accepting of Western appreciation of secular Indian music and dance (bhangra it up, bro, if you've got the moves!), things start to get dicier when it comes to "exotic" Indian visual arts, clothing, body decoration, and religious iconography. This is especially common during the Coachella festival when white girls always get bindis and henna and are complimented on how "cute" they look, even though Indian girls have been mocked by white people for trying to wear their own cultural items. What makes it even more frustrating is that the bindi and henna have significant meanings in Indian culture (with the bindi in particular having spiritual meaning in Hinduism, and henna being a festive tradition across religions in the Indian subcontinent — and elsewhere, henna being popular across the Muslim world and in Southeast Asia), but it's reduced to a fashion statement to be "exotic" and "spiritual". Even more infuriating for Hindus is seeing photos of hipsters smoking weed in front of pictures of deities such as Ganesha. Celebrities who have caused significant anger among Indian communities for appropriating the bindi and henna include Iggy Azalea, Selena Gomez, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Miley Cyrus, and Madonna. This has even led to movements called #ReclaimtheBindi and #CoachellaShutDown among Indian and Pakistani girls, who celebrate their heritage and shut down white people appropriating their cultures.
