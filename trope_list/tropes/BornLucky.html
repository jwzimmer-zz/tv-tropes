They'll win every contest or lottery they enter (in especially extreme cases, they don't even need to, the winning ticket will somehow come to them). Usually a weak explanation is given for this luck, attributing it to some kind of supernatural force but not going into any kind of detail. Despite the trope title, this luck does not necessarily begin at birth.

</p><p>The extent of this luck can vary greatly; sometimes the lucky individual has to be careful with taking advantage of it, lest it run out at the worst possible time. Other times it applies all the time and can get a little ridiculous.

He was born with an incredible amount of magical power as well as talent for magic, learning advanced techniques not long after he joins the Golden Dawn. He luckily finds a scroll containing the power of Sylph, allowing him to finally defeat Mars. His team later goes on to place first in the Magic Knights Examination by the luck of Rill accidentally destroying his team's crystal. When the elves are reincarnated, the soul reincarnated into his body is an unborn's child, allowing him to regain control of his body. He's so used to things going right that he <em>hates</em> losing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, Faye Valentine's debut episode set her up to look like this. A casino hires her, claiming she's this ancient lady-luck figure who can win every game she's ever played and never cheated. "She was just a born winner." It appears for a while Faye is indeed the woman they speak of, as when she works the blackjack table, she takes everyone's cash almost effortlessly, even robbing our hero Spike of every chip (save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">one</a>). Then Spike nonchalantly points out that she was cheating. As the series goes on, we see Faye is anything but lucky.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ran Mouri has <em>absurdly</em> good fortunes playing luck-based games like Poker or Mahjong. First seen when she goes into a mahjong parlor where her father Kogoro is gambling, very upset because he took Conan with him... then she gets interested in the game itself... and in the next scene she has fleeced her dad <em>and his companions</em> out of all their "prizes". (And then the owner of said parlor, who doubled as a loan shark, appears dead...)
</li><li> Another case started with her aiming to win the <em>second</em> prize in a raffle, which was a family trip to the beach. Conan was all "I don't think you'll win"... Cue to the next panel, with Ran happily telling Kogoro about the trip she won and a terrified-looking Conan next to her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> gives us Cell and Majin Buu, who reach their ultimate forms as much because of their own cleverness and guile as because many of the heroes make either overemotional or at times plain <em>stupid</em> decisions while trying to destroy them.
</li><li> Katsuhiko Jinnai from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld">El Hazard</a></em>. He lands in an alien world and <em>immediately</em> becomes ruler of a powerful nation with millions of slavishly-loyal and murderous servants (not to mention the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">not-unattractive Queen</a>). For no reason other than <em>dumb luck</em>. Ironically enough, Jinnai sees Makoto as this.
<ul><li> It is important to note, however, that while dumb luck may have been what gave Jinnai power, it was his tactical genius that (at least in the first OVA series) allowed him to <em>continue</em> being successful as a villain. The Bugrom had been attacking other countries for centuries after all. They had little, if any, success until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">Jinnai</a> began leading them. Once he did, he made conquest after conquest, coming very close to taking over El-Hazard. He most likely would have succeeded were it not for the heroes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice">Plot Device</a> superweapon.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em>, a man on death row who defied multiple attempts to execute him is posited to be just that "fortunate". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ultimately, though, he dies when struck by lightning, as each time he evaded death made it that much more likely for him to be killed by improbable means.</span>
</li><li> Millefeuille Sakuraba of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> has this as her defining trait. In the second episode, a <em>meteor</em> smashed the casino she was playing in to give her the win. That's just one of many instances of her extreme luck. This was later balanced by a recurring and plot-convenient Conservation of Luck.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel">the games</a>, Millefeuille's luck isn't <em>quite</em> so outrageous, but even though the anime exaggerates everything to incredible proportions, it's still pretty close; such as winning the grand prize in a supermarket sweepstakes SIX TIMES IN A ROW. At the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">her path</a> in the first game, she retires from the Angels, believing that she's used up all her luck... but it and she are back for the next one.
<ul><li> Her luck goes both ways in the game. If she's lucky, she's unbelievably lucky, when something involving bad luck happens, it happens in a spectacularly bad way.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The lead character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ION" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ION">ION</a></em>. She has known a jinx since she was little that when you say it, you land in a fortunate situation. She uses it often.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>: Justy Ueki Tylor is a lazy, incompetent, bumbling idiot, and as the name might suggest, he is the most irresponsible man to ever hold the rank of "Captain." He also happens to be the luckiest man alive. He gets out of near-impossible situations by nothing but luck (unless he's really just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">that good</a></em>). At his bad days, he only escapes from overwhelming fleets; on his better days, he sinks them. Without any weapon. Or fighter. Damn, they sink themselves.
<ul><li> The show itself goes to significant lengths to suggest that this is subverted, and Tyler is just that skilled and using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> to hide his brilliant tactics.

He leaks info to their enemy, and is never ever caught, or not believed. And during the finale he in short order 1.

Manages to fight the one guy with superior power that won't kill anybody, allowing him to escape. 3. Launches a pod with data critical to his plan at 2 warring armies and the army that he needed to retrieve it is able to get it because the hero on the other side has a nervous breakdown in battle. 4. The people with the data (the data enables nuclear power) opt to use all of it on nuclear missiles rather than solve their more immediately energy crisis and nuke their enemy. 5. His own army has a superweapon of their own that they are now willing to use and both sides are now posed to wipe out each other (and thus humanity) to total extinction. His luck finally runs out on the last day, when he's unable to break the hero, who kills him, and his plan is foiled when the hero's sidekick is able to stop the superweapons.

He might run into someone equally or more lucky and face a serious contest; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForWinners">Second Place Is for Winners</a> may work for him when it looks like he's losing, but it may also turn against him when it looks like he was winning; he may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>, winning a constant stream of prizes everywhere even though he doesn't want to; or, in one Don Rosa story (see below), his luck may even produce extremely unlikely events when that is to his <em>disadvantage</em>, so that he wins when he's likely to lose but loses if he's overwhelmingly likely to win. He supposedly always wins against Donald, but often he doesn't if Donald gets good karma by being braver or fairer than him. He can sometimes temporarily woo Daisy, but that's one thing in which he often loses to Donald. And sometimes when he seems to "win", it turns out that he was (by his standards) trying too hard, and Donald managed to gather the actual (or at least a slightly) better reward because Gladstone had left too soon. There have also been occasions when Donald uses his Italian superhero persona Paperinik to mess with Gladstone, and his superhero cool seems to entirely negate Gladstone's luck. These ones have a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFantasy">Power Fantasy</a> thing going on, like many Paperinik stories. <br/><br/>Generally, when <em>heroics</em> need to be done, Donald (or the nephews) gets to use whatever karma Donald gained by taking a lot of misfortune (usually because of Gladstone's good luck hurting Donald) to pull off feats where you need a LOT of luck to pull off heroism (such as saving the millionaire's young daughter by steering the runaway speedboat away from running aground on sharp rocks). Even if it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">The Greatest Story Never Told</a> in the process, that's why <strong>Donald,</strong> not Gladstone, is often the hero. However, that's not to say that Gladstone can't be a hero. Sometimes when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBystander">Gladstone learns there's trouble, he goes in to help, relying nothing more on himself</a>. A noteworthy example was when Donald was drowning in a river. He dived in immediately to save him, swam against the current and gave him the attention needed until medical assistance arrived.
<ul><li> Perhaps the most spectacular example of this luck is when Gladstone gets saddled with a contract to move a house from the top of one mountain to the top of another: A hurricane comes by and moves the house from the mountain to the other with no damage to it whatsoever.
</li><li> Subverted in one comic where Donald and his nephews dig up every square inch of a beach, looking for a sultan's lost ruby (with a massive reward attached). Gladstone just lies there and waits for his luck to bring it to him. At the end of the day, a cop busts Donald for digging up the beach, Gladstone goes home... only leaving Huey, Dewey, and Louie to dig in the one <strong>exact</strong> spot they never searched — the one Gladstone was lying on. It's right there. The ruby was directly under Gladstone the whole time, and he never found it because he was waiting for it to fall into his hands. And guess who ended up as a chauffeur to Donald and his nephews...
</li><li> Zigzagged twelve ways until Sunday in one comic, where he and Donald both enter a fishing contest. Gladstone quickly catches what appears to be the largest fish in the water with no effort at all, while Donald's rod breaks. Huey, Dewey, and Louie, meanwhile, run into a fellow who knows where far bigger fish swim (he himself only didn't win the contest because he'd already won plenty of times). The nephews catch a fish larger than Gladstone's and attach it to Donald's boat, making it look like Donald will win. As everyone is heading for shore though, Donald's boat is hit by a runaway speedboat, knocking his fish into Gladstone's boat and letting Gladstone win the contest. Donald gets the last laugh though when it turns out that the young daughter of a millionaire was trapped on the speedboat and had a large reward for whoever could save her. So while Gladstone's luck got him to win the contest, Donald ended up getting a much bigger reward than the prize (even the final panel's caption says "and for once, Donald wins!").
</li><li> Again zig-zagged on another comic where Donald and his nephews race against Gladstone to get to a long-lost Viking ship that was full of riches. Donald and the kids went through all kinds of hell (including losing their ship right when they were close to the Viking ship), while Gladstone managed (somehow) to round up a full expedition with a top-notch ship. After gathering all of the riches on the ship (pretty much everything not nailed down) and leaving Donald and his nephews on the sinking galleon, Donald found a single scrap of paper... which happened to be a map made by the Vikings that was hard-core proof that they had sailed on that area (when nobody else believed they had ever done so). With the ship now gone, this proof would be worth more than everything else that had been on the ship to any museum.
</li><li> His annoying lucky streak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptoEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptoEleven">extends to</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">beyond the pages.</a></em> When the Italian branch of Disney (it actually happened) got the idea to playfully point out which crimes the Disney characters would have committed if they were real-life characters, guess who was the <em>only</em> one who got away with a clean criminal record? However, a number of readers have noted this is probably because Gladstone rarely does <em>anything</em> other than wallow in his own luck.
</li><li> In one comic he did have a "charm" of some sort, kept in a vault that he never let anyone see inside. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was a dime like Scrooge's. But it turns out it wasn't a charm at all; it was the only honest salary he has ever made, and he got it during a time where his luck momentarily failed him and he had to get an actual job. Gladstone was so ashamed of having been reduced to working for a living that he kept the dime inside the vault just so he'd never have to see it.</span>
</li><li> As an example of his apparent unlucky moments being blessings in disguise. In one Don Rosa story, a contest involved catching entries tied to balloons and when a balloon flies above Gladstone, he refuses to exert himself reaching for it, reasoning that if it was the winning entry, the balloon would pop and drop the entry into his hand, which actually happened. Donald's nephews, however, use Gladstone's luck against him, by filling the ballot with tickets with his name on it, and only one with Donald's. Just as Gladstone, sure of his victory, picks out the winning ticket, and hands it to the judges, he realizes to his horror that picking out Donald's ticket would truly require luck. And sure enough, the ticket is Donald's. But then later, his consolation prize (a year's supply of oolated squiggs) turns out to include a fish that swallowed a 10 carat diamond, while the main price, a cruise on a ship, ends up getting icebound, leaving Donald with the worst vacation ever.
</li><li> Inverted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> comic. Due to being struck by lightning on his birthday while in front of a magic symbol in his youth, Gladstone is always phenomenally <em>unlucky</em> on his birthdays. He spends the entire comic trying to get away from attending, but circumstances bring him to his own party, where he admits the truth. When a lightning storm suddenly shows up he manages to undo the curse, and prevent Donald from gaining luck powers of his own.
</li><li> And on top of that, his luck occasionally got him into more trouble than he would have been in without it. One story involved a treasure in the Amazon, and he decided he needed a helicopter to get to it before Donald could. He got there, but he didn't know that the tribe native to the area attached negative superstitions to helicopters. (Yes, they played with this character a <em>lot</em>. As a general rule, Gladstone's luck works at its best when he just lets it flow. When Gladstone asks for something specific, most of the time it come back to bite him. Lazing around is his most profitable activity.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ALittleSomethingSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ALittleSomethingSpecial">A Little Something Special</a></em>, Gladstone Gander actually <em>weaponizes</em> his lucky streak when the main villain is about to escape by asking the police captain to put a bounty on his head, causing a sudden wind to dispatch the villain and landing in front of Gladstone's feet so that he can collect the reward.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> story <em>Nobody's Business</em>, Gladstone is challenged to make a profit by investing $1000 he receives from Scrooge. Gladstone proceeds to do very well indeed, and then Scrooge learns that all of the profits that Gladstone made came at the expense of business deals that Scrooge had made earlier. This leave Scrooge mortified, and he declares that the Gladstone Luck is the one thing even <em>his</em> business sense can never hope to challenge. To avoid being bankrupted, as per the terms of his declaration, he gives Gladstone ownership of a company in the one business that he would never, ever be tempted to get into — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor">a comic book company</a>.
</li><li> In one particular story, his luck ends up biting him in the ass in another way. Other characters simply get so feed up by his smug attitude and just how he takes his luck for granted. This leads to him trying to nullify his luck to try and fix things resulting in him suffering constant bad luck, not so much from actual misfortune, but rather due to him having taken his luck for granted for so long that he ends up inviting constant misfortune on himself through his actions alone. He eventually get's the luck restored when he can't take being normal anymore. And though he still acts smug around others, as soon as no one is looking he shows that he ended up learning some humility as well as taking pleasure with the simple things in life such as finding fulfillment in stuff he put actual effort in, such as growing a plant.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the sum of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Longshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Longshot">Longshot</a>'s powers. After appearing in a miniseries of his own, he was grabbed by Chris Claremont for a stint in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, despite not originally being a mutant (he was first thought to be a genetically engineered alien). Longshot's luck was extremely strong but limited: it could only be used for altruistic purposes.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Universe</a> version has even better luck with no such restriction. In his first appearance, a man is about to kill him with a machete and is suddenly struck by lightning. On a clear day. Without damaging anything in the area.
<ul><li> The only one who has ever defeated him was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a>, a mutant who also has the power to manipulate luck.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Domino from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Comics</a>, (best known from her X-Force days); her probability-altering powers are not as strong as Longshot, things just tend to fall in her favor.
<ul><li> It could be pretty powerful sometimes, though. For example, there was a time when somebody put a revolver to her head and pulled the trigger. Six times. All six bullets failed to fire. The odds of this actually happening are, needless to say, astronomically low.
</li><li> Unlike most of the examples here, she can actively trigger her powers as well. She once had to infiltrate a mansion to open a safe. She had no idea what the combination of the safe was, so she just entered the telephone number of one of her ex-boyfriends (who had nothing to do with the mission or the safe). She is not surprised when it opened the safe.
<ul><li> She doesn't actively trigger her powers in the sense that she can turn the luck on or off, it's more like she has to be aware of what she is affecting the probability of. From TOW, "if debris falling from the sky was about to hit her in the head, she would still be hurt if she stood still. However, if she tried to avoid it, she would move perfectly to avoid each and every piece about to hit her."
</li></ul></li><li> Same thing was used in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> story, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psyker</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">Circus of Fear</a> manipulated the odds so that her boss, seeing the six misfires, angrily tried the same on himself. Bang.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a>, who first appeared in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s adventures has (well, sometimes) an interesting inversion of this: She gave OTHER people bad luck. Good when it affects your enemies, bad when it affects your friends...
</li><li> A largely defunct American manga, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheonHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheonHigh">Pantheon High</a></em>, had a character with this kind of luck because he was the son of the Japanese goddess of luck, Benten. (Un)fortunately he had no guarantee whatsoever of getting lucky in ways that are actually useful to his situation. When he and two girls are threatened by the World Snake, one of the girls remarks that he might end up beating the snake, or he might end up making out with both of them at once.
</li><li> It could be argued that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrooTheWanderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrooTheWanderer">Groo the Wanderer</a></em> fits this trope - all the bad things happen around him, afflicting everybody else, never Groo himself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpirouAndFantasio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpirouAndFantasio">Spirou and Fantasio</a> fit this trope whenever they appear in the same story as Don Vito Cortizone, alias "Vito La Déveine" (French for Hard Luck Vito). In the comic book featuring Vito's first appearance, he chooses them <em>because of their luck</em>.
</li><li> Spawny Get from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz">Viz</a></em> embodies this trope, typically having a piece of moderate bad luck that causes a piece of very, very good luck. In one strip, he is carrying a ten-pound note into a bookmaker's to place a bet when he slips on a turd; he lets go of the money and yells "Oh bugger, I've skidded on a dog dirt!" The ten-pound note flies into the hand of the bookmaker, who assumes Spawny Get is placing a bet on a horse called "Oh bugger, I've skidded on a dog dirt". Which wins. At odds of 1,000-1.
</li><li> This was explicitly the only power of Johnny Thunder, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a> character best known for his membership in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a>. He was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSeventhSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSeventhSon">seventh son of a seventh son</a>, born on July 7th, 1917, and this gave him uncanny luck. It later turned out that the circumstances of his birth had given him control over a genie called the Thunderbolt, and it was the T-bolt who pulled him out of so many jams.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em> has Wedge Antilles, the "designated survivor" and everyman of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>, who is sometimes seen in-universe as lucky, though it's not to the extent of most people on this page. There was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">one-shot comic</a> called "Lucky", the cover mentioning "The Curse of Wedge Antilles"; in it he <a class="urllink" href="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3572/blz44.jpg">thinks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/8813/blz45.jpg">about<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/7343/blz46.jpg">it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, flashes back to his first love and how she and most others around where he lived were killed while he was "luckily" away, and thinks "<a class="urllink" href="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/1237/blz57.jpg">Lucky? Sometimes it doesn't feel like it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>" When he was a child, he was "lucky" enough to be some distance away from his parents' refueling station when they were killed. At many, <em>many</em> points, he was "lucky" enough to survive events that killed his companions and friends; he once reflects on the first Death Star and how he was "lucky" enough to be able to fly away while Biggs Darklighter stayed and was killed. In the novels he is vaguely aware of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>, at least in that it seems like friends are always dying while he lives, has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">survivor's guilt</a>, and wonders what will happen when his luck runs out.
<ul><li> To some extent, Baron Soontir Fel as well, Wedge's Imperial (metaphorical) twin. He is undoubtedly the best damn pilot in the Empire next to Vader, but surviving two tours of duty in the ridiculously fragile TIE fighter or TIE Interceptor takes more than mere skill. Even when he was finally shot down by Wedge, he survived with no injury. Despite the fact that a TIE Interceptor is such a physically small craft that downing one without killing the pilot is near-impossible even if you have a Jedi actively <em>trying</em> to do so.
</li><li> One novel had some fun with this when Wedge Antilles as a general was coordinating a battle which they were supposed to lose (well, retreat believably) as a part of a larger strategic maneuver. To put it in his own words: "We're about to achieve a tremendous victory we don't want."
</li></ul></li><li> The Marvel heroine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainEthnic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainEthnic">Shamrock</a> appears to have this power, though it's actually a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">I See Dead People</a>—ghosts often agree to help her in return for her completing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a>.

</li><li> Talisman from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeMachine">Justice Machine</a></em> comics. His mutant power is Karma — as long as he's working for a righteous cause, good things happen to/for him (and by extension his teammates). One of the team's standard combat maneuvers is "let Talisman be taken hostage and dare the villains to shoot him".
</li><li> Roulette from the Hellions, enemies of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a>, could create disks of energy that affected probabilities (white for good luck, black for bad).

In the years between his discovery and eventual takeover, nobody in the royal court stopped to both think about why he was being shot at and/or plan ahead in case he tried something. He later stole the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticization">roboticizer</a> from Uncle Chuck, who seemed way too open about it given what it could do, gaining the means to build up his robot army. Even King Max, who was literally being guided by a primordial intellect, was taken by surprise at Robotnik's takeover. As the book has gone on and revealed all the powerful wizards, factions, and occasions that could've ended in his defeat, but have obviously not, he really seems to be this. To the point that Sonic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Chaos Factor</a> is really just someone finally getting a counter ability.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a>. He becomes, in chronological order: able to walk after being born disabled, a football star, war hero, Olympic champion, successful business owner, multimillionaire stockholder, and national phenomenon, all just out of sheer chance while bumbling his way through life. Not to mention setting various historical events in motion without even realizing it... It's strongly hinted that he isn't really disabled, but his mother (being equally naive) is being conned by a quack doctor. His luck is in being scared into running himself out of the braces on his legs, and concluding that he's miraculously got better. While Gump really is incredibly lucky throughout the film, it should be noted that this often happens because of him doing what he believes to be the right thing to do. A major theme of the film is Forrest doing things that everyone considers stupid just because he doesn't consider the pros and cons like everyone else, and just does the simplest thing with childlike sincerity. One of the best examples is him becoming a war hero without firing a single bullet: he goes to the jungle to find his friend, and he ends up personally carrying to safety what is implied to be ALL his injured squadmates instead of, say, calling for someone to help them. His only reaction to being told to stop because napalm is about to be dropped in the jungle is to yell "I've gotta find Bubba!" So while he is incredibly lucky and, in a way, he doesn't know any better, he DOES become a war hero because he does something heroic. There are other situations in the film where he is very lucky as sort of a karmic payoff for doing something silly, but noble in its simplicity. His shrimping business takes off because he was the only one foolish enough to try and ride out a hurricane; all his competitor's boats were smashed in the harbor, while he and Lieutenant Dan amused themselves bobbing on the waves (leaving the previously over-fished waters all for him).

<ul><li> Ways, from the Terry Pratchett science fiction novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkSideOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkSideOfTheSun">The Dark Side of the Sun</a></em> is a robot built with an intrinsic ability with p-math, meaning he can manipulate probability to make himself lucky. In one scene he's forced to roll 3 sixes twice in a row at gunpoint to prove his identity.
<ul><li> Rincewind, another of Pratchett's creations from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, has the most amazing luck (thanks to being the pawn of <em>the Lady</em> herself), and has leapfrogged in, out, around, and through so many sticky situations relatively unscathed that even Death doesn't know when he'll die. Bear in mind, however, that in this case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">amazing luck doesn't necessarily mean amazingly ''good'' luck</a>.
<ul><li> As stated above, Rincewind is amazingly lucky because he survives everything he's put through. Rincewind himself feels it would be luckier <em>not</em> to go through these things at all, but the Lady doesn't seem to see it that way...
</li><li> The problem is that while <em>the Lady</em> blesses him on a regular basis, <em>Fate</em> is out to get him. Literally. The two of them are playing a board game, and Rincewind is one of the Lady's favorite pieces that Fate is always trying to take off the board.
</li></ul></li><li> Nobby and Sergeant Colon are also Born Lucky. As Watchmen, they are always stumbling across important clues (usually without realizing it) and surviving "million to one" events seemingly by chance. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em>, they have demonstrated this power so often Commander Vimes finally catches on and gives orders to just let them follow their noses, confident they'll trip over the key to the mystery sooner or later.
</li></ul></li><li> Teela Brown, in Larry Niven's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em>, was the result of a project to try to breed a person with supernatural luck: she, and her ancestors for seven generations, were all born because of lucky draws in Earth's Birthright Lottery. The Puppeteers figure that humanity exists primarily due to luck anyhow (since humans are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">Puny Earthlings</a>), so breeding for luck will make humans extremely lucky. There is much debate about whether she is extremely lucky, and, for that matter, what it means to be extremely lucky.
<ul><li> The debate is mainly between the other main protagonists. Louis thinks she's lucky because she has survived many brushes with death, each time by pure chance. Nessus argues that her luck does not exist because the rest of the crew was not protected. Louis counters that the luck works only to preserve her and her fortunate genes; he says that her luck brought them to the Ringworld in the first place because it will be the safest place for her descendants to ride out an inevitable galactic disaster.
<ul><li> The counter-counter-argument is that the Puppeteers were already planning this expedition before they started the breeding program that produced Teela. In-universe, there are yet more viewpoints and further levels of argument.
</li><li> Canon indicates that the luck is real. Niven has a later story in this universe, <em>Safe at Any Speed,</em> showing a future world populated by people even luckier than Teela. The protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets swallowed by a giant pterodactyl</span> and comes out perfectly unhurt.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, when recruiting for the mission, they have a lot of trouble filling the Born Lucky slot. Teela Brown is the only one they can reach since attempts to call the others end in very improbable failures. Either Teela's luck is causing her to <em>win</em> a position on the mission by process of elimination, or the luck of all those other candidates is causing her to <em>lose.</em>
<ul><li> Funny thing is, Teela refuses (at Louis's urging) to join the mission at first, at which point Nessus receives word from another Puppeteer that another candidate was found. Apparently, Nessus doesn't talk to the others of his kind much because this "other candidate" is once again Teela.
</li></ul></li><li> This seems to change in the sequel, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teela ends up eating the Tree-of-Life root and becoming a Protector, ensuring that her genes will not be preserved, as Protectors are unable to reproduce. She also allows herself to be killed during the climax in order to preserve the Ringworld</span>.
<ul><li> This seems to change in the sequel to the sequel, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teela had allowed her contraception implant to expire so that she could bear Louis' child (she loved him and he was a hero and he had good genes) but never told him before she left the expedition to remain on the Ringworld. Teela was protecting her child by arranging for the Ringworld to be saved since she could not do it herself and by dying so that her child would not be held ransom by the existing protector who she knew about but had been unable to find to kill</span>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurkishGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurkishGambit">The Turkish Gambit</a></em> (and its movie adaptation), he exploits this to win a donkey in an inn in a game of dice to transport away Varvara Suvorova... who later discovers, to her shock, that she was his stake. Later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpecialAssignments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpecialAssignments">The Jack of Spades</a></em>, he uses this ability to expose a fake lottery wherein he loses his bet (meaning that there was not a single chance to win, otherwise, he would have). Even later, he plays Russian roulette in front of a suicide club president to convince the latter to accept him to the club. In fact, he comes from a family where luck always skips a generation: his father and only son were extremely unlucky, while his grandson (Nicholas Fandorin) was extremely lucky again.
</li><li> Rene Arroy in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArciaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArciaChronicles">Arcia Chronicles</a></em> is actually nicknamed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">the Lucky One</a>" or "Lucky Rene" for his improbable luck that saves his skin again and again throughout his life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">unlife</a></span>.
</li><li> Subverted in the Alfred Bester story "Oddy and Id". Oddy has the ability (unknown to himself) to have everything go in his favor. The subversion is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what he gets is what his id wants, not what his ego does. So while he really wishes for peace, his id really wants him to be galactic dictator and a war soon enables this</span>.
</li><li> This is one of Mat Cauthon's defining characteristics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series. He goes from the son of a horse trader in a small town into a rich gambler throwing around money like it grows on trees simply because he can regain it easily. While all three of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange">''ta'veren'' characters</a> tend to twist probability and cause unlikely and bizarre events to happen just by being there, those events can be either good or bad. Mat, however, adds an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasAGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasAGift">elven gift</a> of luck to this. Not only does he have amazing luck in general (including battle), but his <em>gambling</em> luck is openly supernatural: If he's paying attention, coins are liable to land on edge, and dice on their <em>corners</em>. (Happily, this sort of thing never happens when it would have gotten him killed....)
<ul><li> It should be noted that his luck can often be a string of bad luck that turns out to be useful to him in the end, such as losing a dice roll when winning would result in a fight, or losing many rolls as a sign that something is about to happen.
<ul><li> As a matter of fact, his luck is so predictable that he <em>WEAPONIZES</em> it - if he's getting too poor of a streak, he and his friends know the fecal matter is going to hit the impeller, because his good luck is "being stored up" for what's to come, which has saved their hides several times.

That he just happened to be born with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, there's a potion, Felix Felicis, that gives the user luck and will make everything go their way, usually in improbable ways. For example, when Harry drank it, he accidentally bumped into Ginny while invisible, causing her to think it was her current boyfriend, and got unusually annoyed and dump him, so that leaves her open for Harry. It also gave Harry the perfect chance to bribe Slughorn. Later it is used by nearly all the main characters to survive the climactic battle. The effects are temporary, and Slughorn advised against abusing the potion, as it'd make one reckless after a while. It's also banned from sporting events, essays, and elections.
<ul><li> And in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a> Harry acts so mellow that you'd think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug">it was a luck</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">joint</a></em>.
</li><li> It should be noted that the potion doesn't actually make one <em>lucky</em>, per se. Rather, it lets the user instinctively take actions that will bring them towards the best possible outcome.

As he puts it, if you're standing next to him and win a million dollars, rest assured that you'll have lost it again by nightfall.
</li><li> Bink's power in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> looks like this, but it's actually that magic can't harm him. This was determined to be a top-tier magic talent.
<ul><li> Given that everything in Xanth is at least partially magical, it is.
</li><li> The reason his talent manifests as luck is because his talent can't hurt him either. In other words, it makes it look as though he's just lucky at avoiding magic because if fireballs just bounced off him, people would just start punching him. And that would be his talent causing people to punch him, thus harming him indirectly via magic. In the finale of the first book, it manifested <em>by having his enemy work it out</em> through being unusually blatant; when he then attacked with his sword it set off an unlikely chain of events that ended with them reconciling their differences.

<div class="indent">"The gods always smiled on Watt, though. When the wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls, somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water. How lucky was that, missing all those rocks?"
</div><div class="indent">"Was it a long fall?" Grenn wanted to know. "Did landing in the pool of water save his life?"
</div><div class="indent">"No," said Dolorous Edd. "He was dead already, from that axe in his head. Still, it was pretty lucky, missing the rocks."
</div><ul><li> Edd's own bad luck is interesting as well despite being at least partially a matter of perception. For example, when they name one of their scarecrows after him it gets filled with arrows by the enemy but once the men start betting on which scarecrow will get hit the most Edd's one stops being hit.
</li><li> Ramsay Snow is reckless, stupid and is the most hated man in the North, by all logic he should have gotten himself killed years ago, but things always seem to go his way somehow.
<ul><li> Given that his father was there to rein him in for most of his later life, it is not that surprising that he is still alive. The first time he really gets to act up is when his father leaves for war, and even then, he very nearly dies after news spread of his actions.

<ul><li> There are Oponn, the Twin Jesters of Chance. The female Oponn, the Lady, will sometimes give mortals what is referred to as the Lady's Pull, making them lucky, with occurrences like "avoiding an assassin's crossbow bolt by picking up a coin" or "killing an enemy by tripping and falling into them with your sword". It's suggested that this eventually turns around on the poor mortal, which is known as the Lord's Push.

Multiple arrows fired into his back all strike the same spear shaft hanging on his back. On the other hand, everything he tries results in a lucky fumble  he will drop his weapon if he swings it, but it will trip up his foe. This is exploited at one point when his squad needs to take down an officer but can't get close enough for a clear shot: Corabb is made to fire the crossbow, which predictably causes the shot to go wildly off-mark, but the ricochet causes it to impale the target's neck perfectly.

He's a wide-eyed innocent youth serving under Captain Steyn (a freighter captain and sometimes smuggler). She has him on the crew entirely because he's Born Lucky (well, that and she's quite fond of him). He has a natural affinity for gambling and seems to somehow tap into...something...other beings can't, so as to always win. Note that this is consistent with the TV show, which occasionally suggested luck was governed by an unknown force that could be sensed or even controlled. Quite why this boy has the talent remains unexplained. Steyn apparently doesn't care, she's just happy it makes her money.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds">Super Powereds</a></em>, this is Nick's power. Unfortunately, since he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Powered</a>, not a Super, he can't control it, so it usually results in a stroke of good luck followed by a stroke of misfortune (he calls it his "bipolar luck"). For example, he's introduced having just won the lottery, gotten hit by a truck while celebrating, safely landing on a bouncy castle nearby, and the air compressor exploding. He survived, but all the winnings went to cover his hospital bills and the lawsuit filed by the guy who was renting the bouncy castle. Thankfully, the secret procedure he undergoes to turn him into a Super grants him control over his ability, so now he uses it to exclusively get good luck. After winter break, he returns to college having just won a VW Beetle in Vegas. His dormmate Vince demands that Nick return the car, since Nick, technically, cheated by using his ability to win. Nick counters by pointing out that he merely fulfilled the conditions set forth by the contest. Nick keeps the car. Interestingly, when the college has a casino night, he doesn't use his ability when playing blackjack. He is, however, very good at counting cards, having been taught by his aunt, a Vegas casino owner.

Typically, they only dole it out in small doses, but when their race is threatened with extinction, they pool all their good luck for the sisters. They also note that luck increases when you take risks, thus Phoebe, who does nothing with her dose, doesn't feel particularly lucky, whereas Paige brings Piper right to a casino and winds up winning almost a million dollars in craps.

<ul><li> Many tabletop games use an "action dice" system which allows a player to add another die to a roll's final result to avoid bad luck, create an exceptionally good result, etc, a certain number of times a session.
</li><li> A version of this is part of a deity's legend in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>. Tymora, goddess of luck, supposedly flips a coin for every person born in Faerun. If it comes up heads, that person will have good luck in their life. If it's tails, naturally, bad luck follows. And for those extremely lucky few where the coin lands on its edge...they make their own luck, not being fated to anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SavageWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SavageWorlds">Savage Worlds</a></em> has the "Luck" and "Great Luck" advantages, which give you one and then two more spare die re-rolls per game session.
</li><li> <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> models super-luck by allowing characters with the power, like Longshot listed above, to pick which die is the tens die and which the ones die when rolling d100. Look into the statistics of that die roll and you'll see it's the most powerful ability in the game.
</li><li> Halflings in 4.0 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> have a power that basically emulates really good luck. And in 3.5 you had the Fate-Spinners, whose entire arsenal of powers was based around luck manipulation.
<ul><li> 3rd edition Halflings were inherently lucky as well, reflected in their racial +1 to all saving throws.
</li><li> The 3.5 sourcebook Complete Scoundrel had a prestige class based around this trope. The "Fortune's Friend" could force so many re-rolls a day in so many different situations that he must have been as infuriating to the DM and his teammates as he was to his foes.
</li><li> There was also the Luckstealer from <em>Races of the Wild</em>, who could curse others with bad luck, and claim their good luck for himself.
</li><li> In 5th edition, an available feat is "Lucky", which grants players three "luck points" that they can spend to re-roll an ability check, take advantage on a roll or force an opponent to take disadvantage (in effect, forcing the DM to use a bad roll if attacking the player).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> it is possible to give characters varying levels of the Advantage aptly named "Luck". There is also Super-Luck which, while much more expensive, is well explained by a nearby picture of a man standing in an alleyway surrounded by bullet holes. There is also another Advantage called "Serendipity" which causes fortunate coincidences outside of dice rolls as the GM sees fit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> features "Luck Control" as a superpower which allows the user to change the effects of other character's dice rolls, helping your allies and hindering your enemies. "Probability Control" from the <em>Ultimate Power</em> sourcebook is a more traditional example of this trope; your power rank becomes the minimum result for any one die roll that round. To put it another way, a person with 20 ranks in this power could essentially throw their dice away and declare "I win."

Among other things, there is an ability that causes you to roll a die after being hit by any attack. If it comes up odd, circumstances interfere and the attack misses entirely and you take no damage instead. Extra funny because it applies to things like nuclear explosions and buildings falling on you as much as the usual bullets and fists.

She has an occasional chance of causing more damage than normal, and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">CO and Super CO powers</a> amplify this luck immensely. Her sister, Rachel, doesn't have Nell's normal luck but her CO Power (though not Super CO Power) increases her luck for the turn.

<ul><li> The two vary a little. Flak and Jugger's luck (good or bad) still falls within the realm of normality, as while they can do more (or less) damage than expected, it doesn't allow for anything blatantly unexpected (e.g. infantry dealing serious damage to tanks with their machine guns). Nell's (and Rachel's, during her CO Power) luck, on the other hand, <em>can</em> result in the highly improbable and unrealistic, as her luck is treated mechanically as a random flat increase to damage rather than the random percent multiplier of the normal damage that Flak and Jugger get.

You first meet him as a sort-of beggar in Mournhold, where he will demand that you give him some money. If you do, he will continue to ask for more until it reaches outrageous sums you probably won't be able to pay and even if you can, he won't believe you really have the money anyway. Either way, pay him or deny him the money, he will get angry. Come back a few days later to encounter him again. This time, he is wearing a full set of (extremely expensive and powerful) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyMetals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyMetals">Ebony Armor</a>. He will confront you and tell you how he came upon a Lucky Charm. Ever since he found it, he had insane amounts of luck, money was practically falling into his pockets all the time, he never lost a fight, hell, he never even got injured. Then he decides to take revenge on you. While in battle, he lacks any significant powerful attacks, but his insane luck makes more than up for it. In-game, all the important chances, such as whether or not a blow will hit or miss or whether or not a Magic Reflection/Damage Reflection spell will kick in, is influenced in part by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat">Luck Stat</a>. That includes attack evasion, damage reflection, and spell reflection. Gaenor is so lucky that <em>he can make you kill yourself by attacking him</em>. Should you, despite all the odds, manage to kill him, you can loot the lucky charm from his pockets, but while the enchantment is certainly powerful, it only grants 20 Luck points.

His mentor/treasure hunting companion Victor Sullivan even opts out of the second game because he doesn't "have [Nate's] luck". This apparently also applies in-game as well, with the notion put forward by the developers that the screen graying as you take damage is not a representation of "health" but rather "luck" (that is none of the enemy bullets that don't kill Nate actually hit him, just graze him or fly very close, but the one that does Nate in is a direct hit).

On Chugga's roll, he uses a Mega Mushroom, and rolls enough to bypass the space Masae and therefore Wario are on (a bit shy of 1 in 2, so 1 in 600), stealing 10 coins from each, and, thanks to swapping coins with Masae earlier, this got him enough coins to swipe the coin star from under Wario's nose, winning Chugga the game... through events that had a less than a 1 in 600 (or 0.166%) chance of occurring together.</span>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> allegedly had as a hiring policy that whenever he was asked to decide between two people with equal recommendations he'd ask them if they were lucky. Reasoning that if you don't know who to pick, you might as well pick the one who has been lucky thus far.
<ul><li> Odd as it may seem, there is some merit to this question. The goal is not to find out who's lucky, but who <em>thinks</em> they're lucky. People who are conscientious, prepared, alert and intelligent are more likely to recognize opportunities and avoid pitfalls. Because these habits are internalized and taken for granted, it's common for capable people to ascribe at least some of their success to good luck. By contrast, people with less capability and ineffective habits frequently blame poor luck for their failures, rather than trying to recognize and correct their own flaws.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the most infamous people in history: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. While he was of average intelligence and had incredible skills as an orator, his rise to power and rule over practically all of Europe was by sole virtue of dumb luck. He survived a gas attack in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> merely because he was lucky. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a> messed up the world's economy just as Germany was starting to recover economically, the Treaty of Versailles produced huge backlash and anger in Germany, and the Jews were a convenient target as anti-Semitism was on the rise. Hitler showed up just as all this was happening with fiery oratory about how Germany deserved better and Jews were to blame, and Germans responded in force. Then, when he was in control, his legitimate threat to the world was ignored because the Soviet Union under Stalin had started to act up, letting Hitler build power with a relatively free hand. When the German army had great difficulty penetrating the superior armor of French tanks, the desperate tactic of turning the anti-air guns on the enemy tanks worked brilliantly, saving the war for Germany and letting them conquer France. When people actually started trying to kill him, he survived far more assassination attempts than anyone really should (not by awareness or the competence of his guards, but solely because he was lucky). One incident involved him deciding, <em>for no apparent reason,</em> to shorten a speech from an hour to eight minutes then leave; the building exploded shortly after he left or when a silent bomb with 30 minutes fuse was put on his plane but the bomb didn't explode because the percussion cap became too cold as the parcel was carried in the unheated cargo hold. The "Valkyrie" attack plan would have worked, but the bomb was <em>moved one foot</em> behind a table leg just before it went off. Historians are actually <em>aware</em> of this, and have coined the term "Devil's Luck" to describe Hitler. Eventually, his luck ran out but even then, he ended up dying by his own hand. All of those lucky escapes just fed into Hitler's belief that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>, feeling that <em>obviously</em> he kept surviving because he had a greater purpose to fulfill.
</li><li> Timothy Dexter, who became wealthy after marrying a wealthy widow, was persuaded by his friends to invest his wealth into all sorts of ridiculously dumb things. When Dexter sent mittens and warming plates to the West Indies, the mittens were bought by Asian traders next headed to Siberia and the warming plates were sold as ladles to the molasses industry. When Dexter shipped coal to Newcastle (the British capital for coal mining at the time), it arrived during a strike and was bought quickly for a great price. When he played the stock market by buying stocks at random, all of them went up. When he wrote a book called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APickleForTheKnowingOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APickleForTheKnowingOnes">A Pickle For The Nowing Ones</a>"—a travesty of literature—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">it sold very well</a> and is a popular collectors item today. To give an idea as to just <em>how</em> blindly lucky he was, he's the only example <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheFool/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheFool/RealLife">for The Fool under Real Life.</a>
<ul><li> He actually made it into The Book Of Lists for shipping coal to Newcastle (along with such others as selling oil products, specifically lighter fluid, which was too small a market to bother building a refinery locally to produce, to Saudi Arabia). Every one of the entries on the list was something that's generally used as an example of a stupid thing to ship to a particular place.
</li></ul></li><li> A man named Tsutomu Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima when the atomic bomb was dropped. He was injured and spent the night there before returning to his hometown. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Which was</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Nagasaki</a>. He survived again and lived to the ripe old age of 93. If that's not simultaneously the worst and best luck in the world, then what is?
<ul><li> Even more than that, Yamaguchi returned to Nagasaki still significantly injured, so he went to see a doctor. The doctor asked him how he had been injured, and <em>as Yamaguchi was explaining the vaporization of Hiroshima, the second bomb dropped</em>. In the middle of his explanation. That's remarkable coincidence.
</li><li> Other sources say that he was in the office of his supervisor, explaining what he'd experienced in Hiroshima. The disbelieving supervisor supposedly told him in exasperation, "You're an engineer. Think about it! How could just one bomb destroy a whole city?" just as the Fat Man exploded.
</li><li> As a result of being one of <em>very</em> few people to survive the only two offensive atomic bombings in history and the longest-lived of them, he became an extremely vocal opponent to nuclear weapons, and his voice was respected in Japan (which, to this day, refuses nuclear derivatives — although nuclear power plants are just fine).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> was not the great general people like to remember him as, at least not in his early career. His early career was noted for a series of catastrophic military failures that he always managed to survive by pure luck. In the Battle of Monongahela during the French and Indian War, four musket balls passed through his cloak without hitting him. His reputation as impossible to kill was such that as soon as they realized who they were shooting at, they aimed for his horse instead. It worked. Twice.
</li><li> Croatian music teacher <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frane_Selak">Frane Selak<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is often referred to as the luckiest man on earth. Hes been in a train wreck (it fell into a ravine, Selak swan into safety, all other 17 passengers died), an airplane crash (the door suddenly opened, he was blown out and landed unscathed in a haystack), a bus crash, his car blew up a few times, he was hit by a city bus, and his car was forced off a cliff by a truck. In 2003, he won $1,000,000 dollars in the Croatian lottery (although not on his first try, as many people rumor, he has been playing for some years).
</li><li> During World War II, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a> served in the Royal Navy. The ship he was initially assigned to was HMS <em>Hood</em>. He transferred off for officer training right before the ship left for her fatal encounter with the German battleship <em>Bismarck</em>, of which only three British sailors survived.
</li><li> Japanese warlord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> (whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrades</a> you can enjoy in dozens of anime, videogames, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">Jidaigeki</a>) was a tactician and strategist of impressive skill and appalling ruthlessness, but it certainly helped that two of the most powerful lords opposing him (and who were also the best generals in Japan during the era) suddenly dropped dead of mysterious causes just as they were about to enter a full-scale war with Nobunaga.
<ul><li> Many Japanese historians debate over whether or not this was sheer luck, given the timing and the fact that Nobunaga had access to men trained in undetectable assassination. This is why historians hate ninja.
