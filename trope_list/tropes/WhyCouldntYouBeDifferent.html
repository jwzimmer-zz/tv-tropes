</div></div><p>Genetics is a highly unpredictable thing. Sometimes it seems to seek to endow offspring with all the best or worst traits available. Hence the characteristic lament of parents who discover that instead of their dream girl, they have a rough-and-tumble boy, or that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">long-awaited manly heir</a> is actually a doe-eyed female. Or the kid simply is the opposite of what they want in talent or personality. Needless to say, this usually does not result in happy-go-lucky familial relations.

If the kid has powers, they'll be forbidden to use them. If they have the wrong gender, they'll have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">imitate their desired gender</a> (even giving them an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName">appropriate name</a>). This always has, at best, mixed success. Often said child catches on to their wish fulfillment and rebels.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>:
<ul><li> You have Ataru Moroboshi whose mother is constantly going "I wish I never had him." There's also a scene where both parents are away reminiscing about their life, and when they start talking about Ataru, both say that they had wanted a girl at the time.
</li><li> Ryuunosuke is the version where her father wishes she was a boy... so he deludes himself into thinking she is one. Ryuunosuke does <strong>not</strong> appreciate this, being fully aware that she's really a girl and wanting nothing more than to be cute and frilly instead of rough and masculine (so much so that even girls who know she's really a girl try to get her to date them... although that might be because all of the real boys in schools are freaks, losers or lechers).
</li></ul></li><li> An unfunny example would be in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsukasa</span>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">father was abusive</a> about wanting a different gendered child. We only explicitly find this out in the end, though it's implied earlier, with, for instance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">scenes of him throwing away a bra she had stolen for herself.</span> He even goes so far as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to pull the plug on Tsukasa's life support which ends up getting him arrested.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles">The Rose of Versailles</a></em> has as its central character Lady Oscar, a French noblewoman raised as a boy by her father (who couldn't manage to produce a male heir). Unlike most characters forced to crossdress, Lady Oscar seems to have no problems dressing and acting like a boy — at least most of the time. (This could be due to the people around her being oddly accepting of her in her role as a woman pretending to be a man — to the point where they even allow her to be a military leader. To be fair, she <em>does</em> have to crack some heads to get some of her subordinates to fully accept her.) At one point it's even <em>inverted</em>: seeing the French Revolution approaching, Oscar's father tries and get her into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> so that she would have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> and away from the fighting, but Oscar ruins the party in which she was supposed to choose her husband and makes clear she <em>wants</em> to act as a man and a military leader because she considers the life of a noblewoman as empty and meaningless.
</li><li> There's a hentai doujin (part of the <em>Secret Plot: Deep</em> series) where a boy who looked like his twin sister was mistaken for her by his parents after her death and started pretending to be his sister while at home, but himself while at school. It all works out in the end, as it turns out the tomboyish gym teacher and his childhood friend both have learned they have fetishes for guys in skirts. One of the few examples (or only) where it works in the end. Of course, one has to wonder how healthy it is for his parents to live a lie, or how long he can keep it up. But then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">Bellisario's Maxim</a>...
</li><li> There's also a Korean series (<em>I.N.V.U.</em>) with the same story for one of the characters, except it was the daughter pretending to be the brother, and only the mother had mistaken her for the son (the son and mother were in an accident, and the son died while the mother forgot the daughter's existence)
</li><li> Yuuri's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> laments that she never had a "cute" girl and is permanently berating him for it. She even dressed him up in dresses when he was younger. (The fact that both her children are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">demon kings</span> doesn't seem to rate on her list of things to be proud of either. Weirdo.) She's actually extremely proud of them both. Very much including the kingship, although the calm with which she's taken that (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">her idea of preparing him for it</a>) is downright bizarre. She just <em>really</em> wanted a girl.
</li><li> Done somewhat humourously in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> (next, I believe), where there's supposedly a church town consisting completely of girls, and men were not allowed, causing some very amusing cross-dressing on the male characters' parts. Once it's found that one girl that Zelgadiss is getting a crush on is a boy, pretty much the rest of the village strips to their underwear to reveal the same. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tv.com/slayers/theyre-talking-about-a-girl-named-zelgadis!/episode/240045/summary.html">Read the summary here if you don't believe it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In <em>Boy Soprano</em>, though Akira is technically an adopted son, his mother raised him as a girl since early childhood, and even made him attend the girls' high school she's the principal of. This is sort of a subversion: Not only does she already have a biological daughter, she doesn't actually wish Akira was a girl, either, and frequently takes advantage of him sexually. In fact, she made him go to the girls' school so she could keep an eye on him (and so that he could get to know his boy-crazy classmates. Even if it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">often explicitly against his will</a>.)
</li><li> Kujira Etorofu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinMusumeHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinMusumeHeart">Penguin Musume Heart</a></em> is raised as a boy by her father, who adamantly keeps denying she is a girl, despite her noticeable large breasts. As another result of this, she is being chased by her childhood friend Cha Chi, who wants her for her "husband". She even was confused about it herself as a kid and at one point confessed to a girl (and not just <em>any</em> girl either). Then again, she might just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">swing that way</a>—and of course there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">nothing wrong with that</a>.
</li><li> Ruki Makino of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> is essentially in the same boat. Her dad wanted a boy, and her mother tried to make her a model. Eventually, mother and daughter reconcile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nagisa's mother puts him in dresses, forces him to wear his hair long, and sees him as her 'second chance' to live the life she wanted, plotting out every aspect of his life.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness">Descendants of Darkness</a></em>'s Hisoka is named after his dead sister, whom his father loved. To make matters worse, he has the ability to sense people's emotions, which caused his parents to label him as a demon and lock him away in a cage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin">Karin</a></em>'s parents really wish she was a normal vampire. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, the fact that she isn't is a major plot point later on.</span>

<ul><li> Akito from the manga. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito's mother Ren raised Akito as a male because she was jealous of the attention Akito received for being born the zodiac God.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Monkey D. Garp really, really wanted his grandsons to be Marines like him instead of going into piracy. Granted, rather than a simple matter of carrying on the legacy, Garp just wanted to be loved by his grandsons and not have to arrest them when they inevitably became highly wanted criminals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact that his only son, Dragon, is the worst criminal in the world probably has something to do with this as well.</span> In spite of all that, he has always been proud of them, because regardless of the fact that they are pirates, he still raised them to be good people. Unfortunately for him, Ace <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is the son of Gold Roger, so he'd never be allowed to join the Marines (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">let alone live</a>),</span> and Luffy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">just kind of an idiot</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though it can be argued that even though Garp was his biological grandfather, Luffy wouldn't have been allowed to join the Marines as well, because of his parentage, similar to that of Ace's.</span>
</li><li> Kyouya of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em> is the youngest of three brothers and therefore is believed to have no chance at running the Ootori family empire. His father pushes him all the time to do better ("being top of your class is something your brothers have already done...") and is never satisfied despite the fact that most non-family think Kyouya is the most striking and has the most potential of the three brothers, and Tamaki's father even scolds Kyouya's father for having four wonderful children (including his daughter) and being completely unsatisfied. Kyouya actually ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> earning enough money through the Host Club to not only buy his father's company but to throw it right back.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSecretAgreement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSecretAgreement">The Secret Agreement</a></em>, Yuuichi is initially abandoned by his clan for appearing to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">muggle</a> but then assigned an unrelated guardian to watch over him in case he starts showing signs of change. In perhaps an inversion, despite his uncle's congratulations when his supernatural side finally awakens, Yuuichi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">horrified at becoming "normal"</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower">The Wallflower</a></em> (or Yamato Nadeshiko Shiche Henge) is based on this trope, as Sunako, a girl traumatized by her first crush telling her she's ugly, grows up to become obsessed with horror movies and darkness, unable to even look at anything "bright" - or pretty. Oddly enough, her actual parents seem okay with it, defending her at school, but her aunt finds it unacceptable. The entire series is based on her aunt trying to get her four tenants (the most handsome boys in school) to turn her niece into a perfect girl - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a>. In fact the Japanese name roughly translates to Perfect Girl Evolution in English.
</li><li> Nono and Yuuta from the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nononono" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nononono">Nononono</a></em> both get this from their father, but in different ways and for different reasons. Yuuta is subject to borderline abuse for not being good enough at ski jumping, and Nono is ignored because, as a girl, she can't compete in the Olympics for the sport.

<ul><li> After a lifetime spent with one wife and a daughter - and a bastard son - he doted on, Henry VIII famously went off the rails in the last third of his life and went through multiple wives in an attempt to father a (legitimate) male heir. His first daughter, Mary, was a big example of this. Elizabeth, his daughter by his second marriage, was such a child as well. The (financial and social) circumstances of both were in constant flux during this period, dependent as they were on their father's goodwill, but Elizabeth generally fared a little better than Mary.
</li><li> A real life example of this trope would be the <em>Sworn Virgins</em> of Albania — women who dress and act like men and who take up male roles in the community. (They are often encouraged to do so if a family produces no male heirs, since it's only men who can inherit property.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood">Ed Wood</a>, the infamous "Worst Director of All Time" and maker of the cult classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em>, was routinely dressed as a girl by his mother (who had wanted him to be female). Ed never grew out of the habit of dressing in women's clothing, and for the rest of his life lived as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">a non-sexually oriented transvestite</a>; his film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GlenOrGlenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GlenOrGlenda">Glen or Glenda</a></em> was based on his experience. (It is rumored he even participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal while secretly wearing a bra and panties beneath his uniform.) Ed personally put forth these rumors, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">so take it with a grain of salt</a>.
<ul><li> Same thing was true about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>.
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RainerMariaRilke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RainerMariaRilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The sad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> of many households with children with learning disabilities, and God help you if your parents prize things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">high grades</a> or how well others view the family.
<ul><li> If any of your parents can't help but desire that you were different, and can't resist the urge to force you in whatever direction they believe is better for you, you are probably screwed (bonus screwing points, when both parents want you to be different in ways that are not only incompatible with your nature but also — in some subtle way that they prefer to ignore — to the desires of each other). This goes beyond the sole gender identity issues: if you hate with all your guts a work they see as the embodiment of human perfection, they are gonna do all they can to force you into it anyway. This is really a mainstay of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> of every kind.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>'s mother was born with the name of Stanley Anne Dunham because — you guessed it — her father wanted a son. She eventually managed to drop the "Stanley".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey">Tina Fey</a> has spent years humorously noting in interviews her annoyance that her daughter Alice has turned out to be such a princess-obsessed girly girl.
