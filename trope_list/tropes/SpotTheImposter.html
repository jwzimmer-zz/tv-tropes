The heroes must find out about the imposter and expose him/her to stop him.
</p><p>Typically, the situation will involve the impostor and the real person standing side-by-side, both claiming to be the real one, and the other heroes must use their wits to identify who is who, usually by finding a quality that the faker doesn't have (in comedic examples, a positive quality). Or the real person may ask that their friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillUsBoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillUsBoth">shoot both of them</a> just to guarantee they get the imposter (and it's almost inevitable if the person has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">super-healing power</a>), which usually results in the heroes shooting the other one, because the impostor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">wouldn't be noble enough</a> to suggest making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. This is often parodied these days where the imposter suggests it, knowing they'll assume the noble act to mark them out as the original  and sometimes double-parodied when this ends up outing him as the fake since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">the real person wouldn't be so noble</a>.

</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a> variants can get really confusing once you add in the possibilities of magic and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>: For example, the victim of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySwap">Body Swap</a> must find a way to convince their friends that the person who looks like them really isn't, while the impostor is trying to convince the same friends that the victim is trying to <em>initiate</em> a body swap instead of <em>undo</em> one.
</p><p>A common subversion is for the protagonist to either shoot in a blind guess that turns out correct, or simply shoot both and see who gets madder. In both situations, the victim of the imposter is likely to be incensed that the hero couldn't tell him from his doppelganger.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Another subversion is for neither of them to be an imposter but in fact both are two parts of the same person split with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Literal Split Personality</a>.

</p><p>A more comical subversion is when the imposter looks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedLookalikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedLookalikes">nothing like the person</a> they are imitating, but people still act like they are identical, even if they haven't bothered with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Chunin Exams, two different characters use ninjutsu to disguise themselves as Naruto himself in the <em>same episode</em>, but one is identified as an imposter because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue">he was left-handed</a> (his throwing knife holder was on the wrong side), and the other reveals himself as a fake by repeating a long, complicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword">Trust Password</a> that the <em>real</em> Naruto would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay">never be able to remember</a>.
</li><li> During the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fourth Shinobi War</span> an army of Zetsu clones disguise themselves as members of the army, even faking their chakra, and start picking off the enemy. Some are spotted based on mistakes in their cover identity, but ultimately only Naruto can identify them <em>en masse</em> due to his ability to sense their evil intent.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, a woman who has obsessively studied Pazu has a duplicate of his cyborg body made and her brain put into it; the two then fight and one ends up dead; the incident is not brought up for the rest of the series, implying that either the real Pazu won, or the fake was so good that she simply took his place. Judicious use of the pause button, combined with paying <em>very careful</em> attention to details such as wounds inflicted at the start of the fight (when viewers still know which Pazu is the real one), make it clear that the real Pazu won the fight. However, the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">lets you figure it out for yourself</a> instead of spelling it out for you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, the party is confronted by a group of doppelgangers that have appeared in their image (based on each others' perceptions). Laios is the only one that is above suspicion, as all his doppelgangers look obviously fake. Through a process of elimination, they manage to narrow down the other clones to only a few options, but for the final ones, Laios decides they should all cook food to show that they're the real ones.
</li><li> <em>Mazinger</em>:
<ul><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Dr. Hell fabricates a robot seems just like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">The Professor</a> Yumi. However it was quickly identified by Sayaka when she noticed the imposter's nails were black. Dr. Hell used that strategy more times, creating a robot looked right like a secondary character and going as far as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">building a robot resembled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Kouji</span>. They also were spotted sooner or later.
</li><li> That plot was partially reused in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em> episode. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Baron Ashura kidnapped Prof. Yumi and disguised himself like him. Sayaka suspected him nearly right away, though, because he tossed a birthday gift into a trash bin, and she told others her father would never do that.
</li></ul></li><li> Something similar occurs in the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Die</a></em>'s OVA. By paying attention, it's possible to note that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "real" Miss Deep is the winner</span> before it's revealed as part of the plot.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, Yuusuke is told that one of his friends is an imposter, and he must identify the impostor by punching them. He correctly chooses Kuwabara, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDidYouKnowIDidnt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDidYouKnowIDidnt">but then reveals that he'd simply chosen the suspect who'd be best able to cope with being punched in the face</a> (they're rivals who punch each other on a regular basis). And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">the one who'd most likely fall into the trap allowing an impostor to appear in the first place</a>.
</li><li> Again the split was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>, when Urd was split into her Demon and Goddess parts. Made easier when it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Skuld had secretly put a mark on the goddess Urd.</span>
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior">Rockman.EXE Beast</a></em>, an evil alternate version of Numberman shows up infiltrating the core group of friends. When the normal universe's Numberman arrives, obligatory hilarity ensues as the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearfulSymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearfulSymmetry">attack each other identically</a>, to such an extent that their <em>Dice Bombs</em> roll the same number. The problem is solved when it's realized that if they attack both Numbermen, the fake one would be forced to shapeshift, and then all present <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> can hit him at once. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0kwky');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0kwky" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0kwky');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> However the evil Numberman has a different color scheme and is clearly wearing a symbol of the Gregia faction instead of Numberman's usual insignia, so there's no reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedLookalikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedLookalikes">they shouldn't have known he was fake the instant they saw him</a>.</span>
</li><li> A variant occurs during the Frieza saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Captain Ginyu uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">a last ditch move</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">that puts his mind in Goku's healthy, stronger body,</a> while Goku's mind is stuck in Ginyu's injured form. The real Goku has to convince Gohan and Krillin what has happened when they attack him in Ginyu's body.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em>, Poisonny impersonates Honoka at one point. When Nagisa has to pick the correct Honoka, all she can come up with is to ask them what her (Nagisa's) favorite food was, which is a question that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">has some problems</a>. The Honokas proceeded to switch off saying accurate (and, for a time, increasingly negative) things about Nagisa, until the real one finally remembered that only <em>she</em> could read the diary in which Nagisa wrote that "my socks are a little smelly," a quotation that confused the fake. (The episode featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> in the form of a perfume Honoka had made earlier in science club — as both Honokas pointed out, having or wearing the perfume proved nothing, because the fake could have just stolen the bottle.)
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mustang and Hawkeye</span> are confronting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Envy. Envy pretends to be Mustang in front of Hawkeye. However, after a brief exchange, she points her gun at him and says she knows he's not Mustang because he was calling her Lieutenant, while the real Mustang always calls her Riza when it's just the two of them. Envy expresses surprise that the two of them are that close, at which point she tells him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe">she was lying</a>, but he'd already given himself away</span>.

<ul><li> In "Will the Real Oak Stand Up?", with James from Team Rocket being the impostor. Interestingly, James was eventually discovered as the impostor not because he played his part badly but because he played his part too <em>well</em>: they were having a poetry contest, and James came up with overly-flowery poems to impress the judges. The poems were good, but they weren't even close to Professor Oak's <em>actual</em> poems, which were typically only two or three lines but contained a "hidden lesson" that was absent from James' poetry.

However, in one Tournament Arc, Jesse tried disguising herself as Nurse Joy (there were several Joys at the stadium to handle the massive number of Pokémon) and Brock smelled a rat quickly; he swoons over every Joy he meets, and could even tell them <em>apart</em> (as he explained earlier in the episode) so it was easy for him to recognize a fake Joy, it seemed.
</li><li> He's also spotted a fake Officer Jenny on at least one occasion, specifically because he only went ga-ga over the real one. That is, he <em>subconsciously</em> knew the impostor, despite being physically identical to all the other Jennies out there, was in fact simply a well-disguised man.

She gets touchy feely with Koushi when in the presence of Sanae so Sanae will not interfere with Momoko and Koushi's future marriage. The real Momoko shows up and Koushi figures the right one because Iroha is grabbing onto his arm which was just injured the previous episode and the real Momoko would know about that since she treated the injury. The real Momoko thinks the fake one is an assassin and quickly blasts her away. Iroha shows up about 5 seconds later without the disguise, but very bruised.

The Fake!Soul explains to Maka that she has to open the box to get free (allowing himself to escape) with the real Soul's voice unable to reach her to warn her of the imposter. Maka is almost convinced until she points out that he had closed the door behind her, knowing they would be trapped, and that the real Soul would've immediately warned her to leave.

Jotaro, who's just finished smoking a cigarette, claims he's figured out how: when a Stand user inhales smoke, a vein pops out on their nose. Reflexively, all the heroes put their hands to their nose to check... and so does the ship's captain.

</li><li> One time after he discovered the hero's identity (and the fact that he was Kraven the Hunter's half-brother, something which gave him his confidence back) he impersonated Spider-Man and tried to fool Mary Jane. She realized it wasn't Peter when he kissed her; as she said herself, "It made my skin crawl." (This led to what was probably the most humiliating situation in the villain's career. Spider-Man didn't need to do anything; <em>she</em> beat him senseless with a baseball bat.)
</li><li> The most humiliating might be when (after Peter revealed his identity to the world), the Chameleon infiltrated Avengers Tower as him, expertly fooling the various security scans. He then played at a dinner with Aunt May, eating some brownies and having some small talk while she knits. May then remarks about how "the real Peter only could have one or two almond brownies."

</li><li> In the final issue of a short-lived mid-70s comic named after and starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, he decided to hold the heavily-insured feline sidekick of a famous movie comedian for ransom. The comedian disguised himself as the Joker in order to retrieve it, and when the Joker's minions were faced with this trope the Joker suggested that they let the cat go and whoever it went to would <em>not</em> be him. When it went to the Joker instead, and while being arrested he protested that a cat couldn't be trained to go to someone <em>other</em> than its master, the comedian said "No cat except my million-dollar kitty!"

To prove she wasn't a Skrull, Hawkeye states a certain date, and asks Mockingbird what it meant. Turns out, Mockingbird had a miscarriage on that date and only she and Hawkeye ever knew she was even pregnant. This also served to tell Mockingbird who was under the Ronin mask.

</li><li> An early issue of the IDW reboot has him try to get into the team disguised as Snake-Eyes, only to get clocked by Duke.

It's usually just a question to pinch someone's face to check for a mask, but sometimes even that it's not enough (for example, Diabolik may have an accomplice to impersonate someone with a different corporature, or look sufficiently like someone else to use different means).
<ul><li> Other times the spotting is made more complicated by the target preventing the police from doing the face check for some idiotic reason, something that always drives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Ginko</a> mad.
</li><li> A scientist once invented a machine that could detect the presence of Diabolik's masks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">At the end of the issue, Diabolik had destroyed the machine, killed the scientist and stolen the blueprints</a>.
</li><li> One of Diabolik's impersonations was that of Walter Dorian, a rich guy who looked just like him that Diabolik replaced to have a civilian identity (upon his second arrest, the one where they found out his real face, Diabolik ditched this as useless and confessed his murder).
</li><li> Funny enough, Diabolik has been the spotting one in at least two occasions, where lookalikes hired by the mob impersonated Eva Kant to keep him distracted while they robbed him. The mob instructed the actresses to feign amnesia or being ill to justify the differences in personality that would have caused Diabolik to spot the difference at once. In the case of the fake illness, Diabolik was ultimately able to spot the imposter, but the amnesiac one was so good Diabolik <em>had no idea</em> until she confessed after learning the mob killed her lover (the surgeon that made her into an Eva lookalike).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse">Mickey Mouse Comic Universe</a> stories featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Miklos, the Grey Mouse</a> elevated this trope to an art form, as Miklos can do a <em>perfect</em> Mickey Mouse impression, and looks just like him with grey fur (hence the nickname):
<ul><li> In his debut in "Mickey's Dangerous Double" the police gets the both of them and promptly enlists Pluto, only to find him out of commission due <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">his crush on a mannequin dog</a>. They quickly asks Minnie, who first tells the right one (that the reader can recognize from the clothes) but then changes her mind. Numerous other attempts follow (including one relying on Mickey loving a cake that give a stomachache to everyone else that <em>should</em> have worked, except O'Hara got them the wrong cake, resulting in a double stomachache) until they end in a rainwater tank, at which point the Grey Mouse is unmasked thanks to him using <em>washable dye</em>;
</li><li> In "Mickey Mouse and the Grey Scourge", Mickey's friends are enlisted to try and spot the right one but they fail (with Minnie once again getting the real Mickey but getting convinced by Clarabelle it was the other), and are on the verge of a fight when Casey shows up with Pluto, who this time is <em>not</em> out of commission;
</li><li> In the 2014 story "Mickey Mouse and the Seven Boglins" Miklos has a more complex plan than usual, and for a while even <em>Mickey</em> is convinced of being the imposter (it helped he had been duped into taking fake vitamin pills that dyed his fur red and kept him unable to think straight), with the reader not being informed of which one is the fake until Minnie, once again, realizes the switch. This time, however, spotting the imposter is easy, as Minnie (who has evidently learned from the previous encounters) has tricked the fake into getting a tattoo and when comes the time to tell the right one she's quick to ask which one has it.

</li><li> When she is in someone else's form, Mystique's eyes usually flare yellow when she is tired, excited, angry, or about to shapeshift again.
<ul><li> While she can copy someone's appearance, Mystique can't replicate powers.

Perhaps justified as occasionally, Mystique lets them tell in order to get close.
</li><li> Mystique used the "Shoot us both!" move when she and the SWAT team commander she was imitating were surrounded by SWAT officers; the cops obeyed, one fell, the other didn't.

Corsair blasts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> and gloats that "these Earthers aren't so tough!" Storm immediately notes how odd a phrase that is as "Corsair was born on Earth and proud of it!" The X-Men realize these are really Skrulls and thus can cut loose.
</li><li> Visiting the mansion, Banshee is in a hallway corner when Psylocke exits Xavier's personal study. Banshee is less thrown by her being in an off-limits area than how he was able to hide in the shadows five feet away from a ninja-trained telepath. This leads to the discovery almost all the X-Men have been replaced by the Phalanax.
</li><li> More than once, Wolverine has suddenly sliced up what seems to be a normal person only to reveal it to be some sort of robot and saying "it didn't smell right." Wolverine was able to figure out the Dark Phoenix the X-Men were fighting was an illusion created by Mastermind because he <em>couldn't</em> smell her.

The first movie, competently scripted and directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a>, features an average man (Richard Benjamin) being stalked by a gunslinger robot (Yul Brynner) through a robot-filled theme park.

Late in the film, the two humans escape into the theme park and the boss robot, instead of ordering his trustworthy minions after them, <em>sends out their own robot duplicates!</em> This bit of Plot Idiocy telegraphs the movie's <em>Spot the Impostor</em> ending so ludicrously you want to shout "Oh, come onnnn!" at the TV set.

<ul><li> In the David trilogy, David morphs Jake's cousin, who is badly injured after being hit by a car and expected to die in surgery, and takes his place. Jake figures it out almost instantly, when "Saddler's" injuries are miraculously healed. Everyone else not in on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> fails miserably.
</li><li> David also impersonates Marco. When a Marco shows up, he's tested by the others: they make comments to him and see if he responds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">sarcastically</a>.
</li><li> A one-man variation in #6 when Jake gets infested by a Yeerk. The Yeerk is unable to contain its hatred of Andalites, and blows its cover for good when it protests being tied up for three days (the maximum duration Yeerks can survive without soaking up Kandrona rays), which the real Jake would instantly have agreed to.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveCussler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveCussler">Clive Cussler</a> is fond of this in several of his books. Indeed the Dirk Pitt novel <em>Iceberg</em> has several examples:
<ul><li> Pitt is recovering from a plane crash in Iceland with a local doctor when a pair of cops stop by to ask questions. They state they just had coffee with the sergeant of a local village before he went on patrol. In private, the doctor tells Pitt the men are imposters as that sergeant doesn't patrol the area and is allergic to coffee. Pitt had already noticed one of the "cops" had patches on his shoulders where a sergeant's stripes would be.
</li><li> Pitt meets with Kristi Frye, the long-hidden sister of the late explorer/researcher Kristjan Frye. Pitt is stunned when later in the book, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kristi <em>is</em> Kristjan, having undergone a sex change to be the woman she's also longed to be.</span> While he didn't expect that, Pitt does find something off and over dinner, talks of how, in New Guinea, he ordered an echidna seaweed and Kristi agrees it's a great dish. An odd reaction given how Pitt just said he had the equivalent of "a New York cut steak wrapped in porcupine quills."
</li><li> Asked how he knew something was wrong, Pitt explains that Kristi's tan was far too shallow for someone who was supposed to have spent years living in the South American jungle.
</li><li> In the novel's climax, Pitt rescues a pair of diplomats from assassins on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. Asked how he knew the killers were posing as robot pirates, Pitt quotes Walt Disney himself on "we were eyeball to eyeball and I saw the other fella blink."

<ul><li> <em>Stay Out of the Basement</em> involves a plant clone. After the clone is revealed to be a plant being, the plot seems to wrap up... until a flower in the front garden attempts to convince the protagonist that it is the real one.
</li><li> In <em>I Am Your Evil Twin</em>, the protagonist uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotAllergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotAllergy">his food allergy</a> to prove that he's not the evil clone. Unfortunately, the clone swaps the target food for a version the protagonist is not allergic to, and then vomits on purpose, successfully fooling everyone into thinking <em>he</em>'s the real thing.
</li></ul></li><li> Spoofed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a> novel <em>Matter</em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> Prince Ferbin is on the run and seeks help from a former tutor who, to verify his identity, asks him a series of questions from his studies. When he gets them all wrong, the tutor responds dryly that Ferbin is indeed his indifferent student from long ago.

Even the Company smart folk don't get suspicious, when advised to try the slots or the all-night buffet. Instead, they fear sunstroke. After Phules return, they use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the robot to drive the unwanted new CO over the edge, as he wouldn't know about its existence</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SewerGasAndElectric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SewerGasAndElectric">Sewer, Gas &amp; Electric</a></em>, Harry Gant is kidnapped and forced to compete against his robot duplicate in a video game, with his parents' lives as the stakes. His ex-wife breaks in to rescue the Gants, and the robot tries to trick her by voicing its "relief" at being "saved". She <em>immediately</em> shoots the robot, knowing that the real Harry is such a game addict that he wouldn't even notice her arrival.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune">God-Emperor of Dune</a></em> inverts this, where there's an army of impostors and the task is to spot the real one. Leto II's Fish speaker army is facing a legion of shapeshifting Face Dancers who are impersonating his general, Duncan Idaho. When he scans the crowd, he immediately spots a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault">naked one</a> among the copies.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a> book, when referring to a man who had been hospitalized, another man says, "taken to hospital", instead of "taken to <em>the</em> hospital". The former is a British term. The man has been posing as an American to escape crimes he was charged for in England.
</li><li> At least two examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheWest">Journey to the West</a></em>:
<ul><li> In chapter 39, a demon disguises himself as the Tang Monk. Sun Wukong chases down both him and the real Tang Monk, but can't tell them apart. In an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillUsBoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillUsBoth">Kill Us Both</a>, Sun Wukong asks both monks to recite the spell that will tighten the crown on the Monkey King's head. Knowing he can't do it, the imposter flees.
</li><li> Later, when two identical monkeys claim to be the Monkey King, and they take their fight to continuously more powerful divine beings, all of whom (except the last) fail to identify the real one.

The protagonist (an American volunteer in the Italian army) is arrested as a German infiltrator because he speaks Italian with an accent—as does the military policeman arresting him (as he points out to no avail) as most Italians were more familiar with their local dialect.
</li><li> Partially subverted in the first story in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <em>The Union Club Mysteries</em>, where a club member named Griswold commented that spies sent to infiltrate defense agencies in particular were recruited from among people who'd spent several years in the US and were thoroughly grounded in American trivia. He then told of how he'd unmasked one such spy whom he'd been interrogating for hours by playing a word-association game which finished with him saying "terror of flight" and the spy responding "gloom of the grave." This was a giveaway because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> both phrases are from the third stanza of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and "...no loyal, true-blue American knows the words of the third stanza of our glorious national anthem" making it much more likely that it was a spy who had studied too hard</span>.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue">Clue</a></em> mystery series stories, Professor Plum makes several clones of Miss Peacock, alike in every way, save that the clone-Peacocks always lie. They corner all of them, all acting like fuss-budgets, all claiming to be the real Peacock, and the reader is asked how to tell them apart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The answer is to ask any simple question with a non-subjective answer, like "What is 2+2?".</span>

In order to verify a character's identity, Karrin Murphy demands him to "Bleed for me." Not only does he do so without protest, he has a pin on him for such a purpose. Harry notes that, while there are a great many supernatural shapeshifters, none of them can create convincing blood. He also comments on how bad things must have gotten in the six months he's been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dead</span> for the test to have gotten so commonplace.

She knows he's the murderer who killed a doctor who was seeing through the ruse and says the tip-off was that his well-manicured hands don't match "the prodigal son who spent ten years working in the Peruvian mines," indicating he's an imposter. She urges him to turn himself in but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">he has other ideas.</a>

The "Turing Test", as it's called, is a popular challenge for A.I. programmers to try to overcome, though it isn't seriously considered a benchmark for true intelligence in a computer. <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000817043617/http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html">The original paper is available online<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for the curious.
</li><li> During the Battle of the Bulge, German troops in US Army uniform infiltrated the lines with the intent of causing sabotage and disruption. Checkpoints grilled GIs on things every true-blooded American was expected to know such as the identity of Mickey Mouse's girlfriend, baseball scores, or the capital of Illinois. This last question resulted in the brief detention of General Bradley; although he gave the correct answer (Springfield), the GI who questioned him apparently believed the capital was Chicago. Although this behavior is often ridiculed in fictional depictions of the battle, it did succeed in identifying a number of infiltrators, many of whom didn't speak fluent English or know anything about American society. There's also a legend about a German spy who was caught because he could recite the entire "Star-Spangled Banner" when no <em>true</em> American knows anything past the first verse. Other things that gave the infiltrators away were that the Germans would pack four men in a jeep and drive it with the black-out slits on the headlights. The well-equipped US troops drove one or two men per jeep, and being used to their side having air superiority didn't bother with the black-out covers.
</li><li> Similar to the above, the parts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">French Resistance</a> that helped Allied pilots back to England often quizzed the airmen they were helping. They often came across pilots who had knowledge of their unit, but none of their supposed home town, who were immediately detained as a possible mole. Once, they had a pilot who was the opposite — knew everything about his homeland, but nothing about his unit. Fortunately for him, one of the Resistance members was able to contact the RAF and established that he had been transferred there as a replacement from another unit, then immediately put on a bomber that was shot down over Europe. <br/><br/>One Allied pilot who was shot down and hidden in a barn by some locals found himself woken in the middle of the night by someone jabbing him in the gut and screaming at him in German. He reflexively protested in his native English, which served to prove to the French partisans that he was not a German spy. He reflected later on that it was fortunate that he did not reflexively reply in <em>German</em>, which he had studied in school.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> states, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">it helps if there is some handy phrase that your side can pronounce but which the enemy find difficult.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One such example is Denmarks prized porridge rødgrød. It was so hard to say that rødgrød med fløde (literally rødgrød with cream) has been used by the Danish to catch infiltrators in BOTH World Wars.
</li><li> There have been accounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> German soldiers spotting careless spies at rallies because they saluted wrong.
<ul><li> Likewise, other careless slips, such as cutting and eating a steak the wrong way.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> skit told a similar story about a German Spy in France: He was found out when he ordered a meal with a whole cooked potato.

Scene from Gravity Falls, Ep 22 - Into the Bunker. Dipper, Mabel, Wendy and Soos find a hidden underground bunker not far from the Mystery Shack which Dipper hopes will lead him to a clue on the author of the journals.

Dipper thinks he's found her, but the real one soon arrives and a struggle ensues between the original and fake, leaving it to Dipper to try to determine who's the former.	</p>
