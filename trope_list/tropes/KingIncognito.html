</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em> plays a double case of this with Mashiro and Takumi both sneaking out be among the general population and unknowingly meeting up with each other while their bodyguards try to keep up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>.
<ul><li> The prequel <em>Sifr</em> features a male example.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em>, Shoryuu the Emperor of En does this a lot. He claims that listening to gossip in <em>brothels</em> is a good way to find out what's really going on. It seems to work.
<ul><li> Also, the recently crowned Yoko goes on a sabbatical like this early on to familiarize herself with her empire. She ends up joining a revolt against her own government (which had become choked with corruption before her ascension).
</li></ul></li><li> Hotohori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> is always doing this.

<ul><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his half-brother Tendou, who <em>would</em> have been the successor to the throne if not for a) his parents fearing for his safety and sending him away and b) Hotohori's overbearing mother pushing <em>him</em> onto the throne instead) lives as a peasant and even shared a relationship with the woman who later became Hotohori's wife.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Used absurdly straight in <em>Moetan</em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> Dandy is revealed to be the King of the vaguely defined Magical Kingdom all along. Ridiculously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shounen">shounen</a> battles ensue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles">Rose of Versailles</a></em>, Queen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> tries to go to a party incognito (just not revealing she's the queen since she's still clearly a noble in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">Pimped-Out Dress</a>), but her bodyguard Oscar just has to challenge the guy chatting her up. And so began another one of the series' sources of drama.
</li><li> Lelouch, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. Slight subversion in that he's only a prince, and not even close to being the crown prince. (He's 17th in line for the throne, at least he is at the beginning of the series.)
<ul><li> It runs in the family. At the series' beginning, he lives with his sister, a princess. As well, Euphie meets Suzaku whilst pretending to be a commoner so she can see the settlement.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a> </em> franchise has several cases of Princess Incognito, with the Cures who are princesses of the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">fairy kingdom</a> going to school as normal students and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">walking around in public without batting an eye</a>. The royal characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">Hime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegalRinglets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegalRinglets">Towa</a> also stand out from the other students by having longer, more colorful, and "upper-class" hairstyles.
</li><li> Happens frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories">The Five Star Stories</a></em>. It's a favorite activity of Emperor Amaterasu, but then, disguising yourself is the easiest thing in the world to do when you're a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">divine emperor</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K: Return of Kings</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tenkei Iwafune</span> was actually the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Grey</span> King, who was believed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">to be dead</a>. He didn't want to be a King anymore after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Kagutsu Crater</span> happened, so he hid his identity and supported the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Green</span> King.
</li><li> Shi Ryuuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a></em> does this a lot. Not that he always succeeds; Shuurei saw through his disguise immediately when they first met (he was using the name of someone she had met not ten minutes ago, among other things). He does manage to pull it off at other times, though - at least once so well that when he reveals his identity, his subjects don't initially <em>believe</em> him.
</li><li> Ling Yao and May Chang in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, although in May's case, being the emperor's daughter doesn't really get her all that much. Ling on the other hand is such a dork that when the other characters find out who he is, they picture him in pantaloons with a white horse and a shiny crown and almost injure themselves laughing. It's mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, even if the falling-over-and-demanding-food thing is later Ling's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay">Something Only They Would Say</a> in a plot-relevant way.
</li><li> The fifth episode of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> is essentially an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomanHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomanHoliday">Roman Holiday</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">manga adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, Link, during his trip to Hyrule Castle Town, meets a little girl and plays with her all day (including going on a semi-disastrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Bombchu Bowling</a> excursion). She's actually Princess Zelda, of course, who snuck out of the castle to have some fun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a>, Arslan is hoping to get some information out of some prisoners his forces recently captured, so he disguises himself as a servant and arranges things so that he gets assigned to deliver food to each of the prisoners he's most interested in.

</li><li> King Matthias the Just (aka Matthias Corvinus) of Hungary has hundreds of tales depicting him as this, using it to expose corrupt lords or to learn about the problems of his people. One example: He was incognito in his birth town of Kolozsvár (today Cluj Napoca/Cluj, Romania), and was just sitting on a bench minding his business, when a gendarme came along and, taking him for a poor local, forced him to come along to the mayor's house where the mayor forced him and many other locals work for him cutting and piling up firewood without rest and, at the end of the day, without pay. The next day Matthias came along in full royal regalia and pomp, and when he mentioned he heard of abuses from the mayor's part, the mayor denied it. Matthias pointed to one of the heaps of firewood, which his entourage checked out to find entirely of logs marked with Matthias' name written with soot (Matthias having done the marking the day before.) The mayor was arrested on the spot.
</li><li> Popular tales about Polish king Casimir III the Great ascribe him the habit of wandering in beggar's disguise and asking for food. After such a visit he always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ErmineCapeEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ErmineCapeEffect">re-visited said people with his whole court</a> and revealing the results of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">previous test</a> to public. The most popular version involves the king visiting a mean noble who mocked his poverty and a poor peasant who shared his last loaf of bread with a stranger and asking him to come to the baptism of his child. The following Sunday, the king's carriage stopped by the knight's castle just to warn him about underestimating people and then the king, with his whole court in tow, come to the peasant's cottage and throw a party to celebrate the peasant's son's baptism. The king becomes one of the child's godfathers, promises to take care of the whole family, and gives them a loaf of bread in exchange for the one that he had eaten before. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateReward">It was made of pure gold </a>.

Paperarello (derived from Italian <em>papera</em> meaning "gosling") is the nickname given to him.
</li><li> In Chinese folklore, famous government officials (especially ones well known for a strong sense of justice) were said to disguise themselves in plainclothes to better <strike> spy</strike> understand the people he was ruling over. This is also a very common thread in Arabian or Islamic folktales, too.
</li><li> The Jewish folktale "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSwordOfWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSwordOfWood">The Sword Of Wood</a>" has a king visit a cobbler without him knowing who he is.

</li><li> A story goes that Napoleon was wandering around his army's camp incognito and saw an officer carving a sword blade out of wood and gluing it to the hilt before putting it back in the scabbard. When asked about it, the officer replied that he'd lost the blade in battle but could not afford to have it replaced, so he would content himself with the wooden one until he had saved up enough. The next day, a soldier was sentenced to death by beheading, with the officer ordered to do the deed. Sweating bullets, the officer called out "Lord, if this man is truly innocent, let this sword of mine turn to wood!" and drew his sword. Naturally, the soldier was spared, and the officer found a brand-new (metal) sword in his tent that evening with a congratulatory note signed "N.".

He overhears three sisters discussing their "If I could have one wish" fantasies, in which one says she'd marry the Sultan's chief baker, the next says she'd marry the chief cook, and the youngest says, "Nothing less than the Sultan himself" - so the Sultan decides to make their wishes come true.
</li><li> According to these stories, caliph Harun al-Rashid also liked to do this. He wasn't necessarily good at it, though, nearly getting himself killed in <em>The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad</em> for asking nosy questions while forgetting they didn't know who he was.

A character introduced as a Blue Priest eventually turns out to be none other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the archnoble leading the duchy</span>, who chose that false identity precisely so he could walk among commoners with a little more ease that what his real status would allow for.

Except when forced to ride around in expensive robes, wearing a heavy crown, he prefers wearing simple white linen - both when travelling and when dealing with the day-to-day work of being Emperor of Mallorea. As a result, no-one ever recognises when he does travel around the city. When he joins Garion's group, the last thing they want is to have Zakath recognised at every turn but, because of his usual spartan style, they don't have much to work with. When they conclude that the main problem will be the fact his face is stamped onto every single coin in the empire, the only change he ends up making to his appearance to make it even harder to recognise him is... to grow a beard.

In true <em>Catch-22</em> fashion, this backfires spectacularly: once the other players realize that it's their commanding officer in disguise, they play even <em>rougher</em> with him, knowing that they can get away with abusing him by pretending they didn't recognize him afterwards.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfPrydain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfPrydain">Chronicles of Prydain</a></em>:
<ul><li> Prince Gwydion and Fflewddur Fflam both travel around the countryside in simple traveling garb. Both cases are heavily subverted, though. The protagonist of the series, Taran, recognizes Gwydion within minutes of meeting him and is actually shocked and disappointed to not find him in more regal attire. Gwydion uses it as a lesson to not judge others by their appearance alone. Fflewddur, meanwhile, makes a point out of boasting how he is a king (of a rather small kingdom, but a king nonetheless), thereby voiding the "Incognito" portion of "King Incognito".
</li><li> Princess Eilonwy, on the other hand, plays the trope completely straight. She introduces herself as "Eilonwy daughter of Angharad," and Taran spends the entire first novel thinking she's a foundling peasant not unlike himself. It's only on literally the last page that his master, Dallben, casually mentions that she's actually royalty. Her title becomes a plot point in the third book.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCinderSpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCinderSpires">The Cinder Spires</a></em>: At one point, a shabbily dressed tea house patron is unthinkingly rude to Gwendoline. She instantly demands either an apology or a duel. Benedict has to introduce her to "His Majesty Addison Orson Magnus Jeremiah Albion, First Citizen and Spirearch of Albion". Addison is quick to claim that he has very little real power anymore and just likes the tea shop and its owners. However, for all his protests that his position is obsolete and merely formal, he has no difficulty in wielding large amounts of power and influence behind the scenes.

</li><li> The First Lord Gaius Sextus does this whenever he feels like delivering a message personally. It's actually justified since having powerful watercrafting allows him to shapeshift. It then gets subverted in that Tavi and Marcus see right through it despite the shapeshifitng, because they know the First Lord's mannerisms and body language and the First Lord fails to change them when he's incognito.
</li><li> Princeps Septimus, son of First Lord Gaius Sextus, is revealed to have dressed below his station a few times to tour the camps he commanded. As a man who regularly defended the weak from the upper class and magically powerful nobles, he found many people to help. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He saves two women who are being mistreated and offers them to work in his private area of the camp and even weds one of them out of love.</span>
</li><li> One noblewoman, Invidia Aquitaine, gives her husband Attis a dancing slave girl as an anniversary present. He gives the girl to one of his servants, Fidelias, for the night, as a reward for some services rendered. Once they're alone, Fidelias reveals he figured out she was Invidia. They discuss business and she says she's going to sleep with him anyway, as ordered. Ironically, Aquitaine makes a remark about what his wife might say if she were there, and Fidelias concurred, though he had already figured it out by that point.

However, it does give King Arthur a positive moment, when he knowingly exposes himself to infection by carrying a smallpox-stricken child to die in the arms of her equally ill mother.
</li><li> During the Time of Troubles arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry">Deverry</a></em> novels, in order to reach Cerrmorr in his (ultimately successful) attempt to gain control of that faction of the civil war, Prince Maryn has to travel through territory held by the rival Cantrae faction.

</li><li> In the short story "The Fable of the Three Princes" by Isaac Asimov it's the Emperor's Daughter who does this. When foreign princes come to undergo trials to impress her and win her hand, she always disguises herself as a serving maid (she's a powerful sorceress) assigned to them as a way to judge their true characters as well as a way of finding someone who would love her for her and not her title or inheritance (she's the Emperor's only child). This is how the youngest Prince wins her affection, by being kind to the serving maid and telling the undisguised Emperor's Daughter (he doesn't realize they're the same person) that he intends to wed said serving maid.

In two episodes, he actually takes up the latter option, though unlike most examples, it's not so much a secret test of character for the people he meets, but an example of Kirkman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>. In both times this method was used, Kirkman wants to thank people doing difficult tasks for the nation without the media commentary (in the first case, cleaning up the wreckage of the Capitol Building, which the latter way ended in a media disaster for him. In the second case, he was thanking a commando team who was conducting a raid on a terrorist involved in the bombing of the Capitol Building and offering sympathies for a fallen teammate.). Dialog reveals that Kirkman's predecessor did the same thing on one occasion where he attended his estranged son's concert in private, wishing to hear his son play without the media frenzy the president's visit would entail. Kirkman implies that the previous President also donned a cap and jacket and got away with it.

</li></ul></li><li> King Solomon, of Jewish history/mythology, was said to have been thrown down from his throne and replaced by a demon impostor. He was forced to roam the land as a commoner, so rather than by choice, this one was against his will.
</li><li> The prophet Elijah favored this trick, doing it willingly to gauge the temper of the Israelite people. On the other hand, he was often forced to do it (he was hunted by King Ahab, so he <em>had</em> to hide).

<ul><li> It features this in 2 Choronicles 18:28. Ahab, the king of Israel at the time, disguised himself in battle against Ramoth-gilead. He had Jehosaphat put on royal regalia instead. Ahab's intention was to avoid being killed despite the fact Michaiah the Prophet explicitly stated that he would be and that God had in fact put a lying spirit in the mouths of Ahab's prophets to entice him to enter battle and die. The disguise doesn't work long. Ahab is killed.
</li><li> Saul also disguised himself upon going to see the witch of Endor. The woman is reluctant to conjure the dead for him and explains that Saul would put her to death for practicing witchcraft. When Saul asks for her to conjure up Samuel however, she realizes who it is she's talking to.

Taken literally, the protagonist keeps encountering a beggar, who they don't know the name of, in various perilous situations (starving, collapsed from dehydration, stuck outside in a blizzard, wounded from assault next to the road) and showing hospitality to him at considerable personal expense. It ends with the beggar falsely accused on death row, and the protagonist futilely trying to argue his innocence. The beggar asks the protagonist if they would be willing to die if that would mean the beggar would be freed and, when the protagonist says that they would, the beggar unmasks himself as Jesus and congratulates the protagonist. However, the hymn is a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Matthew 25:40</a>, which says that service to people who are in need is service to Jesus, and therefore usually understood as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">allegorical</a>.

For whatever reason (possibly pride) Eirin doesn't tell her the truth: in reality, <em>Tewi</em> is the master of the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, where Eientei was built. <em>Tewi</em> is the leader of all the youkai Earth Rabbits, who only serve as Eientei's servants because Tewi tells them to and wouldn't listen to the Lunarians at all otherwise. Furthermore, <em>Tewi</em> is basically treating the Lunarians as tenants; she approached them long ago with the deal that she and her rabbits would help the exiles hide from the whole world, so long as the Lunarians shared their knowledge with Tewi. Ergo, it's not the Lunarians who tolerate Tewi running around freely in Eientei; it's <em>Tewi</em> who tolerates <em>them</em>.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Eirin:</strong> It was clear that Tewi wasn't just a normal youkai rabbit. All the earth rabbits listened to everything she said.

<ul><li> Emperor Kangxi was famous for doing this. As was his grandson, Qianlong. In fact, these visits spawned a gesture still found in southern China. Qianlong tended to serve his companions tea and do other little things. A person receiving such a huge honour would have compelled themselves to kowtow (a deep, kneeling bow where one's head touches the ground) to show their gratitude, but in doing so it would have blown Emperor's cover. In order to keep his identity secret, they developed a more discreet way to say "thank you": tapping the table several times with the knuckles or fingers, also known as the "finger kowtow". This eventually became a common gesture for thanking anyone for pouring tea, especially in southern China.
</li><li> King Frederik VIII (1906-12) of Denmark died suddenly on a street in Hamburg while travelling under an alias, and had to be located by the director of the hotel where he stayed and sneaked out of the public morgue by his servants. Since the place where his body was found was very close to a high-class bordello, this immediately led to scandalous rumours about the circumstances of Frederik's death.
</li><li> Several Swedish kings have done this, particularly in The House of Vasa:
<ul><li> King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Gars.</a>
</li><li> King Charles XI. According to folklore, his disguise was a simple grey cloak, which he would throw aside to show his royal garb at the right dramatic moment - earning him the nickname <em>Gråkappan</em>, The Grey Cloak. This was likely inspired by the stories of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Óðinn's</a> penchant for incognito wanderings, and King Gylfi's disguise as Gangleri as recounted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProseEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProseEdda">Prose Edda</a></em>, which also inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Gandalf's</a> design.
</li><li> The first King Gustavus. Although he did it, allegedly, while trying to escape imprisonment and execution as a rebellious noble outlaw, but still...
</li><li> After abdicating, Christina of Sweden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">dressed as a man</a> and traveled through Europe.
</li><li> After being forced to abdicate, Gustaf IV Adolf settled down in Switzerland under the name Colonel Gustafsson.
</li><li> Played (sorry) with by Gustaf V, who was a keen tennis player, but obviously couldn't officially compete under his royal title, so he would use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SueDonym" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SueDonym">Sue Donym</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Mr. G.</a>
</li><li> His son, King Gustaf VI Adolf (r. 1950-73) was a noted archaeologist, specialising in pre-Roman Italian history, especially Etruscan history (he's often called an Etruscologist as a result). Naturally, he kept a low profile whenever going off to digs in Northern Italy—don't want anyone to know that the King of Sweden is getting his hands dirty digging up old bits of Italian pottery and bone!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a> of Russia spent several years on tour of Western Europe, often going incognito as an ordinary worker to learn the skills he wanted to take home. It's said that he never fooled anybody since he took a posse around with him. It's also said no one was fooled because Peter the Great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">was 6'8"</a> and people that large aren't common today, much less during Peter's time. And that he paid them well enough everyone pretended to not notice.
</li><li> It is said that the Doges of Venice had permanent reservations at various establishments as places where they go incognito, as for a Doge to just go out for a drink like a normal person was considered unfitting to the City's dignity.
<ul><li> ...While one Polish king did leave his chambers frequently, go out for a drink incognito, get into barfights, and do similar funny (if unkingly) stuff.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II</a> has done this a few times.
<ul><li> She did this recently, to enjoy a trip on a steam train.
</li><li> On V-E Day after the defeat of Germany, Elizabeth - then a Princess - and her sister Margaret wandered amongst the celebrating crowds anonymously.
</li><li> She once did this unintentionally; while vacationing at Balmoral, she was on a walk in plainclothes with a security guard when she ran into a family of American tourists, who, not recognizing her, asked her for directions. During their chat, they asked if she'd ever met "the Queen", to which she replied she hadn't but the security guard close by had. In the same conversation, she was asked what brought her there that day and answered with that "(she has) a house very close by".
</li><li> Another time at Balmoral, she ran into a local, who, not recognizing her, commented on her resemblance to herself, to which she only replied "How reassuring".
</li></ul></li><li> Queen Elizabeth II's mother, also Elizabeth, did this. As documented on the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrown2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrown2016">The Crown (2016)</a></em>, she went on a holiday to stay with some friends in as far north Scotland as one can go. There, not dressed in any formal wear but suited for the cold windy days, she meets the owner of a neighboring castle and while he thinks she looks familiar cannot place where he might know her from. She doesn't inform him of the truth in order to maintain their developing friendship. She is only found out when Prime Minister Churchill sends an aide to bring her back early and he calls out her title in front of the man.
</li><li> There was both a Bourbon Prince and a Bonaparte prince who served in the Free French Foreign Legion during World War Two, as both their families were officially forbidden French citizenship for fear that they might cause a succession crisis. Specifically, France has been a republic since the (Bonapartist) 2nd French Empire ended in September 1870, and there was worry that such princes might try to stir up a movement to restore either the Kingdom or the Empire.
</li><li> Empress Elizabeth of Austria (also known as Sisi) had the habit of traveling under a pseudonym such as the Countess of Hohenembs. It caused a great deal of trouble for a lot of people when she decided to drop in unannounced on her royal relatives (something absolutely <em>unheard of</em> in those times) with only her lady-in-waiting in tow, and got herself arrested until they returned home and identified her. She also had the habit of going on extensive walking tours and hikes, and demanded to sleep in whichever pretty villa she found when she got tired. She was once chased away from a villa by an umbrella-wielding old woman who did not recognize her. Her exasperated husband, Emperor Franz Josef, even wrote to her that she deserved it because she shouldn't just walk into people's homes like that. For her part, Elizabeth found both incidents amusing and was very understanding of the reactions she witnessed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero">Nero</a> was said to have done this and gone around beating people up (and robbing them), in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a> that everyone saw through but could do nothing about. After one senator beat him up anyway, he started having bodyguards follow at a distance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionHeart">Richard I, the Lionheart</a>, traveled incognito after returning from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a>, trying to escape capture (he wasn't successful).
</li><li> Neither was King Louis XVI of France when he tried to escape from France as a servant travelling with a large party (actually his family). He was stopped in Varennes, allegedly because someone recognized him with his portrait on a coin.
</li><li> King Henry V of England. He used the pseudonym "Harry Leroy" which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Incredibly Lame Pun</a> on two accounts - "Harry" is colloquial for Henry and <em>le Roi</em> means "king" in French.
</li><li> James V of Scotland was said to wander his kingdom as "the Guidman of Ballangeich". ("Guidman" = "Goodman" = "Mister".) For this, he was known as "the King of the Commons."
</li><li> As mentioned above, Haroun Al-Raschid.
</li><li> Also, probably in direct imitation, Abbas the Great of Persia.
</li><li> Haroun al-Rashid was actually following the tradition of Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second Caliph, who was famous for touring whatever city he was in (usually Medina) by night more or less to check its pulse and particularly to see that nobody was being cheated and that the city's poorest weren't <em>too</em> poor (if they were, the Islamic pillar of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Zakat</a></em>—either charity or a poor-tax depending on whom you ask—wasn't working). Umar himself was famous for living the simple life, generally wearing a shabby, patched robe and giving away nearly all his (colossal) income towards the relief of war orphans.
</li><li> After the Battle of Worcester Charles II spent six weeks attempting to flee the country, dressing as a regular citizen as he did so. He did usually have allies with him, who would help him move on and point to who could help him (including many Catholics, hence his general appreciation toward them later - and deathbed conversion), but he also had to stand up to scrutiny to those not in the know and occasionally be almost by himself, even talking with Commonwealth supporters about that rogue Charles Stuart. He is said to have seen the time as quite character-making for him.
</li><li> King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands once participated in a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfstedentocht">legendary 200-kilometer ice-skating endurance race<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while he was Crown Prince under the pseudonym W. A. van Buren. After a while he got recognized; both Queen Beatrix and his father were present when he finished.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/18/528946937/dutch-king-reveals-secret-life-as-part-time-pilot-on-klm-airline?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20170518">He also has had a part-time job as an airline pilot for KLM for over two decades,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> flying the Fokker 70, and is training for the Boeing 737. He has stated that most people don't recognize him when he's in uniform and that when he gives the pre-flight safety briefings, most people don't even pay any attention to him, though sometimes people mention that they've heard the co-pilot's voice somewhere before.
</li></ul></li><li> Sigismund of Luxemburg loved doing this. He preferred having fun over his kingly duties and often snuck out dressed as a commoner whenever he wanted to party.
</li><li> Mathias Corvinus would occasionally travel dressed as a commoner. Rumours also claim he did some vigilante work this way. One particular story even made him into a thief, due to a fortune teller telling him that he will die the following day if he doesn't break into somebody's house - he broke into the home of one of his advisors and came across a conspiracy to assassinate him.
</li><li> There is a story about the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII - a hotel in Swanage, Dorset (England) claims that he traveled incognito without a retinue and arrived at the hotel only to find it full. They managed to find him a couch to sleep on - and he never let on that he was the son of Queen Victoria. That was, of course, in the days before even illustrated newspapers could print photographs of anyone, including the royal family.
<ul><li> While still Prince of Wales, he also quite regularly traveled on the continent under the alias "Baron Renfrew"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note42ez7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note42ez7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note42ez7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One of his actual subsidiary titles, though not widely known.</span> which was a semi-subversion/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a> - it was an "official incognito" meant as a designation that he is travelling as a (noble) private person, not as an heir to the British throne, thus sparing him (and countries he visited) any official ceremonies, not a complete concealment of his identity.
</li></ul></li><li> King Bansah, a King of several tribes from Ghana works in an automobile repair shop in Germany. (Note: He also worked there before he became king. He became king because, after the death of his predecessor, he was the only one of his family who could become the king according to law. So, this is also partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance">Unexpected Inheritance</a>. After he became king, he wanted to continue life as a commoner, and so, he stayed in Germany living a normal life while doing his work as a king.)
</li><li> Prince Harry, younger son of Charles and Diana, once came as close to this trope as he could ever get in this day and age by participating in a "homeless for a day" event with a load of other volunteers. The half-dozen MIBs loitering at a discreet distance probably didn't improve the already dubious authenticity of the stunt.
<ul><li> He's somewhat more successful at this in his Army career, given that everyone in a helmet and camouflage looks the same.
<ul><li> One newspaper revealed the secret of where one of the Princes was serving and was harshly criticized by people who pointed out that not only were they putting his life at risk, but they were also risking the lives of the other people in his unit. And, in fact, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2445326/Prince-Harry-Taliban-murder-plot-revealed-tried-capture-kill-royal-Afghanistan.html">Harry was a priority target<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. They somewhat remedied this by making him a helicopter pilot. Since helicopters are high-priority targets regardless, it didn't matter at all if the guy piloting it was royalty or not.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Doing this can have embarrassing results. During a visit to the theatre in the 1920s, King Alfonso XIII of Spain was unceremoniously pushed aside by a deputy mayor's bodyguard that didn't recognize him. One can only imagine his face when he got told.
</li><li> Alfonso XIII's grandson, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, likes to motorbike incognito around the Spanish countryside.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5mz6c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5mz6c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5mz6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He's not king anymore, having abdicated in favor of his son for a nice retirement.</span> There are several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> about His Majesty bringing fuel to fellow bikers who'd run out on lonely roads.
</li><li> In 1755, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> of Prussia traveled to the Netherlands pretending to be a musician of the king of Poland. He was not recognized by Swiss student Henri de Catt, who was quite surprised to be invited to the court in Potsdam and asked to serve as reader to the king.
</li><li> It was not uncommon for monarchs to travel under an "official incognito" that everybody knew in order to forego elaborate and time-consuming ceremonies, calling-out of guards of honour, etc. Czar Alexander I of Russia, for instance, travelled as the Comte du Nord (Count of the North, since Russia at the time was seen as the great Northern, not Eastern power), while Prussian kings would go as the Count of Ruppin (actually one of their many lesser titles). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a> Joseph II traveled abroad as Count von Falkenstein.
<ul><li> Similar things are done in some military units, particularly in Special Operations. The commanding officer of a larger military unit may receive a visit from his "father" or "brother", and the CO will treat his "father" or "brother" to a tour of the base. Of course, the "relative" is actually a senior officer or high-ranking civilian official, and, as in above, the masquerade is done to streamline the visit from the ceremony required by a senior officer or high-ranking civilian official visiting, particularly if the unit's mission(or very existence) is classified.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain celebrities, particularly those in British Indie music, can pass pretty much unnoticed in public, as from a distance they look like anyone else (short hair, plain clothes, etc). It is not uncommon for fans of the band to not notice them until realising a sort while later who it was. Conversely, world-famous people with a distinctive appearance (e.g. the late Michael Jackson) have been seen in public with very conspicuous disguises that make them more noticeable than if they went out plain clothed.
<ul><li> A lot of celebrities do this, for various reasons (comfort in their personal life compared to the sometimes painful high-fashion looks they frequently wear, hiding from the paparazzi, etc.,) can sometimes dress not just simply, but often kinda shabby. It's led to the joke that sometimes people who are poor often dress beyond their means to look wealthy, whereas the rich and famous, by contrast, will dress like they're homeless.
</li></ul></li><li> Supposedly, when Dolly Parton wants to make sure Dollywood is being run the way she likes at ground level, she goes out without makeup and wearing a muumuu.
</li><li> Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah (1477-1488) of Malacca was famous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">regularly going undercover at night to check on the well-being of his people</a>. He was even rumored to have once chased after a thief on one such occasion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disneyland</a> at least once a week disguised as a tourist to check out the park and make sure everything was working smoothly. Despite the fact that he hosted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">a TV show</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">apparently nobody recognized him once he put on a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses</a>. When he hired Disneyland's upper management, he made it clear that he didn't want them sitting behind desks all day—he wanted them in the park, riding the attractions they'd overseen the construction of, eating the food, and talking with guests about how their day is going.
</li><li> A Belgian monarch is reported to have attended a performance of Le Petomane, a flatulist, incognito at Paris' Moulin Rouge.
</li><li> Emperor Akihito of Japan has a vacation home in Nagano prefecture and has been known to visit local farmers incognito to buy fresh produce.
</li><li> Secret shoppers at retail chains are a form of this.
</li><li> More recently, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBXV-LXzeig">Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg played taxi driver for a Friday<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>One passenger</strong>: When I see you from behind, you look a lot like Stoltenberg.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope Francis</a> has been known to go out at night dressed as a parish priest and help the needy and homeless.
</li><li> Benito Mussolini tried this while attempting to escape into the Alps, he disguised himself as a private, although he left his striped General's trousers uncovered. However, at Dongo, he was arrested by Partisans and hanged.
</li><li> A less pleasant version of the trope on par with Nero's above was practiced by Philip IV of Spain, who would dress like a commoner and sneak into nobles' houses <em>to sleep with their wives</em>. Most were aware of that, but pretended not to, to not get in trouble with him. This worked until one day, when one noble actually didn't like the idea, and instead grabbed a cane and hit the king until he ran him out of his home, acting like he had not recognized him and treating him like he would with a common burglar. The king never tried to identify himself during the incident, nor took any action against the noble. Recognizing that he was sleeping with his subjects' wives was more shameful than actually doing it.
</li><li> After participating in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> panel at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaisieWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaisieWilliams">Maisie Williams</a> (Arya Stark) later joined the crowd at Comic-Con, wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> mask <a class="urllink" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/maisie-williams-managed-to-go-unnoticed-at-comic-con-thanks#4bx3ssm">so she could tour the convention floor without being recognized.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> did the same with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Bart Simpson</a> mask.

Though he announces #AdamIncognito on Twitter before he sets out, and has prizes (often tickets to his panel) for anyone who can identify him.
</li></ul></li><li> A disguised Henry VIII and several courtiers met Anne of Cleves after she arrived in England but before she arrived in court. Henry was hoping to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> as per the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove">Courtly Love</a> tropes of the day, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness">unfortunately no-one tipped off the German princess</a>, so she gave this strange overweight man who was making advances the cold shoulder. It was not an auspicious start.
</li><li> In the early years of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> (back when it was called the World Wrestling Federation), Vince Mcmahon in his younger days was known as a color commentator and interviewer. It wasn't until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewJob">Montreal Screw Job</a>, that people found out he was the owner and CEO of the whole operation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> head booker Gabe Sapolsky worked as the commentator "Jimmy Bowers" while owner of RF Video, ROH's initial parent company, Rob Feinstein acted as a cheerleading type manager to The Christopher Street Connection, going by "Fun Athletic Guy". Cary Silkin, the eventual owner who did away with the two founders to save their creation, was the only one who didn't use an alias, although he also didn't publicly reveal who he was, preferring to just watch the show rather than take part in or credit for it, until circumstance kind of forced him to take the reigns.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a> were believed to do this in The Trafford Centre between 2008 and 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to people who work in the centre</a>. But it isn't just them - there's also reports of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> (during the Tom Hiddleston relationship), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix">Beth Phoenix</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a> having been there amongst the thousands of shoppers. During 2014, one motorist <em>claimed</em> that Taylor Swift tried to steal his parking space, making this trope questionable in the case of Taylor.
