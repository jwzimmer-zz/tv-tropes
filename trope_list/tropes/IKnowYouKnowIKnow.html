</p><p><em>"Yes, but if they know I know they know, they may do (X) instead. But what if they know more than I think they know? They could be acting like they only know that I know they know, when in fact they know that I know they know I know they know!"</em>

</p><p>Something of an overblown version of the classic chess axiom "think three moves ahead", this is one of the most common sights in a duel of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmasters</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> may also have them, as the level of paranoia necessary to pull one off suggests he's suspecting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">everyone</a></em> of knowing and reacting accordingly. Of course, if there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> in the making, that attitude might be justified...
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>May not feature the exact line, but often uses a scene where one character or the other remarks on how their opponent would react if they knew, and what they're doing in case that happens. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, humans are capable of keeping track of many degrees of what people know ("I know that he knows that she knows that they know that we know about the party..."), though even when taking the game seriously, they tend to find the string of "knowing" comical.
</p><p>I Know You Know I Know breaks down logically, and it obeys some rules. Here are the levels of deception, with examples:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Level 0</strong>: absolute honesty, no deception.
</li><li> <strong>Level 1</strong>: X plays level 1 (hereafter abbreviated X(n)). X(1) has information that Y(0) does not, and utilizes this in a deception.
</li><li> <strong>Level 2</strong>: Y(2) knows that X(1) is playing a deception. Y(2) reacts accordingly.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Level 3</strong>: X(3) knows that Y(2) is well aware of the deception, and thus plans for the outcome of the first deception being revealed.
</li><li> <strong>Level 4</strong>: Y(4) is aware of the above play, and knows that the logical reaction to finding out the deception will play right into X(3)'s hands. Thus, Y(4) plays around X(3).
</li><li> <strong>Level 5</strong>: X(5)'s entire deception is a deception, maybe meant only to engage Y(4).
</li></ul><p>And so on, and so on.
</p><p>This chain can go on indefinitely. In the really hairy cases, one or more deceptions are being played parallel or maybe even in conjunction with one another, making the above-mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a>.
</p><p>From the second level on, the recipient of the deception (in this case Y) has two choices: either Y plays a counter-game so that the deception is revealed, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapIsTheOnlyOption">Y willingly plays the deception to X's logical conclusion</a>. The first option will reveal Y to be playing a higher level, but will foil X's deception. The second option will let X fulfill the deception, but will not reveal Y's level. Reaction from Y is crucial, as this separates Y from a player of equal level to X. If that was the case, Y would simply be aware of the deception but unable to act upon it. In reacting, Y steps it up a level.
</p><p>Of course, with each rise in level, the below levels become meaningless, so this gambit only works if X is not playing an even higher level, in which case Y would either be playing into X's hands or letting X win.
</p><p>X also runs the risk of misjudging Y's level. If Y is playing a higher level than anticipated, then the deception is, as mentioned above, meaningless. If Y is playing a lower level, then X will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> but never engaged on the higher levels, which may leave X <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">Kansas City Shuffle</a> occurs the mark (X) is at level 2 and thinks the con (Y) is at level 1, when actually the con is at level 3.

Frequently a consideration in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole">Feed the Mole</a>. In many an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">Absurdly High-Stakes Game</a> this will take the form a (often internal) monologue. Sometimes circumvented by making a completely random (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsOrTails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsOrTails">Heads or Tails?</a>), unrelated, or unexpected move, which is where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploy</a> might come in handy.
</p><p>Usually results in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Overly Long Gag</a>. Frequently ends with an "I <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">Didn't See That Coming</a>". May result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge">Archive Binge</a>-like behavior when plans are laid for both eventualities, and then for both of those eventualities, and then all four of those, and then all sixteen... This may develop into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> if it hasn't done so already.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is pretty much the name of the game from the time L shows up. So, all of it, really. It might as well be called I Know You Know I Know: The Manga Series. Especially when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> L and Light start working together to catch Kira, who is actually Light. L was always slightly better at the up close and personal mindgames, but Light fared better in the end</span>.
</li><li> Humorously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> somewhat early on, when L challenges Light to a friendly tennis match. The two of them both start long, intricate inner monologues about how they can psychoanalyze the other based on their behavior during the match, even when they know the other already knows they'll be doing this and will be acting accordingly... by the match's end, they both conclude that there's too much knowing going on that neither can conclude anything significant about the other based on the match.
</li><li> The series finale may be the largest example of this anywhere. Light and Near are somewhere around eight layers deep into this, both of them believing that they are one step ahead of the other. There's an entertaining panel in the manga where other characters witnessing a "conversation" between Light and Near begin to wonder why neither of them are <em>saying</em> anything.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> does something like this during the big game between Ojou and Deimon during the Fall Tournament, with a whole string of characters reacting with shock, then going "Is that what you expected me to say?" when a dramatic play seems to go one way, then the other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em>: Considering it's a series that's about people trying to kill each other to become God where each and every one of them can predict the future this happens often.
</li><li> In the "Little Army" prequel manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Miho knows that the StuG III her sister Maho is commanding in their practice battle against each other doesn't have a rotating turret, but she's aware that Maho knows she knows this. Maho then plans on setting an ambush, but Miho plans to ambush Maho first, which results in Maho taking the initiative and almost taking out Miho's tank. The battle ultimately concludes in a final exchange of shells, resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maho</span> just barely winning.
</li><li> Appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, strangely not as a part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>, but in a sniper duel. In fact, the whole episode revolves around knowing and predicting enemy tactics. The story is told by one character during a poker game to illustrate to the other players why he is so good at bluffing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Every</em> fight during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency</a></em> follows this pattern. Joseph attacks, the opponent declares they saw it coming and counters, Joseph explains he saw <em>that</em> coming and twists the attack as needed, and so on until one side or the other goes down.
</li><li> This carries over to later parts of the series. For example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, Jotaro "fakes" his genuine ability to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">move through stopped time</span> so that Dio would be caught off-guard after calling him on his apparent bluff.
</li></ul></li><li> This makes up about a third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em>, the other two-thirds being basic game theory and heroic determination. In particular, the defeat of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tonegawa</span> in the first season is based on Kaiji's realization of when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tonegawa</span> will <em>stop</em> knowing he knows. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tonegawa's observant enough to notice that two of Kaiji's cards are bloodstained on the back, and clever enough to realize that Kaiji has to know the cards are bloodstained. From there, Tonegawa assumes that Kaiji set a simple trap, bloodstaining cards other than the ones Tonegawa thought he had out, so as to trick him into playing the wrong card and losing. But because Tonegawa thinks he's better and smarter than lower-class gamblers like Kaiji, it doesn't occur to him that Kaiji would realize that Tonegawa would realize this, and that the cards are exactly the ones he initially thought they were.</span>
</li><li> Most of the point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> is like this, with Yang Wenli and Reinhard (and various other pairs) making plans, which may include knowing their opponent's plans (and sometimes involve a plan being an opponent seeing though the plan, with an extra layer of fake planning below it).
</li><li> The third round in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame">Liar Game</a></em> becomes this with Akiyama and Yokoya. The fourth round features it even more.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em>, there's a fair amount of this going on when the Eastal Alliance approaches the Round Table Conference for help against the goblin armies. Eastal desperately needs the Adventurers' superior military abilities, but they don't want to appear vulnerable, lest they make themselves out to be weak. The Round Table Conference, meanwhile, wants to help but don't want to make it seem like they are subservient or inferior to Eastal, lest the Eastal nobility think they can order the Adventurers around whenever they want. And of course, each side of the discussion is aware of the other side's agenda, and the fact that the other side knows their agenda. What follows is a complex and delicate battle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalJudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalJudo">Verbal Judo</a> between the two powers as they try to be allies while saving face.

She then points to some fruit growing in the trees, which the gang decided to take... causing them to fall right into a trap set by Team Rocket, who set up the basket knowing it would be ignored.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/RavagesOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/RavagesOfTime">Ravages of Time</a></em> runs on this trope.

Zhang Fei and Chen Gong were scheming against each other; the former was trying to lure Lu Bu to Xiapi to kill him while the latter wish to drive out Zhang Fei to take Xiapi. Both of them outlines their plans, and the narrative switch back and forth between them anticipating each other.
</li><li> According to Pang Tong, the ultimate strategy is to "Let your opponent know your next step. Even more brilliant is to let your opponent know your next <em>two</em> steps." (And then, the next <em>three</em>...)

He gives a long internal monologue about whether or not the card Yugi placed down was a trap card or if that was too obvious...
<ul><li> "Aw, forget it, I'm just gonna attack."
</li><li> This exact scenario, with whatever permutations, has gone on in in the mind of every person who has played the game in real life, at least once.
</li><li> In the duel between Yugi and Atem, both know the cards of their opponent and much of the match is spent guessing what the other likely played and how to counter it, and even tricking them into countering it for a better return.
</li><li> Any duel involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Crow</a> becomes this for his opponent, sometimes because he makes it a point to flaunt his foolproof strategy (which actually works) and sometimes because his opponents think too much.

<ul><li> Proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a> strategy, especially at higher levels, requires this kind of thinking and trying to stay one step ahead of your opponent(s). At its highest levels, the whole thing can get ridiculous, break down, and require game theory to come up with an ideal solution.
<ul><li> Notably, it's also important to be playing exactly one level higher than your opponent but no more. There's no point playing at level 2 (Trying to work out what cards your opponent has) if they are only playing at level 0 (i.e. without looking at their cards) and there's no point playing at level three (manipulating your table image to convince your opponent you have certain cards) if your opponent is playing at level 1 (only looking at their cards without trying to work out what you have).
</li></ul></li><li> Blackjack strategy (e.g., "counting cards") and trying not to let casinos notice you thinking too much is a meta-gambling example which can, at its extreme, surpass anything you've read in a spy novel.
</li><li> Trading card games can have a variety of rules, exceptions, and so on to keep things interesting, but <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is well-known for the numerous and sometimes surprising ways the action can be altered, and the official rules tell you to <em>expect</em> this by saying that if a card says something contrary to the rules, <strong>you follow the card</strong>. There are cards to alter almost any aspect of the game, from draw to battle to endgame, so <em>any</em> action you take can begin this kind of mindgame.
</li><li> Even very simple games like "Odds and Evens" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockPaperScissors">RockPaperScissors</a>" tends to make for use of this trope to absurd degrees, all in simply figuring out what out of two (former) or three (latter) moves your opponent will play.

If you want to pretend that you do (or don't) know something, then instead of acting the way that you would if you <em>really</em> knew, you have to act the way that you think <em>they</em> think you would act if you really did (or didn't) know. You can fool a simple person by pretending you know everything and then subtly fishing for clues. And you can make them think you <em>don't</em> know anything, by making an obvious <em>show</em> of fishing for clues. But you have to anticipate that a higher level player could realise that you're only <em>pretending</em> to bluff, when in fact you really did know all along.
<ul><li> Harry successfully pulls this off in his first interaction with Lucius Malfoy, quite possibly by accident. When Lucius makes veiled references, Harry responds by playing along... badly. His deception is so obvious that Lucius sees through it almost immediately. Then Lucius starts to think it was <em>too</em> easy - Harry must have been only pretending to be a fool that pretended to understand. He says as much, and walks away, apparently confident that his original message was conveyed. Meanwhile, Harry doesn't have the faintest clue what's going on.

The Baron Harkonnen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discusses</a> this trope with his nephew in his introductory chapter, calling it "plans within plans within plans."

Leto is captured by people whom he believes to be working for the Bene Gesserit, only to have it turn out that Alia is secretly calling the shots. He himself, however has a deeper plan that eventually trumps all of theirs and renders them moot.

You can almost see it coming when it is occurring at an earlier point in the novel (some hints are dropped that <em>something</em> is going on at either rate), but when you learn precisely what took place in one character's mind as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">seemingly-irrelevant events</a>, it forces you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">re-evaluate everything else that has happened.</a>

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> plays this one straight in one of his mystery stories, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePurloinedLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePurloinedLetter">The Purloined Letter</a>". Private eye <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CAugusteDupin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CAugusteDupin">C.

</li><li> Vetinari plays a subtle form of this game off-screen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>. His mail packets to and from Uberwald are always clearly tampered with, and his semaphore transmissions are always intercepted. This is all as expected, and he encrypts his communiques with codes that are <em>almost but not quite</em> unbreakable. He <em>could</em> come up with a cypher no one else on the Disc could break, but that would be far less useful. <em>This</em> way, only his most resourceful rivals (specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">Lady Margolotta</a>) can read his messages, and then he knows <em>exactly</em> what they think he knows.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HammerOfTheWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HammerOfTheWitches">Hammer Of The Witches</a></em>, leading up to the climactic confrontation with the traitor, both sides know the other is aware of the true nature of the situation, but both keep up the front of naivete.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> books), part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Thrawn's effectiveness in battle is based on his reputation: his enemies know fully well he's a nigh-unparalleled master strategist and tactician, so from their perspective each and every move he makes is like Schrodinger's Gambit, existing in a state of It's A Trap and It's Not A Trap until they open the box and the waveform collapses.
<ul><li> The climax of the third book brings this to an epic level. Thrawn knows that the New Republic wants to capture an important bit of technology, of which only three are known to exist, all on Imperial worlds. The New Republic knows that Thrawn knows this. They also know that one system is heavily protected while another is only lightly defended. Thrawn knows that they know this. The New Republic knows that Imperial Intelligence is very good and will pick up disinformation that shows an attack on the lightly protected system is in the works. Meanwhile they actually plan to attack the heavily-fortified one. (Because both sides know that the New Republic stands a better chance of victory in either case so long as Thrawn himself and his fleet aren't there.) Thrawn knows that the New Republic knows that his intelligence is that good, and that the "secret plans" are a deception, so he disregards those attack plans and prepares for the <em>real</em> attack. The one thing <em>neither side</em> knew was that the Smuggler companies had all agreed among themselves to back the Republic by hitting whichever target they didn't on the assumption that Thrawn would be at the real target and they would be well paid for succeeding where the military failed. The rebels thought they were on the other side and handed them the false lead, which they thought was a real tip, and so they showed up as unanticipated Rebel reinforcements completely by accident.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a></em> Duology, set a decade later, a trio of Imperials conspire very successfully to make it look like Thrawn is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. When Han Solo finally sees the (fake) Grand Admiral and has his suspicions deftly countered, it's a shock. Thrawn was, after all, alarmingly good at anticipating what people would do.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Han:</strong> From now on, we can't trust anything we see. Anything we see, anything we hear, anything we think we ought to do. Not with Thrawn back on the scene. <br/><strong>Lando:</strong> Thrawn or no Thrawn, the Empire <em>is</em> still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">down to eight sectors</a>.

<ul><li> Zhuge Liang is the <strong>master</strong> of this trope. Various plans include:
<ul><li> Empty City: Zhuge Liang sits alone in an empty city playing his harp while a rival army comes up. They know that Zhuge is a genius and is obviously up to something. Knowing they would know this, the city <em>really is empty</em>, and the whole thing was a stall tactic. That worked.
</li><li> Two Roads: Cao Cao is leading his army through a mountain pass when he comes to a fork in the road, one direction he can see a lot of smoke as you would expect from army camp fires; down the other he sees <em>very</em> little smoke. Obviously, the big smoke path is a ruse and the little smoke path is an ambush. Actually? I Know You Know I Know, the big path is the real army.

The police reason that since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu">Fu Manchu</a> is such a wily mastermind, and the first place "anyone" would look for him is Chinatown, that is really the LAST place he will hide. Only Fu Manchu expects them to reason like that, and moves into Chinatown. Only Nayland Smith figures that is exactly what he will think.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>. Edward and Alice Cullen play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">chess</a> game by using their abilities to figure out what move the other is going to make next... and countering... and being countered... and countering again... and so on.... The game is finished in their minds before two pieces are physically moved.
</li><li> A children's book titled <em>Finding Buck McHenry</em>, about a man who may or may not be a retired pro baseball player, has the young narrator going, "I knew. And he knew that I knew. And I knew that he knew that I knew. Stop. You're making yourself dizzy." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The story Mack Henry eventually tells is half true; he did play baseball as a young man, but he wasn't the same man the kids are confusing him with.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Mistress of Dragons</em>, Draconis knew that Edward knew that Draconis knew that Edward didn't trust him. I had to spend 5 minutes interpreting that.
</li><li> In "Riding the Bullet", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>, the main character is on the verge of freaking out when he dizzies his own mind with how he can't let the dead guy next to him know that he knows that he knows that he's dead (or something, I'm quoting from memory).
</li><li> Sometimes both parties can "win" at this (or at least, two out of three can). In one short story in <em>Future on Ice</em> (edited by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a>), an immortal being finds two soldiers who're lost and starving to death, and it gives them each two boxes. It's observed them and claims it knows how they think, and if it predicted of one of them that he'd only open one box, it gave him food in one box, and in another box a device that will allow the user to become immortal if he so chooses. If it predicted one would open both boxes, one box will have food and the other will be empty. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">The Philosopher</a> points out that no matter what the immortal thought, they lose nothing now from opening both boxes. The immortal predicted that he'd do this, but not that his comrade would listen to him, so said comrade is the only one to get an immortality device. The thing is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">The Philosopher</a> didn't <em>want</em> immortality, and he later figures out that the device in question actually disintegrates the user and creates an immortal copy.</span>

It stands to reason that if the Axis finds out, they'll switch to a new cipher, so being able to act on the information they got without revealing they have this information becomes very important. Partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; Detachment 2702 is fictitious, but using the information gained from broken codes without revealing that the codes were broken was a major concern for Allied Intelligence.

She stabs one of her swords into the floor and proposes that Kyousuke uses it, since it is the only means he has of putting up a fight against her. He refuses, suspecting it's a trap. But then the Queen reveals that stabbing the sword into the floor caused a chain reaction that destroyed the reactor keeping the people alive. She made the offer knowing full well that Kyousuke would reject it, so that he'd break under the realisation that his own decision condemned the people he'd been trying to save. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Except Kyousuke then reveals he expected this</a>, as he knew the Queen would never give him any way out.

Then he returns to Rashnikov so the Russians know that the British know that they know that the British know. How long did this continue?

<ul><li> The general concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">second intention fencing</a> takes this to ridiculous levels, until someone decides to interrupt all of the feints and counterattacks with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">a simple straight lunge</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">baseball</a>:
<ul><li> When one team manages to figure out the second team's signals they'll usually try to only act on that knowledge at a critical point in the game. The second manager might intentionally allow them to try and steal the signal so at the critical point they think they know what's being planned. Which could cause paranoia in the first manager if the signal seemed too easy to steal, leading to suspicion of a setup. Which the second manager would know, so...
</li><li> In another baseball example, catcher Carlton Fisk once managed to confuse a batter by talking about how he knew the batter knew the pitcher was ignoring Fisk and only throwing fastballs down the middle, and the pitcher knew Fisk knew the batter knew but wouldn't listen to when Fisk said he was signalling for curveballs (he was actually signalling for fastballs...down the middle). After an epic performance which included Fisk screaming at the pitcher to throw the curveball and going out to the mound, yelling and waving his arms around, the batter was so screwed up trying to figure out who knew what was supposed to happen he could only watch a third strike fastball go right down middle.
<ul><li> To avoid this kind of insanity, some coaches start with bullshit signals, then a sign (often very subtle) meaning "okay, here's the <em>real</em> signal" and anything after that is real. Of course, this can be figured out as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The extensive, ever-evolving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">metagame</a> between a pitcher and a hitter can get a little ridiculous, resulting in both trying to goad the other into a mistake, but all a non-savvy audience sees is two men staring at each other, fidgeting, and adjusting their jock straps for minutes on end.
</li><li> There's also the game of chicken played between baserunners, the pitcher, and the catcher. The defense knows that the offense will try to steal bases, and will maintain utmost vigilance to prevent such. The offense knows the defense knows, and will try to bluff the defense, or sacrifice one of the base runners so that the other can advance. The defense knows the offense knows the defense knows...
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American football</a> it's not uncommon, in a short-yardage situation on fourth down in field goal range, for the offense to line up and try to draw the defense offside. If it works, they get the first down and continue the drive, and if it doesn't they can call a time out (or take the five yard penalty for delay of game if they're close enough) and try for the field goal. Since this is so obvious, the defense typically knows they're trying this. However, on some occasions the offense does run a play, catching the defense off-guard because they know the defense knows they're trying to get an offside and not run a play. However, the defense knows that the offense knows that the defense knows what they're trying, so they're on the lookout for an actual play. However the offense knows that...

Keyword effects (basically, status ailments that fell under a specific subgrouping) were often pretty nasty, so people would pick up keyword defenses (things that nullify or grant immunity to effects with a given keyword for a time) so as to not get hit with those, or just find ways to not get hit in the first place. Since people would just pick up these defenses, people often wouldn't bother trying to use keyword effect charms because they'd just be canceled, and in some cases the defense was actually cheaper to use than the thing it canceled (and many defenses lasted a while once up). Some people figured they could save on EXP by not picking up these keyword defenses because if people assumed any keyword effect they used would just get canceled then they wouldn't bother using keyword effects, and that in the few cases where they were used, simply not being hit in the first place would suffice as a way to avoid it. Works fine as an I Know You Know I Know cycle in most cases; gets a bit tricky when the supposedly weaker splats start throwing out even nastier keyword effects that aren't reliant on hitting someone directly. The fact that Dragon-Blooded add another level to the deception has been a rude awakening for more than one player.

</li><li> Jonathan Larson's semi-autobiographical musical, <em>tick, tick... BOOM</em>, contains a song called "Therapy". Essentially, the song is a dialogue between two characters detailing how, if they'd known that the other knew what they knew... things would be different. It's really quite brilliant. What makes it even better is that, in the end, the other character is proven right. To make this clearer, "I feel bad that you feel bad about me feeling bad about you feeling bad about what I said about what you said about me not being able to share a feeling." Whatever it was that she said about him not being able to share a feeling was probably accurate; he apparently isn't good at it.

To further increase the confusion, Techies can also place a minefield warning sign. Is the sign honestly warning you, or is it a trick to make you take the other path and get blown up there? These dilemmas can both be solved by putting down a Sentry Ward or buying a Gem of Truesight, which reveals the invisible mines so you can destroy them. But if the Techies buy Aghanim's Scepter, the minefield gains an additional ability: mines placed withing a small radius of it can not be revealed at all, even with truesight. Are you still willing to take that chance and walk through what may be a minefield? Or will you take the detour?

Pelinal was aware that Akatosh knew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">just how insane he was</a> and could always feel Akatosh's burning gaze upon him.

During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">creation of Mundus</a>, the mortal plane, Lorkhan convinced/tricked (depending on the storyteller) the et'Ada ("original spirits") who would become the Aedra (including Akatosh) into sacrificing large portions of their divine power to create Mundus. In revenge for this perceived treachery, the Aedra killed Lorkhan, tore out his "divine center" (heart), and cast it down into the world he created where his spirit would be forced to wander. Akatosh considered it a "moment of weakness" when he went with Lorkhan's plan to create Mundus and likely still harbors a grudge. When Pelinal went too far in one of his berserker fits of rage and damaged the lands themselves, Akatosh and the other divines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">nearly left Mundus in disgust</a> until they were placated by Alessia.

He only pretended to be deceived in order to find out what Eggman was up to. Charmy and Espio are shocked once again, this time by the realization that Vector is a halfway competent detective.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting games</a> live and breathe this trope in player vs player matches, especially at a high level. There are no moves or techniques in a fighting game that are outright more powerful than all others; each move has its time and place, and importantly, each move counters some options and is countered by some other options. So in order for a player to defend successfully, they have to guess what move the attacker will use, and respond with a defensive option that beats that attack. But the attacker knows this, so they should try to guess what the defender is going to guess, and choose an option that beats that; but the defender knows this, so they should try to guess what the attacker is going to guess that they're going to guess, and defend appropriately. Repeat ad nauseum. The term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGame">yomi</a> is of relevance, describing the ability to read your opponent's mind.

<ul><li> A semi-real life example, meaning it's actually an urban myth, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s Coventry dilemma. Allegedly, Churchill had to allow the city of Coventry to be bombed, to prevent the Nazis from finding out about the British spies in Germany who knew about the bombing plan. In reality, the British tried to jam the Germans' <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Beams">radio guidance system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but had to take a guess at the frequency to use. They got it wrong.
</li><li> When Alexander Litvenenko died, some of the speculation on who killed him got to this level. Welcome to the Cold War.
<ul><li> CIA chief of counter-intelligence James Jesus Angleton spent the 60s and 70s turning the CIA upside down looking for a KGB mole. Some agents began to suspect that <em>Angelton</em> was a mole, on the grounds that starting a witch-hunt for a KGB mole is exactly the sort of thing a KGB mole would do.
<ul><li> In the fictionalized version in Martin Gross' "The Red President", the White House allows the Angleton figure ("John 'the Baptist' Davidson") to be framed and disgraced so the Soviets won't know that THEY know who the real mole is.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There is a formal system called modal logic that can be used to model what certain agents in a system know (including what they know/do not know about what the other agents know/do not know).
</li><li> There is an active research field known as adversarial reasoning: essentially, building models that allow you to predict the actions of an adversary. Once the adversary happens to get a hold of your model it becomes rather useless, as he can make sure he does something other than what is predicted. So you simply create a new model - one that <em>takes into account the fact that your adversary has the old model that he thinks tells him what you think he is going to do!</em> The eventual end state is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">left as an exercise for the reader.</a>
</li><li> One classic example from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>: an agent was sent to Great Britain by the Germans, who intended that the British intelligence service capture him and use him as a double agent, at which point he could tell the Germans how British counterintelligence functioned. He proceeded to explain this plan to the Brits, who then had him send back two different sets of reports to Germany. One contained what the Brits wanted the Germans to know; the other contained what the Brits wanted the Germans to think the Brits wanted them to know.
<ul><li> Another WW2 example, Operation Bertram. In the desert campaign, the British wanted to launch an attack against the Germans in the North while convincing the Germans they were actually attacking from the South. To this end, the British built a large number of fake tanks (disguising tanks as supply vehicles) while also disguising a lot of supply vehicles as tanks. However, the British knew to make the Germans really believe the British's fake attack from the South was, the British had to be caught making a deception plan that was attempting to hide the real attack that was coming from the South. To this end, the British set up a bunch of fake artillery pieces in the South made sure the fake artillery pieces were fake enough to be noticed as fake by the Germans but not so fake that they were obvious. Before the expected German attack on the fake artillery, the British swapped out the fake artillery pieces with real artillery pieces to drive back the attack. As expected, the Germans attacked the seemingly undefended position, were repulsed by artillery, and thought that the fake artillery pieces were really a cover for the real attack coming from the South, and prepared for a Southern attack. However, the British attacked from the North, which the Germans were unprepared for, winning the following battle as the Germans fell for the British double bluff.
</li></ul></li><li> Very common in counter-espionage, classic example is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funkspiel">Radio Game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Allies sent a spy, Germans knew that he was a spy and turned him, Allies knew that the Germans knew, Germans knew that the Allies knew that they knew and finally ended the charade.
</li><li> During World War II, the Allies realized that one could confuse enemy radar by dropping small pieces of aluminum, i.e., chaff, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaff_%28countermeasure%29">but didn't do this because they were concerned that if they did, the Germans would figure this out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. As it turned out, the Germans had also discovered this but weren't doing it because of the same logic.
</li><li> Studies of animal intelligence sometimes use this trope as an analogy to model a species' cleverness in social interaction. Humans are the only species known to be able to do five levels of I/you know/think, while other great apes seem able to manage four (e.g. they can bluff and <em>be subtle about it</em> so the other ape won't catch wise). Or maybe the apes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">far better at it</a> than humans.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/">Blue-Eyed Islanders puzzle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> relies on this to an insane level, in that it ultimately depends on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a 100-story tall tower of hypotheticals. Let's say that K(0) is the knowledge that there exists someone on the island with blue eyes; and K(N+1) is the knowledge that everyone knows that K(N). So if I know K(1) it means I know everyone knows there's someone with blue eyes on the island; if I know K(2) it means I know everyone knows everyone knows there's someone with blue eyes on the island; and so on. The crux of the riddle rests on how, from being given <em>K(100)</em>, everyone on the island deduces they have blue eyes by a mind-numbing 100-day process of collapsing hypotheticals</span>. The crux of the whole thing is "common knowledge", defined as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">I Know You Know I Know</a> <em>to infinity</em>. Prior to the outsider's statement, the islanders all knew at least one of them was blue-eyed, and that all the other islanders knew that, but only up to N, not infinity. Once the fact becomes common knowledge, the hypotheticals can begin collapsing, but not before.
<ul><li> Professor Ian Stewart in <em>Math Hysteria</em> calls these Common Knowledge puzzles (his own version is about an order of logical monks who would be embarrassed if they realised they had a blue blob on their forehead, and are too polite to point out that another monk does). He cites an article by David Gale in the <em>Mathematical Intelligencer</em> as providing an overview of the puzzles, including the ultimate version: a <a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xnViTAYeblkC&amp;pg=PT13&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=%22mad+mathematicians+tea+party%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQuPkfEFPq&amp;sig=irZoA42NbqUffxjJXbP01SybROg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7RYiU9zINOiy0QWWnoC4Bw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mad%20mathematicians%20tea%20party%22&amp;f=false">Mad Mathematicians' tea party<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which it is used to deduce what <em>random numbers</em> the mathematicians have on their hats.
</li></ul></li><li> In Game Theory, the concept of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_Equilibrium">Nash Equilibrium<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a means to overcome this kind of stalemate.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem">Two Generals' Problem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> plays with this. Two generals have their armies surrounding a target. Each can send a message to the other saying they're ready to attack, but the other might not get it. They can't just send a message and go, because the other general might not get it and won't know. They can't just wait for the other to respond, because then the second message could be lost, and they won't know the other knows. The end result is that, no matter how many messages are sent, they won't be any more sure than if they just sent one message and hoped it arrive. While this situation is impossible to solve in theory, there's a lot of ground gained there by taking the engineering approach and looking for a solution that will work well in practice.
<ul><li> The problem is enhanced by the possibility that the defenders may be intercepting and corrupting messages. If it's merely a question of messages getting through, sensible organisation should only require a couple of confirmations before further messages become irrelevant.
</li><li> More specifically, the practical solution is to evaluate the probability of success of a single message transmission, and to then repeat the transmission until the probability of failure has been reduced to a calibrated trivial percentage (say the message has a 1/10 chance of failing, then after sending it once you can be 90% sure that both generals have heard the message, after the first response it's up to 99%, then you might want to send a third one to bring it up to 99.9%, then stop if you can live with a one in a thousand chance of failure, or keep going if you can't).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">The best solution is for the second general to fire a flare above the city to signify having received the first message.</a>
</li><li> How about agreeing on a series of colored flares: the first general sends up a flare (say, red) meaning that he's ready to attack, and the second responds with the same color to indicate that he will attack as well. Stealth is an issue, but...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Or just attack in such a blatant and obvious way that the other general will notice.</a>

<div class="indent"><a class="urllink" href="http://twitter.com/#!/Thunt_Goblins/status/75270899426803712">THunt_Goblins<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: I say stuff to Danielle, then I tweet what I said, then I tell her that I tweeted it and now I'm tweeting that I said I tweeted what I said. <br/><a class="urllink" href="http://twitter.com/#!/Thunt_Goblins/status/75270974395785217">THunt_Goblins<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: And I just told Danielle that I tweeted THAT.
</div></li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gold">Operation Gold,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the CIA and SIS tapped the telephone cable leading to the Soviet embassy in Berlin. The KGB was informed of this from the moment it began by a mole in the SIS, George Blake. The KGB, however, could not reveal that it knew, lest it expose Blake's existence. As a result, the tap was a successful source of accurate and actionable intelligence for eleven months. Eventually, Blake received a transfer and the Soviets "discovered" the tap. Then Blake got caught anyway a few years later and the CIA and the SIS realized that the KGB had known all along, and had to go through all the intelligence that they had garnered from the tap to try to figure out what was real and what the KGB had planted. Of course, once Blake was arrested, the KGB would have known that the CIA and SIS would be doing that, and so had to go through all the intelligence that they knew the CIA and SIS had gained and try to figure out what the CIA and SIS would conclude was real and what they would conclude was planted.
</li><li> Israel's nuclear strategy has relied on this: even though they've never officially admitted to having nuclear weapons or that Israel would use them if the existence of the nation was threatened, other countries know Israel has them and in what event they would use them. Israel knows they know about Israeli nuclear strategy, and they know Israel knows they know. The end effect is that all involved can conduct diplomacy and military strategy on the basis of everyone knowing about the nuclear weapons without anyone admitting they are there.
</li><li> Over at <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com">Not Always Right<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> there are many examples of people operating at level -1. The general scheme is that the narrator is being completely honest, but the idiot (usually a customer) thinking the narrator is trying to fool them in some way, ignores or deliberately goes against advice, and in doing so harms themself. E.g.
<ul><li> Being told not to buy a scanner when you don't own a computer <a class="urllink" href="https://notalwaysright.com/scanning-ahead/77084/">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Arguing the cashier into charging you more <a class="urllink" href="https://notalwaysright.com/math-is-your-friend/67772/">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> An FBI agent discussing a meeting he had with a Mafia boss described the situation: he met the boss at his business and congratulated him on going straight and staying away from the mob after an earlier prison sentence. The agent, of course, knew he was the family's boss. The boss knew the agent knew he was the family boss, and the agent knew the boss knew the agent knew. Thus they carried out a conversation where both were fully aware that while they were apparently talking about the legitimate business, both knew that wasn't what they were really talking about.
