</div></div><p>A story where (usually) a man falls in love with a woman, having raised her from childhood. She looked up to the man, thought of him as a father figure or beloved uncle, a guardian, counted on him to be there when she needed him, etc. In the more extreme cases, she might have even vowed to marry him when she came of age.

</p><p>Nothing is ever said about how inappropriate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">and even creepy</a>, this is in current society. If the man was a real parent, this would count as incest, but of course they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Relatives</a>. Often, the story tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">excuse</a> the man's behavior by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">claiming</a> that he resisted the idea of a relationship, but the girl convinced him. Advanced cases can have him trying to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMatchmaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMatchmaker">The Matchmaker</a> with her and men her own age despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush">Matchmaker Crush</a>; he may even be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a> because of it. This makes it <em>less</em> creepy, in that he didn't plan it in advance, and it is what she wants as well.
</p><p>A source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in older works, because it used to be common practice for noblemen to marry younger daughters of friends and acquaintances, so this trope would have occurred a lot both in fiction and real life. It was quite proper for a man to fall in love with his ward and for them to marry if she felt the same. Even in modern times, some people argue that this is not a problem so long as the former child is now an adult and able to properly consent.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>: Happens in the second season, considering Alois' whole life is a bit of Fridge Horror. After his little brother and entire village are killed, this already slightly off boy (who laughed cheerfully as he robbed the dead) begins living as a true city street rat. Knowing how things like that work out, and especially after seeing his reactions to things later on, it's quite obvious that this young boy solicited himself for food or shelter before he even hit a double digit age. Think about this: Jim is only around 11 when he goes to Earl Trancy's manor. There, he living with a bunch of boys in the same condition, being bathed and treated like cattle, all while being a sex slave to an old man. At the age of 11. It's quite obvious even then he is not a virgin, as he dolls up and puts on a beautiful red robe, seducing the old man expertly until the guy's kissing his feet. He even becomes the favorite boy, taking place for the man's son who vanished as a baby - the real Alois Trancy which allows him to take the name Alois after Claude kills the Earl. Episode 8 shows that Alois was raped by the former Lord Trancy. It's implied that this helped make him so Ax-Crazy  he's shown to have been a little off-kilter even before the event, having joked about his entire village dying and happily looted their corpses when they did, his violent tendencies seem to date from it, not to mention his compulsive promiscuity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OtakuNoMusumesan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OtakuNoMusumesan">Otaku No Musumesan</a></em> has a very literal instance in which the landlady, Taeko, was raised since elementary school by Sousuke, an aspiring manga artist, after her grandfather, her previous guardian, died. To solve an inheritance dispute when Taeko turned 16, the two get married, but the story makes it clear that love for each other strongly influenced the decision.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm">Carnival Phantasm</a></em>, where Aoko tries to do this with Shiki.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em> it is initially averted between a then-teenage Electra and Nemo, when she decides to keep her feelings for him a secret after accidentally overhearing that he viewed her as a surrogate daughter to replace his own children who he believed had both been killed (ironically she was on her way to confess her love to him at that time). They later get together anyway: she finally manages to reveal her true feelings (and how!) after Nemo is reunited with his real daughter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nadia</span> years later.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?" Epilogue</a>, Marie and Samson have married. In the series leading up to this, Marie is a precocious pre-adolescent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagAlongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagAlongKid">Tag Along Kid</a>. Samson never shows strong feelings toward young Marie, except a generally-protective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a>. In this epilogue, years have passed, Marie is a young adult, some off-screen romance has happened, she has married the older man and is pregnant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">their first child</a>. Because this romance didn't start in childhood it's not so creepy, and in the context of the setting (early 20th-century Europe) it's not even unusual.
</li></ul></li><li> More directly from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a> II</em> episode 39-41, where Umibozu had taught the girl Miki to fight when she was a child, and protected her for a while. When she's grown up she appears, wanting to marry him. Umibozu doesn't, but they end up running a restaurant together; exactly <em>how</em> close they are stays vague in the anime, though in the manga they eventually marry. Ryo Saeba refers to this as the former trope namer for this trope, the Hikaru Genji Plan.
<ul><li> Later Umibozu convinces Ryo to take a job to bodyguard a little girl by claiming he could pull this and she's going to grow quite beautiful. It's not clear how serious Ryo was about this, but he completed the job even after declaring he wasn't patient enough to pull it off... But she's fallen for him anyway, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">she won't act on it knowing he's actually in love with Kaori</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DesertPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DesertPunk">Desert Punk</a></em>, the title character takes on little Kosuna as an apprentice for this very reason. It's notable that this was actually <em>her</em> suggestion, which she supported by providing a picture of what she (falsely) claims is her mom.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kurenai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kurenai">Kure-nai</a></em>: while Shinkurou is very protective of the little girl he's caring for, any romantic affection seems to occur solely on Murasaki's side (notice her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then again, considering Murasaki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a>, this can be seen as played straight from <em>their</em> part.</span>
</li><li> Amaterasu and Lachesis' relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories">The Five Star Stories</a></em> is like this, but since they're more or less the only two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> in their universe it's excusable. Who else are they gonna be with?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted">Gender Inverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ShakuganNoShana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ShakuganNoShana">Shakugan no Shana</a></em>, where a female Crimson Lord by the name of Pheles raises a boy named Johan and the two later fall in love after Johan was grown up.
</li><li> A rather horrific, twisted version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta">Kaze to Ki no Uta</a></em>, wherein Auguste manipulates and abuses his young nephew/foster son/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actual son</span>, Gilbert, having the young man love him unconditionally while having complete control over him. He eventually engages Gilbert in a sexual relationship (when Gilbert is nine) so as to keep him just as obedient forever. This is just the beginning of the crap that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Gilbert</a> has to go through because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse">curse</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bastard">Bastard!!</a></em> manga, Dark Schneider rescues a dark elf girl named Arshes Nei and then pursues a sexual relationship with her once she comes of age. (Of course, Dark Schneider isn't exactly meant to be a paragon of moral behavior...) Comes off as far-less squick since, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy">Dark Fantasy</a> setting, they're both pretty much immortal by definition (one being a demi-deific sorcerer, the other being a Drow) - at the very least, they each have potential lifespans that reach well into multiple millennia, so the years matter less.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Everything short of explicitly stated to have been successfully executed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gauron</span> with the twins Yu Fang and Yu Lan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The twins are so completely heartbroken by the fact that he's on the verge of death that they willingly undertake a suicide mission at Gauron's behest, rather than outlive him,</span> and Melissa Mao at one point notes that they seem to be devoid of any emotion other than total despair. Being able to see him again is the only thing that brings them a shred of happiness. In fact, their grief over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gauron's impending death</span> is used as a narrative counterpoint and equivalent of Sousuke's sadness at being separated from Kaname (as Mao notices that Sousuke's eyes and expression are exactly the same as Yu Lan's).
</li><li> Apparently, as clarified further in the novels, he tried to execute a Hikaru Genji Plan with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">the young Sousuke</a>, but failed completely. He pretty much told 12-year-old Sousuke, "Why don't you come to my camp? There's food, ammunition, and AS parts there." (Which sounds suspiciously like a "There's candy over in my van, little boy" scenario.) Knowing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gauron</span>, it's highly doubtful that his plans were anything pure and kindhearted. Of course, Sousuke refuses, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gauron</span> spends the next five years unable to forget "beautiful" Sousuke.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfPrince">½ Prince</a></em> character Zhuo Lin Bin, aka Wicked, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>, eventually raises Lan's daughter and is tricked into agreeing to marry her.

He is also concerned about the age difference, but since humans can live over 200 years in that time, it's not a major issue.

The training was sufficient that Naomi found it difficult to outright say she hated it, but an encounter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Kaoru</a> awoke her resistance and she began making him pay. She also soon after changed her codename from "Kittycat" to "Wildcat."

Yes, all three of them. Weirdly enough, Minamoto's <em>mother</em> also wants this as well, as do The Children. Minamoto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">does not</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Glimpses of the future show that this <em>will</em> eventually happen with all the girls, starting with Kaoru.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em>, Fran is asked by a patient to impregnate her with the DNA of her dead best friend and love interest after it's revealed her friend sabotaged her marriage because she wanted her for herself. The patient specifically requests that the resulting baby be male, since, as Fran puts it, the patient "finds men easier to love". This isn't even the most disturbing story from that manga.
</li><li> Part of the plot of the 2009 anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTaleOfGenji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTaleOfGenji">The Tale of Genji</a></em> (see Literature example below), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenjiMonogatariSennenki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenjiMonogatariSennenki">Genji Monogatari Sennenki</a></em>.

This ultimately leads to his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, as he feels he has nothing left to live for</span>.
</li><li> This is pretty much the relationship between Moeko and Mariya in the shoujo manga series <em>Kindan</em> (by Osakabe Mashin). Not that Mariya even really <em>bothered</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait">waiting until Moeko grew up</a>.
</li><li> Inverted in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UntilDeathDoUsPart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UntilDeathDoUsPart">Until Death Do Us Part</a></em>, where the heroine who ran up to the protagonist for rescue and help early on later revealed that she's staying with him not only to be rescued, but also because he's her future husband. The two she told this to were shocked on finding out and told her not to tell the protagonist about it, though she seems set on making said prediction come true. The heroine is twelve and the protagonist is in his mid-to-late twenties, which would make this a lot more squicky if not for the fact that there is no romance to speak of at this point and she is a powerful precognitive, so the foretold marriage could be decades off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheBrideOfAdarshan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheBrideOfAdarshan">The Bride of Adarshan</a></em>, the main character, Prince Alexid is forced into a political marriage with the youngest princess of a conquered nation (a nation Alexid was largely in charge of conquering). How young? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Ten.</a> To the story's credit, this is treated as pure politics, even as Alexid and Justinia do grow closer to each other, with Alexid taking on a Guardian/Big Brother role towards her. And the story clearly implies that that will mature into something real by the time Justinia comes of age, assuming they survive the political shenanigans around them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane">Peacemaker Kurogane</a></em> manga, this was what the old merchant Yamatoya does with Suzu after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Suzu's master was killed and he was left all alone starving in the streets</span>. Although he's old enough to easily be his grandfather, he apparently picked up Suzu entirely for the purpose of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raping him and making him his "pet"</span>. Suzu wasn't the only one, however — two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">twin</a> kitty boys were also picked up by him for this purpose. Suzu <em>does</em> end up getting revenge on him, however. To put it in Suzu's words:

Not to mention that it's pretty much stated outright that the only reason why he got married was just so he could get Road as his daughter. Hum.

</li><li> Griffith's relationship with Casca has shades of this, as he met and rescued her when she was quite young, trained her as a warrior in his army, but also viewed her as a "back-up" in case things did not go according to plan with Princess Charlotte. When Griffith, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guts left the Hawks and defeated him</span>, had his tryst with Charlotte and got put to the torture for a year because of it, the discovery that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Casca had fallen in love with Guts and the two were in a relationship together</span> blew this little plan out of the water and drove him over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>.

He made her wear the same clothes her mother wore, and... did stuff to her that a father shouldn't do to his daughter. Of course, this change seems to have been made to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">erase any doubt that Villefort is a depraved villain that deserves what's coming to him</a>.

Nina is desperate for the love of her adoptive father Sergay Wong who only thinks of her as his daughter. Her friend Arika also falls for him, and that's almost as awkward for Sergay since he suspects (correctly) that Arika is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the daughter of his former love, Lena Sayers</span>. It should also be pointed out that it was Nina who decided to play off this trope and wanted to become an Otome in order to be more like Lena who Sergay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">had a crush on as a boy</a>. Sergay doesn't find out Nina's feelings until late in the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he actually does get a chance to play this trope straight and yet he can't do it because he thinks of Nina as his own daughter.

At the very least, other magicians and magical beings believe him and constantly call Chise his bride/fiancee. According to Lindel, it's actually not uncommon for a magician master to marry his/her disciple.

<ul><li> One of the outright weirdest examples of this trope happened in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">Superman</a>'s Girl Friend Lois Lane</em>. You see, Superman is turned into a baby by some Red Kryptonite, and Lois tries to raise him so that when he reverts to his real age, he'll want to marry her — and so does Lana Lang. In the end, their plans work...but not as intended, since the Superman in question was from an alternate universe, and he ends up returning home and marrying his universe's Lois and Lana. Both women used <em>post-hypnotic suggestion</em> to influence baby Supes! <a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/06/16/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-lois-lane-hypnotized-a-baby-to-make-superman-marry-her/">Read excerpts here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jakehateseverything.com/2006_11_01_archive.html">and here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Two issues later, Lois Lane used a time machine to travel back to ancient Krypton to <a class="urllink" href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3125/265713-19245-120749-1-supermans-girl-frien.jpg">steal Kal-El's father for herself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> so SHE COULD BE HIS MOTHER. Wait don't shudder yet there's more: after she finally remembered that Krypton would explode someday, she decided to leave and restore the timeline to normal with her time pod...but not before stopping over at a baby Kal-El's house so she can open mouth kiss him. Repeatedly. Jor-El, rightly knowing a psychopath when he sees one, stuffed the loon in a Phantom Zone crystal and she ended up being saved by a future Superman on Earth, who in defiance of everything Back to the Future taught us remembered her. Because the Silver Age, that's why.

</li><li> Similarly, a certain segment of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em> fandom does the same for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a> versions of Sabretooth and Blink.
</li><li> Apparently there is a camp of fanfiction writers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> that use this angle on Archer and Rin.

Due to the fact that there is only a year difference between them, many fans actually make Hinata little in a lot of fanfiction and fanart, with Neji taking care of her, before the romance happens. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth">Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth</a></em> did not help stop this interpretation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> fics have several of these.
<ul><li> The Spain/Romano pairing. Romano used to be under Spain's care as a kid, with Spain doting on him and Romano getting jealous whenever Spain paid more attention to his brother than to him. In modern times, Spain's still very affectionate towards the grown-up Romano, and Romano still has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> streak. They're not quite an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext">subtext</a> is definitely there.
</li><li> The America/England pairing, actually called the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Reverse</a> Hikaru Genji Plan" in Japanese fandom, is a more complicated example: England and America used to be in a happy big brother-little brother relationship. Then America grew up, decided he didn't want that kind of relationship with England anymore, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">broke away from him</a>. It's implied that the two still care about each other after that event, but that the nature of their affections has changed, with England going from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> to blushing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> and America from adoring little brother to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">an equal who enjoys riling England up</a>. Not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> either, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext">subtext</a> is heavy.
</li><li> While they haven't had half the subtext these two other couple had (at least in the strips), a potential relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">France</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman">Seychelles</a> could certainly be seen as an example. The <em>Gakuen Hetalia</em> game (written by and illustrated by Himaruya himself) shows a younger France playing with a child Seychelles in a beach as he helps raise her and then bringing her to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU">High School A.U.</a> where the "story" sets in, and one of the game's endings has him hugging a blushing Seychelles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">being snarked at by her</a>.
<ul><li> Often in fanon, France is portrayed this way towards young Canada too.
</li></ul></li><li> J-fen seems to be fond of equaling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">the Japanese colonization of the Taiwanese islands</a> with Japan raising his younger sister Taiwan as a prospect wife.
<ul><li> There are several China/Japan works (mostly in the Japanese fandom) where Japan is the "wife" being husbanded. This is of course an extension of China being portrayed as the big brother who raised the other Asian countries. However, when China is shipped with other Asian nations, he is rarely shipped with them being portrayed as children. It looks like that's a special "privilege" reserved for Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> Any nation who was ever responsible for raising a nation in their childhood falls into this. Currently in fandom, England's the biggest bait for this. Having had the largest empire in history, and having the most ex-colonies appearing in the series, it's not that hard to put him in this position. Evidence: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations">The Commonwealth of Nations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. America/England was already explained in detail above. There are tags on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KinkMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KinkMeme">Kink Meme</a> (the section where they organize the fills) just for England and his Commonwealth. <a class="urllink" href="http://toxic-toothpaste.deviantart.com/art/HETALIA-CRACK-MEME-D-130789012">On dA, some memes include a "Draw England as a pimp with his colonies" section<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This is also the portrayal used by Turkey fans, in regards to the Turkey/Greece or Turkey/Hungary pairings.
<ul><li> And one or two Egypt/Greece fanworks, but not half as strongly.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Lenore and Ragamuffin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LenoreTheCuteLittleDeadGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LenoreTheCuteLittleDeadGirl">Lenore the Cute Little Dead Girl</a></em> are prone to this, mostly due to the fact that he takes care of her, being her guardian and friend at the same time. Even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay">she's often paired with him when she's a child</a>, because Lenore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild">can't practically grow up physically</a>. Still, there are instances when fans make Lenore older just to avoid any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: both the Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan/Anakin slash pairing. In fairness, the last two are described as "equals" and "closer than brothers, closer than lovers" in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> novelization but ... still. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ekxk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ekxk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ekxk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most likely the story is using the older interpretation of the phrase "blood is thicker than water".

</li><li> This is the plot of <em>The Bow</em> by Kim Ki-duk. The main character is an old man, who lives in seclusion on a boat with a 16-year-old girl, whom he found at an early age. It is agreed that they will marry when she turns 17. The girl trusts him absolutely, up to the point when she meets a young boy, who plans to take her away from the old man. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The old man eventually marries her, but after the ceremony he rides with her on another boat, then makes her go to sleep by playing a song and jumps into the water happily, drowning himself.

</li><li> Happens in the French movie <em>Le Bossu</em> (a.k.a. <em>On Guard</em>), with the girl having fallen in love with her guardian and him initially resisting. It still fails not to seem creepy, mostly because he became her unofficial adoptive father sometime when she was <em>one year old</em>, and she went with unnerving speed from regarding him as "Papa" to thinking of him as "husband on the hoof" once she learned he wasn't any blood relation.
<ul><li> In the latest adaptation (<em>Le Bossu</em> was originally a swashbuckling novel, as mentioned below), <em>Lagardère</em> (2003), he marries her widowed mother instead.

Floyd, who lives in a remote rural cabin, tries to set up traveling salesman Stephen with his innocent-but-willing eighteen-year-old daughter Dolores. Complicating this situation is that Floyd is a mood-swinging psychotic who himself has lustful feelings for Dolores. He has her do a strip-tease for Stephen, then nearly kills him for looking at her topless, then calmly praises her "perfect" breasts. It all goes downhill from there.

</li><li> The movie/play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigi">Gigi</a></em> is about an adolescent girl raised to be a wealthy man's ideal mistress (not wife, just mistress), but he ends up falling in love with her and marrying her.
</li><li> Inverted in the 2009 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Orphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Orphan">Orphan</a></em>- the titular character is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually a thirty-something year old adult who tries to come on to her legal guardians, and kills them when they refuse.</span>

</li><li> The film (and presumably the literature it's based on) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PortraitOfJennie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PortraitOfJennie">Portrait of Jennie</a></em> does an odd variation on this when an artist meets a mysterious, too-young girl. Jennie promises him that they are meant to be together and that she will grow up for him... and does. Very quickly. Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's already dead</span>. Despite this description, it's a beautiful film.
</li><li> In Hideo Gosha's <em>Kai</em> (桨), a man buys up the pre-teen daughter of a poor family and has her trained as a geisha. In the following years, she develops romantic feelings for him.
</li><li> Definitely invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GeorgyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GeorgyGirl">Georgy Girl</a></em>, where family friend banker Leamington has watched the spirited Georgy grow from child to woman, and makes her the outrageous (by today's standards) offer to be his mistress. By the time she's finally willing to give in it's to become his wife — in order to keep the baby's she's been tending. It's implied that by now their promise is in form only, neither looks satisfied after the ceremony.
</li><li> A slightly different version occurs in <em>Great Balls of Fire</em>, where it's suggested that Jerry Lee wanted to marry Myra <em>to</em> raise her (and train her in wifely obedience before she'd be old enough to "Get Ideas").

The protagonist Sang-hyeon becomes her lover, alleviating the misery of her loveless marriage and the slave-like relationship she has to both her husband and foster mother.

After Andrew the android helps to raise Amanda, she develops romantic feelings for him, but he's oblivious to her advances (not to mention that he doesn't even look human yet), so she marries someone else. Then he comes back after a century or so and falls in love with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">identical granddaughter</a> Portia.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Womb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Womb">Womb</a></em> a woman gives birth to the clone of her dead boyfriend, raises him like a son, and eventually has sex with him.
</li><li> In <em>Legacy: A Mormon Journey</em> Eliza tell the gentleman who's trying to court her that she's sworn to marry Jacob because he was like a father to her when she had no one. He's the kindest man she knows. The gentleman tells her that marriage is a great reward for kindness.
</li><li> In the horror film <em>Embryo</em>, Rock Hudson plays a scientist who experiments on a female fetus, accelerating its growth until it's a beautiful and accomplished young woman, at which point they have sex. The young woman then discovers that her body will soon disintegrate due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">Rapid Aging</a>, kicking off the "horror" part of the movie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The movie ends with the woman dying of old age while at the same time giving birth to the child she conceived with the scientist.</span>

The viewers can draw their own conclusion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLionInWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLionInWinter">The Lion in Winter</a></em> the marital rift / civil war between Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine exists partly because the aged Henry took Alais as his mistress. Alais is a Princess of France, whom Eleanor had taken into her household as a ward when the girl was 8, with the plan to marry her to one of her sons (the future Richard I) when she was old enough. Alais is a young woman by the point the movie takes place, and Henry probably wouldn't actually have been involved much in her raising, but still. Bonus points for the fact that Alais is actually Eleanor's ex-husband's daughter by his second wife, which causes political problems, because they can't just simply reneg on the original engagement promise and keep her around as Henry's mistress. (Eleanor's problem with it seems to be part jealousy - she and Henry had been a rare royal love match a few decades earlier, so she took the mistress thing harder than most queens would have - and part a sense of being betrayed by her foster daughter.)
</li><li> A gender inverted version is explored in a 1973 Turkish film called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264052/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_63">Sultan Gelin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Sultan's parents don't want to give up the money they received and her in-laws don't want to give up the brand new "helping hand" they essentially bought, so a brilliant solution is found in betrothing her to the late groom's 5-year-old brother. This also saves the in-laws from ever having to worry about looking after the child, apparently, as they happily dump all of his responsibility on Sultan's head, who becomes the child's full-time caretaker while fully expecting to marry him when he's older. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">What could possibly go wrong?</a>

Plagued by forbidden feelings for the Emperor's wife, Fujitsubo, (his step-mother), Hikaru Genji becomes obsessed with her ten-year-old niece, Murasaki, who is the spitting image of her. After encountering resistance from the girl's guardians, who feel she's currently too young to be courted, he kidnaps her. He once had a debate with a friend over the idea that the perfect wife is one a man has raised and moulded himself, so he sets out to do exactly that with Murasaki. Years later when Genji 'adopts' another girl, Tamakazura the daughter of his best friend, he tells Murasaki that it is perfectly harmless and platonic, he is being a father to the girl since hers can't be, etc. To which she replies dryly that as she recalls <em>their</em> relationship began in much the same way and has, if she is not mistaken, become <em>anything</em> but platonic and paternal!
</li><li> Jack Vance plays with this in <em>The Palace of Love</em>, with the villain cloning a girl who spurned his lechery years ago and arranging for the clones to receive various upbringings which (according to his thinking) should make at least one of them susceptible to him. Not played completely straight in that he doesn't do the raising himself, though he does direct the manner of it. It still proves his undoing, though, because the hero protagonist has learned of the plan and figures (correctly, as it turns out) that at least one of them has to know which of several potential suspects is the man she was raised to love.

It's strongly implied that they are romantically involved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then it's revealed that she was the one that brought him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">King Veha</a> when he was a baby, and as the King was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">very busy</a>, she apparently came back and raised the boy herself every now and then. One day, after he left Tarkan to rule the country <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">for a while</a>, King Veha returns and finds Tarkan and this woman doing something (presumably sexual, but it's not specified), and it's implied that they are now married.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulFeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulFeval">Paul Féval</a>'s swashbuckler novel <em>Le Bossu</em> ("The Hunchback"). Rather on the creepy side, since the knight of Lagardère also raised Aurore when she was a child. Surprisingly, it hardly raises an eyebrow from anyone (political intrigues excepted) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that they do love each other and get married in the end.</span> Well, this <em>is</em> one of those older works, written in 1858.
<ul><li> To be fair, he <em>did</em> miss a few crucial years of her development, having left her as a child in a convent while he was chasing the bad guys across half of Europe, only to find a beautiful young lady when he came back. A beautiful young lady who (as described in long, loving detail by her mother) happened to be a (slightly) more feminine version of her <em>father</em>, the infamously gorgeous Philippe de Nevers, of whom Lagardere had been very, <em>very</em> fond. And perhaps not entirely in a platonic way, either, since during their first visit to Philippe's grave Aurore muses about how deeply Lagardere loved this noble man she did not know - and how he will never love <em>her</em> quite as much. Granted, all this probably adds more to the creepy factor, rather than taking away from it, but, for what it's worth, the issue <em>is</em> sort of discussed... just not from a modern point of view.
<ul><li> And if you go by the book, rather than the movies (where he is played by much older actors), Lagardere is barely an adult himself, being around 18 years-old when he finds himself acting as a father figure, and he never purposefully raises Aurore with the intent of marrying her later on — on the contrary, he is constantly trying to keep his feelings in check and distance himself from Aurore <em>without</em> actually hurting her. All in all, he's doing some rather fancy footwork to ensure both her honor <em>and</em> her happiness are preserved, and also that no one manages to kill her in the meantime. Oh, and that <em>she</em> does not kill her own mother because of <em>him</em>. It actually takes some heavy duty convincing from Aurore to accept her as his fiancee.

She isn't into it, though, and ends up with a guy closer to her own age.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryJames">Henry James</a>'s first novel, <em>Watch and Ward</em> (1878), Roger Lawrence is 29, wealthy, and unsuccessful at love. He decides to adopt 12-year-old Nora Lambert after her father commits suicide as a result of Roger's refusing him $100. Roger plans to raise Nora to be the perfect wife. Years later, Nora has romantic entanglements with two other men and rejects Roger's proposal, feeling duped by the whole arrangement. Roger eventually rescues her from a bad situation, and a grateful Nora marries him.

Additionally Judy's about eighteen when the story starts, so it's more 'paying for her to go to college and embark upon a successful writing career' than raising her on his part. On the other hand, he <em>does</em> occasionally abuse his authority as her patron to interfere with her relationships with other young men, particularly her best friend Sallie's older brother, Jimmie McBride.

In the past, the Sorceress Gayelette in the North (implied to be someone other than the Good Witch of the North that Dorothy met, but the latter only gets a name in adaptations and second-party continuations) couldn't find a suitable husband, so she picked an attractive little boy and had him raised to be her ideal husband.

The one who marries her quickly dies, so the other becomes a sort of unofficial godfather to his best friend's daughter. He falls in love with her, but knows how inappropriate it is, so he tries fixing her up with his nephew. She'll have nothing of it, and marries him anyway.
<ul><li> Also appears in the titular short story from <em>The Doctor's Sweetheart and Other Stories</em>. Doctor John is thirty when he first meets the eight-year-old Marcella, and "[h]e had the most to do with bringing her up..." and "Marcella was one of those girls who develop early... at fifteen, she was a woman, loving, beautiful, and spirited." The Doctor realizes he loves her, but vows not to put himself forward as a suitor, given her age and inexperience; but it's too late and she already loves him, anyway, so: "...one day, just a month before her sixteenth birthday, the two came hand in hand to Miss Sara and me... and told us simply that they had plighted their troth to each other." Of course her legal guardian uncle interferes and takes her away; but she comes back to marry the doctor when she is twenty-one, as she had promised.

Raul's hired as Aenea's bodyguard when she's eleven and he's 27, and is with her as a guardian for the next five years, until she sends him out on a mission for her.

Especially awkward since the man in question is a Catholic priest. Father Ralph first meets Meggie Cleary when she's just nine years old, and is an integral part of her life for the next ten years. After she grows up and marries another man, they reunite and have a brief, torrid affair which results in the birth of a son, Dane. When confessing to his superior, Father Ralph even admits that if he had met Meggie as an adult, the affair would never have happened; it's specifically <em>because</em> he had known her from childhood onward that he developed feelings for her.

Unfortunately for him, his retainers subvert his brainwashing intentions ... Made somewhat more squicky by the fact that Jame's mother is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gerridon's sister, Jamethiel</span> and that Gerridon sent her there explicitly to ensure the birth of his future bride.

</li><li> The novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndHemlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndHemlock">Fire and Hemlock</a></em> has a variation: while Tom is not involved in raising Polly <em>per se</em>, he is her moral support when her parents aren't there for her. She befriends him at age eleven or so and when they discuss what she should call him, she suggests "Uncle Tom." It also stresses the angle that she is the insistent partner, writing what amounts to a self-insert romance novel about them as a tween, while he tries to distance himself by dating a woman his age.

When that plan fails, she does the same with Prince Ancar of Hardorn — becoming his lover in the process — and succeeds in having him usurp his father's throne.

She is very much the pursuer, and although Rao returns her feelings, he is entirely aware of how inappropriate they are, and goes to great lengths to try to dissuade her.

In such cases, the male werewolf becomes a sort of uncle/older brother figure, or even a father figure, to the child, and it's assumed that of <em>course</em> she'll want to marry him once she's of age. To quote the series, "why would she say no?" It's also discussed how sad it is that the relevant werewolf is going to have to <em>wait fourteen years to have sex with his adopted daughter</em>.
<div class="indent">"You never saw a real parent so jazzed to play whatever stupid kiddie sport their rugrat could think up. I'd seen Quil play peekaboo for an hour straight without getting bored.

The main character, Jane, had an imaginary friend named Michael when she was eight.

Though it's not explicitly stated, it's clearly understood that Nastassya was either coerced or manipulated into becoming his kept woman when she was 16, which situation went on for a few years until she couldn't take it anymore.

Yes, he's the only adult who understands Emily and she's the only person (other than her now-dead father) who was ever his real friend. But he's old enough to be her father, and at their first meeting he's saying things like "Your life belongs to me, now," and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait">I'll wait for you</a>," and "One day I'll teach you all about lovers' talk."

He starts saying this when she's <em>seven</em>, right after she's been encouraged to call him her Uncle Edward.

He even remarks to her that he has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> been in love with her ever since she was thirteen at least</span>. Not quite as overt as other examples, since there was no intent and both parties had no idea they were in love until Emma had a presumed suitor, but still mildly squicky to modern readers.
<ul><li> In the modern-era remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless">Clueless</a></em>, this character is replaced by Cher's "ex-stepbrother" (his mother was married, to then divorced from, her father), who is only two or three years older than Cher. This cuts down on the squick considerably.

Although Edmund is only seven years older than Fanny, he is her only true friend and plays a very great role in forming her mind and character.

When Elizabeth is 14, Denoriel (and his sister Aleneil) deal with Elizabeth's awakening sexuality by getting her into Denoriel's bed. To be fair, in that era a 14-year-old female was old enough to be a mother, and Denoriel was a "safer" lover than some of the humans who were sniffing around the third in line to the throne. But this doesn't stop Denoriel from being simultaneously aroused and squicked by the idea.
</li><li> Spider Robinson wrote a short story, "Soul Search"(featured in the anthology <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CallahansCrosstimeSaloon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CallahansCrosstimeSaloon">Time Travelers Strictly Cash</a></em>), which asked what happens when you have a universe with both reincarnation and cryogenics. At the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when one character dies, the man who loves her tracks down the baby she was reincarnated as and adopts her, intending to marry her in eighteen years.</span>
<ul><li> Her plan had been this as well, but a bit more sinister version: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cryogenics comes in because she was going to <em>kill</em> the three children she'd determined had the highest chance of being her late husband's new form, in hopes of the soul returning to the frozen, now-healed body. When her life is eventually threatened by a lab accident, the people working for her - the man mentioned above included - allow her to die. However, <em>he'd</em> determined that a soul grows in maturity with each life, so it's with the hope that she's better in her next life that he prepares to enact the Hikaru Genji plan.</span>

</li><li> Marius, the ancient Roman Vampire from Anne Rice's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles">Vampire Chronicles</a>, encounters a female vampire named Eudoxia who does this with a young mortal whom she eventually plans to turn into a vampire companion, and urges Marius to do the same. Once he finds Amadeo (later known as Armand), he does.
<ul><li> Don't forget about Claudia (though perhaps to a lesser extent) as it's implied that she and Louis (one of her 'vampire fathers') have romantic feelings for each other, which is a source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squick</a> when you remember that Claudia has the body of a six-year-old and Louis was in his twenties when he became a vampire.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>'s parents are a semi-example. His mother was the daughter of his father's best friend, and he adopted her after said friend died.
<ul><li> And in a strange variation of Wife-Husbandry in the same novel, Elizabeth was adopted by Victor's parents in the hopes that she'd marry Victor when they grew up. So this isn't so much adopting a child to marry her yourself, but adopting a child so she'll marry her brother.
</li></ul></li><li> In Maggie Furey's <em>Aurian</em> books, Aurian is raised by her deceased father's friend Forral, from the age of seven to around eleven, complete with Aurian claiming that "I'm not going to marry a prince, I'm going to marry you." When Forral leaves after injuring her during their sword training, Aurian goes on to study magic at the Mage's Academy and becomes the Archmage's protégé. When Forral later returns, they both find themselves attracted to each other, and eventually after much angsting they consummate their love. It helps (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayFlyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayFlyDecemberRomance">or just makes it worse</a>) that Aurian is a mage and thus immortal.
<ul><li> Far worse is the Archmage Miathan's perverse lust for Aurian once she "matures" upon the return of Forral into her life. While he's been raising her to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">loyal ally</a>, he gradually goes from benevolent father to attempted rapist.

The man she chose to marry at fourteen, Michael O'Toole, is not only fairly old (in his sixties if memory serves), but also her stepfather for all intents and purposes. He helped deliver Simone at birth, actively raised her and her siblings, and fathered Simone's half-brothers with Nicole. Granted, the Wakefield/O'Toole family were not exactly suffering an embarrassment of riches in the human gene pool, but still. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>.

Malcolm and his half-brother Christopher's mutual parent was their father Garland, whose second wife was Alicia, the daughter of one of his friends. Garland didn't raise Alicia, but he knew her from the time she was a little girl, helped to provide for her and her mother after her father's death, and married her once she was of legal age.

Draconians were created to be reliable soldiers for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the story.

They succeed, and find themselves in the position of raising twenty baby females to adulthood.

Few are conceived, fewer are born, so monogamy is not only impractical but totally unheard of.

</li><li> In "Skrut" ("Скрут") by Maryna and Serhiy Dyachenko (in Russian) this is the main villain's backstory. The horrible spider monster used to be a knight who saved a little girl on a battlefield, and decided to raise her to become his wife. When she grew up she rejected him as a husband because she only could see him as a father. Betrayed by his beloved, the knight turned into a monster.
</li><li> Henry does this unintentionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAmericanVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAmericanVampire">The Last American Vampire</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He raises the orphaned Virginia Dare after the slaughter of the Roanoke colony, which left Virginia the only living survivor and Henry a vampire. When she reaches maturity, he's more than a little disturbed to find himself attracted to her, until she climbs into his bed and makes it quite clear the interest is mutual. He marries her, then later turns her (at her request). This also has some major unintended results, that span most of the book.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErebusSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErebusSequence">Erebus Sequence</a></em>, it's downplayed and gender-swapped with Lucien (protagonist of the first book) and Rafaela (his eventual love interest). She's not <em>that</em> much older than him, and is more his nanny and maid than mother figure, but their relationship nevertheless started out as caregiver-and-kid.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyEverYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyEverYours">Only Ever Yours</a></em> by Louise O'Neill, women are no longer born naturally; they are artificially engineered in laboratories, and trained to be perfect wives and companions for men. The "Father", the ruler of the Euro-Zone, designates <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Isabel</span> as his future wife from the day of her design. He doesn't raise her himself (since all girls are brought up in the School), but does visit her to groom her for their future marriage, as well as instructing the chastities to shape her into the kind of woman he wants. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ultimately subverted as Isabel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> rather than face the prospect of living as his wife.</span>

</li><li> The story "'Sieur George" by George Washington Cable has the title character raise the daughter of the woman he (apparently) once loved; when she's sixteen, he points out that it would now be scandalous for them to be living together... unless, of course, they were married. She promptly leaves their small apartment and never speaks to him again.
</li><li> In a sense this is what happens between Lord Vincent Stanton and his cousin Adrienne in the Satanic Gothic romance <em>Lord Satan</em> by Janet Louise Roberts. Adrienne is seventeen, has lived a working-class life, educated by her father; now he's just died and she's prepared to earn her own living. Vincent, who appears to be about forty, invites her to live with him. He treats her as more of a daughter at first. Since she's so young and likes fairy tales and "toys" (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetYourMindOutOfTheGutter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetYourMindOutOfTheGutter">objets d'art</a></em>), he infantilizes her and calls her "child" and "little girl". She's just lost her father, so responds as younger than she is. As they fall in love he begins to see she really is a woman and respects her judgment; she realizes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">he is a devil</a>, but actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanIsGood">devoted to justice and healing</a>, and she stands up for herself on the matter of joining Satanic cults and the like.

</li><li> Raven in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Black Company</a></em> has this come up accidentally. When Darling, the little girl he sort-of adopted and raised in hiding, becomes a young woman she starts crushing on him (as basically the only man she knows). After arranging other guardians he fakes his death and makes a run for it when he figures out what's happening.

An oracle tells Seregil that he "will be father, brother, friend, and lover" to his 16-year-old new apprentice Alec, and that Alec is "his child now" (i.e., his responsibility). Seregil's reaction is basically to admit to the "father/brother" part in a metaphorical sense (Alec had been recently orphaned when Seregil found him and needed a bit of mature guidance still, and Seregil introduced him to society as his legal ward in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">cover identity</a>),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3rzwq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3rzwq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3rzwq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> makes the reader wonder how he can be so sure about the lack of blood relation, though.

So how can they be sure that the human man Alec thinks was his dad didn't simply adopt him? Until Alec actually gets a vision of his 'faie mother 2 years after the beginning of their romantic relationship, that is.</span> and he happily embraces the label "friend." But he gets squicked at the very idea of "lover", for a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing">Unequal Pairing</a> reasons as well as at the juxtaposition with "father/brother". Fast forward to a year later in book 2, when Alec has a couple of sexual experiences with women (which Seregil had been encouraging), and Seregil finds himself falling for the youth despite his own better judgment.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43cbj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note43cbj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43cbj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though he keeps that entirely to himself until Alec makes it extremely clear that he's fallen in love as well and not inclined to wait any longer by forcefully kissing Seregil.</span>

Abijah and Bathsheba adopted the protagonist Clorinda while she was a young orphan. When she is 16, Mormon prophet Brigham Young asks Abijah and Clorinda to marry.

A year after Dr. Petrie marries Fu Manchu's former servant Karameneh, their daughter is born, but she supposedly dies when she's just three weeks old. It turns out she was kidnapped by Fu Manchu or one of his servants, and raised for the purpose of bearing a son for him when she's old enough (he specifically states that no romance is intended, just using her to bear his child). This is thwarted when she meets and falls for Alan Sterling (the narrator of <em>The Bride of Fu Manchu</em>) instead, and Fu Manchu, seeing his plan has effectively been sabotaged (however unintended), releases her to be with him.

<ul><li> Not averted at all according to some opinions. They were married, but Xerxes took her anyway. She was basically raped for the remainder of her marriage' to the king. This is the actual reason she did not want to go to the king in the Book of Esther; until that point she had never gone to him willingly. If you want to talk Good Adultery... After that she was forbidden to Mordechai though. (And since they may have continued to be together up until that point, Darius' parentage suddenly falls into question...)
</li></ul></li><li> The Rite of Ordination/Holy Orders Sacrament for Catholicism is placed in the same category as Matrimony. Where the ideal of Matrimony is to devote yourself to a single partner, the ideal of Holy Orders is to devote yourself to the Church and Christ and to be celibate. Taking the Rite is often described, not surprisingly, as marrying the Church or marrying Christ himself. The only real exception to the rule is that Permanent Deacons, in certain circumstances, can remarry if they are widowers (perhaps having been left as a single parent) or, occasionally, a man can become a Deacon and keep his wife. Anyone higher ranked than that can't take a partner (this is partially in place to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">Nepotism</a>.

<ul><li> It's hinted that Katisha had also tried to do this with the much younger Nanki-Poo.
</li><li> They do it again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Iolanthe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Iolanthe">Iolanthe</a></em>, where the Lord Chancellor eventually convinces himself that he can marry his ward Phyllis. He doesn't get to, though.
<ul><li> The weird version, deliberately contrasting with the authors' other "straight" examples. The Chancellor is portrayed as a sympathetic rather than manipulative figure and didn't actually raise Phyllis. Being the legal guardian for orphans in the region is part of his government position. Even his self-stated "susceptibility" to teenage girls ends up justified, as in the back of his mind he's never forgotten his apparent teenage wife who died a quarter-century earlier.

</li></ul></li><li> Used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere">Molière</a>'s comedies <em>School for Wives</em> and <em>School for Husbands</em>, where in both cases a male character has a female ward they plan to marry — this doesn't end up working in either case, as the girls confront their patrons and earn their freedoms. By the way, in <em>School for Wives</em>, the man's definition of "perfect" is "as idiot as possible".
<ul><li> Ironically, while the would-be husbands are the butt of the comedy in both plays, Molière himself <em>did</em> end up marrying a girl who had been a young member of his theatre company, and was rumoured to be the daughter of his long-term mistress (scholars now think she was probably her niece). They even played the lead roles in the first public performance of <em>School for Wives</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This plot is lampshaded and averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImportanceOfBeingEarnest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImportanceOfBeingEarnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>, as while Jack/Ernest has his excessively pretty ward Cecily being raised in the countryside like male characters in similar comedies, he is not interested in a romantic relationship with her. His best friend, however, is.
</li><li> In Beaumarchais' play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville">The Barber of Seville</a></em> (and the operas based on it, of which Rossini's is the most famous), Doctor Bartholo plots to marry his ward Rosine (Bartolo and Rosina in Rossini). Count Almaviva and Figaro foil the plot. In the play, it's implied that it's just because she has been left a large dowry by her natural family and he wants to keep it for himself. When he realises the man she eloped with is very rich and will let him keep it, he's contented. However, Rossini's opera suggests that Bartolo has some real attraction to Rosina too, as he proclaims that he only becomes more charmed with her the more scornful she becomes of him.
</li><li> The plot to Arthur Miller's <em>A View From the Bridge.</em> However, Eddie Carbone cannot admit to himself or anyone else that he has romantic feelings towards Catherine, his wife's sister's daughter. Every time someone hints he might have "too much love" for Catherine, he says he isn't that kind of person. Tragedy results.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ALittleNightMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ALittleNightMusic">A Little Night Music</a></em>, but partially averted.

</li><li> In the 17th-century play <em>The London Cuckolds</em>, one of the title characters has a girl raised in the country to be so much of an idiot that she'll believe just about <em>anything</em> anyone tells her (except that she does know trees don't have rats on them), and when he brings her to town to be his wife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> (no, really). Initially he doesn't plan to consummate the marriage, telling her instead her "wifely duties" are to guard his nightcap in full armor, but the two main characters of the play end up interfering with that plan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheLionInWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheLionInWinter">The Lion in Winter</a></em>, Henry has raised Alais with the intention of making her his daughter-in-law, though she becomes his mistress in the meantime.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a></em>, this is a possible interpretation of Canio and Nedda's marriage, as we learn that Nedda was an orphaned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchin</a> whom Canio took in.

Basically, it involves taking a child-Sim away from its parents, and sending it to live in the same house as an adult Sim, who from then on takes care of it and acts as a surrogate parent. When the child grows to be an adult, the relationship score should be high enough for them to fall in love and marry.

He had been raised in the Palace together with Catherine's illegitimate son (as well as her future twelfth lover, Zubov).

</li><li> The notorious Chinese pirate Ching Shih took over the pirating business after her husband died, and then married her adopted son Cheung Po Tsai (modern Pinyin: Zhang Baozai). Supposedly, Cheung Po Tsai was also the lover of both Ching Shih and her husband after they adopted him at the age of 15.
</li><li> Due to the infamous one-child policy in China, and the accompanying widespread infanticide of infant girls, there are now people who do this so their sons can have wives. It's pervasive enough that there are now detectives whose entire careers are dedicated to finding people's daughters and bringing them back... just as there are people who make livings kidnapping and selling girls for wives.

In his younger days he pined after Maude Gonne, who spurned him and married an abusive monster named John MacBride. After John MacBride's death Maude still refused Yeats' offers of marriage, so he finally proposed to Iseult Gonne, Maude's illegitimate daughter, who was born before her marriage to MacBride (he was 52 and she was 23). She turned him down, but apparently they became good friends and Yeats was something of a father figure to her.

Present at the birth (aside from Vanessa's husband!) was Grant's lover David Garnett, who afterwards wrote to a friend, "I think of marrying it. When she is 20, I shall be 46  will it be scandalous?". When Angelica Bell was in her early twenties, she did marry Garnett, who had remained a close friend of her parents.

</li><li> Speaking of Rousseau, he was taken in by Françoise-Louise de Warens when he was 15 and she was 29; he thought of her as his <em>maman,</em> but they became lovers when he was 20.
</li><li> Philippe de Mezières' "Letter to Richard II" contains a section arguing for this practice. It's pretty creepy to read (it uses comparisons such as animal training and bending saplings), but isn't really evidence for medieval opinions on marital best practices as a general rule; the main goal was to persuade Richard to accept the French's offer of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">peace treaty</a> whose terms would include his marriage to Isabel, the daughter of Charles VI of France. (The argument for marrying an underage girl doesn't come up until the last section.) Richard did marry Isabel in 1396, when he was 29 and she was 6 — an unusually young age even for a medieval bride — as he was also interested in ending the war (although it was in an "off" stage at the moment), and probably wanted more time to grieve his (age-appropriate) first wife, with whom he had had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a> until her death in 1394, although he had to remarry because they had never had children. The terms of the treaty included a number of stipulations for what to do if one of them decided they didn't want to consummate the marriage when Isabel was of age. The decision wasn't terribly popular among the nobility, many of whom preferred to continue the war (and also wanted the succession locked down). At any rate, Richard was deposed and murdered before any of that became an issue.
<ul><li> This was quite common among medieval nobility - not for reasons of the men commonly having a sexual interest in barely pubescent girls, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> makes it come across, but primarily to 'secure' the inheritance (primarily land) of an orphaned girl with no brothers in the hands of some man. The consummation of the marriage was supposed to wait until the girl actually was old enough to bear children.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5y7cx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5y7cx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5y7cx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While both girls and boys were used as bargaining chips in political/trade deals by their families as soon as they were legally able to consent to the holy rite of marriage according to the Catholic church (age 12), no matter how physically developed they were at that point, records of the frequently visibly-pregnant brides at parish churches in England suggest that peasant girls usually didn't marry (and thus deprived their birth family of their labour) until they got pregnant by their boyfriend at the age of about 20.</span> (Which is only sensible, if you consider that a barely pubescent mother would have a much higher risk of dying during the birth and taking the all-important heir with her.) Eleanor of Aquitaine was orphaned at 12 or 15 (her birth year is uncertain) and was married by the King of France 3 months later, but didn't have any children until she was at least 19. Later on, she married the more age-appropriate Henry II, King of England, and they then took her ex-husband's daughter (from his next wife) Alys in as a ward when she was 8, with plans of marrying her to one of their sons (Richard III). But somewhere during the raising of that girl, Henry II apparently took her as his mistress instead (at least there were widespread rumors, prompting the Pope to push for the wedding sooner rather than later) and then Henry II died and Eleanor prevented the marriage from going through. There are exceptions to the waiting rule, of course, like Margaret Beaufort, whose father died in battle when she was just a baby. The king then gave her wardship to a noble whom her father hadn't intended for the role, who almost immediately married her (aged between 1 and 3 years old) to his own son (age 2). However, this marriage was dissolved 3 years later and Margaret never considered it legal.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6e6m0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6e6m0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6e6m0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Because she hadn't been 12 years of age yet, which was the Catholic Church's age of consent at the time - and girls did have to give their "I do" freely (at least freely if you're not considering family pressure, etc.), as opposed to earlier Germanic/Pagan customs when bride abduction was considered a legal way to marriage, just like in was in a number of other ancient cultures.</span> Her wardship was then won by another noble, who apparently successfully groomed her, because when he (age 24) finally married her (age 12), this marriage was the one she always considered her 'true' marriage and she made sure she would be buried beside him some 50-odd years later. In any case, this was in the War of the Roses and people were dying left and right, so he quickly impregnated her, then got captured by an enemy and died of the plague before the baby was even born. This child was the man who later won the English throne from Richard III and so became Henry VII - and the birth at the mother's underdeveloped age of 13 was so traumatic that she never got pregnant again<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7gbci');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7gbci" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7gbci');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">I.e., her womb must have been destroyed by the ordeal, because "marital duties" were not something either spouse could refuse in medieval Europe - non-performance by the husband was one of the very few reasons for which the wife could get a marriage annulled - since producing children was considered the primary purpose of marriage and sex.</span>, despite surviving another 2 husbands after this.

</li><li> The second wife of famous Polish astronomer, merchant and one-time Mayor of Gdansk Jan Hevelius, Katharina Elisabeth Koopman, was a daughter of his neighbor Nicholas Koopman and 36 years his younger. Fascinated by the astronomy, she became Hevelius' student, and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">grew infatuated with her teacher</a>, finally marrying him after his first wife died. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">She was sixteen at the time, Hevelius more than fifty</a>, but for all indications they were pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>, jointly practicing astronomy and managing Hevelius' family brewing business.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>, Mandukhai Khatun adopted a young boy named Batu Mongke (said to be the last living legitimate descendant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>) and saved his life after an early childhood of illness and neglect and raised him to be her husband, the eventual Dayan Khan. Mandukhai was at least 15 years his senior and had already been married and widowed by the time she adopted him, but by all accounts their marriage was a happy one since and they even opted to stay together after it would have been possible to separate without negative consequences due to her being past reproductive age, and together they reunited Mongolia.
</li><li> Thomas Day had no luck getting a woman to marry him, so he and his friend John Bicknell arranged to take on two foundling girls as apprentices to their friend, Richard Edgeworth. He renamed the girls Sabrina and Lucretia and moved them to France to be taught in isolation along the lines Rousseau recommended. He decided Lucretia wasn't smart enough and dismissed her. Then he moved Sabrina back to England and began tutoring her himself, doing things like dripping hot wax on her arms to teach her stoicism and firing blanks at her skirts to teach her calm nerves. Edgeworth eventually convinced him that the experiment was not successful, and Day sent her off to a boarding house, then eventually hired her as a housekeeper. He ended up proposing marriage, which she accepted, but then called it off when she turned out not to be as meek and obedient as he preferred. She went back to the boarding house where Bicknell found her, told her of the original plan, and after she confronted Day through a series of letters and received confirmation but no apology, proposed to her. Bicknell and Sabrina married, started a family, and Bicknell died a few years later. Someone published a book about Sabrina, and Edgeworth followed up by publishing his own memoirs, stating that Sabrina had always loved Day. Sabrina publicly denied this, saying she was miserable with Day, and that he treated her like a slave. After she was widowed, both Day and Edgeworth contributed to a small yearly stipend. After Day's death, his widow continued the stipend. Sabrina found work as housekeeper for Charles Burney and became the general manager of his three schools. She lived to the ripe old age of 86 and asked that no one bring up her humble beginnings or Day's treatment of her.
