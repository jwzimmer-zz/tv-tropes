Not helping is that Shampoo quite vocally loves Ranma. Mousse blames his entire failure to win Shampoo's heart on Ranma's existence, and devotes himself to defeating Ranma in hopes of annulling the engagement. The facts that Ranma didn't <em>want</em> Shampoo's hand in marriage, that Ranma generally would be happy to give Shampoo to Mousse, and that Shampoo wanted nothing to do with Mousse for years before either of them knew Ranma existed fails to dissuade Mousse from his resentment. Ironically, outside of this field, Mousse normally doesn't give a damn about Ranma—unlike Ryoga, who is generally willing to blame everything wrong in his life on Ranma.

Despite this, Guts still goes out of his way for her and is, in fact, still deeply in love with Casca and is striving to find a cure for her insanity. However, Farnese has feelings for Guts, and although she knows that it is highly unlikely that he will ever reciprocate her affection, she at least wants his merit in the group as a witch in training.

Jason Todd also resents Tim for replacing him and, from his perspective, helping Bruce forget about Jason and the revenge he feels owed. This means that out of the three brothers Tim gained when Bruce adopted him, two have made multiple attempts on his life.

Meanwhile, Creed is called an animal and looked down on for having the same qualities everyone seems to love in Logan. It's been outright stated by Creed, and shown on a few different occasions.

Reed has everything Doom doesn't <em>quite</em> have: a family, loyal friends, public acknowledgement, admiration from people who aren't brainwashed subjects of his own dictatorship, good looks (which Doom once <em>had</em>, and blames Richards for their destruction), acknowledgment as a hero, and most important of all, a handful more IQ points, which he has used to defeat Doom and foil his plans time and time again.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Severus Snape is the series' biggest example of this. He resents and <em>loathes</em> James for a variety of reasons: James and Sirius bullied Snape at Hogwarts; jealousy of James being the star of Hogwarts, a skilled student, and a talented athlete; James growing up with a loving family while Snape had an abusive father and neglectful mother; and James saving Snape's life, for which James was lauded — even by Lily, Snape's best, dearest, and only friend. However, things really come to a head when Snape realizes James likes Lily — the only girl Snape has ever loved. While Lily loved Snape, it was only as a friend and nothing more. In turn, James resented Snape, albeit to a lesser extent, because of Snape's friendship with Lily despite Snape being... well, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>. They each demonstrate open hostility of each other, both thinking that the other is the biggest jerk to ever walk the planet and both having a deep affection for Lily. When Lily eventually falls in love with James, this seals Snape's extreme resentment of James forever.
</li><li> Harry's Aunt Petunia resented her sister Lily becoming a witch, but it goes back and forth between whether she thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsEvil">Magic Is Evil</a>, or that she was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">envious of Lily</a> for getting to Hogwarts when she didn't (and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>). Much like Snape, she carried that resentment toward Lily's son Harry.
</li><li> Draco Malfoy's motivations are never entirely clear, but it's strongly implied that he resents Harry's fame and his inability to rope Harry into his own social circle. This usually manifests itself in him mocking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">unpleasant aspects of Harry's celebrity</a> and generally spending more time than he should trying to upstage him.
</li><li> Ron Weasley is an interesting example because he has to fight through the temptation to become a Resenter throughout the whole series. He's the youngest son in a large family of talented children who are either remarkable or accomplished, resulting in Ron feeling like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>. His family is poor, which others mock him for, while his best friend is rich. Ron is Harry's best friend, but it is Harry whom people notice and pay attention to while Ron feels like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>. This escalates in the later books as he struggles with his feelings toward Hermione, who is both remarkably talented and intelligent, while she also harbors feelings toward Ron. Ron struggles both with his feelings of resentment and emotions born from it and often keeps them inside (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Stiff Upper Lip</a> in British culture would account for why they don't just talk it out). Despite all of this and a few spats between them, Ron remains Harry's closest friend and eventually overcomes these issues. (Fandom, on the other hand, loves playing up this resentment so much that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">named a trope</a>.)
</li><li> Aberforth Dumbledore resented his brother from the time they were teenagers until Albus's death partially because he's lived his entire life in the shadow of the greatest wizard of the era and mostly because he pretty directly caused the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their sister</span>.

When Joshua and Biff meet John (Josh's some number of cousin some number of times removed), he's convinced he's the Messiah and has taken to aggressively baptizing younger kids. When Biff and Josh tell him that Josh (Jesus) is the Messiah, and that he's actually mostly raised the dead, John wants to be absolutely sure... and is then grateful to have that load off his shoulders. He wants to help Josh, though, so he keeps baptizing people.
</li><li> Lucifer is portrayed as this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> series, resenting the worship that he felt belonged to him as God's "anointed cherub" being given to God and His only begotten Son Jesus Christ instead, which led to his rebellion and being cast down to Earth.

Basically, Saruman was the guy people would visit only when they wanted something, while Gandalf was the guy people would invite to parties.

They each teach Chiyo and Pumpkin to become top-ranking geisha. Initially, Chiyo and Pumpkin are good friends but, because they're being taught by geisha who are rivals to <em>each other</em> and want to get their "little sisters" on top (Chiyo and Pumpkin) as part of their rivalry, Chiyo and Pumpkin's friendship is effectively ended. Despite this, Chiyo and Pumpkin remain on good terms until Chiyo, now named Sayuri, becomes so successful that she displaces Hatsumomo as the breadwinner for the okiya, and is adopted by the woman who owns it as her daughter and heir, while Hatsumomo's career goes down the drain. However, unfortunately (and tragically) Sayuri never realises that by getting rid of Hatsumomo, she's effectively torpedoed Pumpkin's chance to be a very successful geisha. Pumpkin not only realises this, but she becomes very angry at Sayuri as time passes.

It's brought up that he could have renewed his addresses after gaining his own command but chose not to, and when he returns as a rich captain he talks a whole lot about how he thinks firmness of mind is the most important trait in a woman while flirting with the spirited Louisa Musgrove.

<ul><li> A downplayed example with Arya. She resents her sister Sansa for being so effortlessly good at most skills required by their culture while Arya, no matter what she does, simply cannot catch up. Although she is indulged by her parents, her behavior is not as celebrated when compared to Sansa's. Also, Sansa isn't terribly kind to her either as she disapproves of Arya's behavior — but in the vein of typical sibling rivalry.
</li><li> Catelyn resents her husbands illegitimate son, Jon Snow, for several reasons — but it has little to do with Jons own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">character</a>, but with circumstances which have affected her: 1) Jon being Ned's illegitimate son who Ned brings home to raise alongside the trueborn children Catelyn has with Ned; 2) Ned's fierce protectiveness of Jon, who Ned loves and openly acknowledges as his own son. From this, Catelyn concludes that Ned must have loved Jon's mother deeply and when she asks Ned who Jon's mother is, Ned is so intimidating that he actually <em>scares</em> her — leading to her fears that maybe Ned loved Jon's mother more than her; and 3) that Jon looks more like a Stark than any of the children (aside from Arya) she bore Ned, who all inherited more of her features. As a result of Westerosi societal prejudice against illegitimate children and the history of the Blackfyres pretty much being responsible for these negative connotations, Catelyn fears that someday Jon or his children might be a threat to the inheritance claims of her own trueborn children and grandchildren — despite Jon's deep love for his trueborn siblings and loyalty to them (unbeknownst to her, Jon ends up turning down inheriting Winterfell). In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">television adaptation</a>, she admits that she was unfair to Jon, who she recognizes is an innocent child, and feels guilty over it. In the book series itself, she never interferes in the close bonds Jon shares with his half-siblings and she has moments of softness wherein she wonders if Jon's mother prays for him as she prays for Robb.
<div class="indent">Whoever Jons mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Neds sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse.
</div></li><li> Stannis, whose status as the least-popular Baratheon, a string of achievements that were ignored, the main reward he <em>did</em> get being custody of a barren rock miles from anywhere (admittedly also the traditional seat of the rightful heir), and a lengthy list of other grievances, have combined to produce a bitter and rigid man. And his incredible memory means he can't just <em>forget</em> them. He still manages to be one of the more honourable claimants to the Iron Throne, though.

Before he left, Willam swore to his bride that he would return to her riding the horse she had given him as a wedding present; however, Willam was killed on the mission, and Ned returned the horse to his widow, but not the corpse of her husband.

It's difficult to pin his resentment on any one event without bringing in almost every personality trait of Cain's, but in a quick comparison, Cain is fun-loving, mischievous, not particularly pious, incredibly likable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a>, and frequently tackled Beije whenever a scrumball game came up (to be fair, so did <em>every</em> scrumball player opposing him, Beije's attitude never won him many friends). As of him growing up, not much of that changed, through he also seemed decidedly slack on discipline (In other words, he wasn't a trigger-happy task master) in his regiment, and appeared to spend a significant amount of time away from his official duties as a commissar. Beije is... none of those things, and was devoutly religious and a tattletale. However, one of them was stuck with an unremarkable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Tallarn</a> unit, while another happens to be regarded as one of the Imperium's greatest heroes, and is the current Commissar to the famed Valhallan 597th. Given the title, you can probably guess which is which. Eventually, Beije attempts to discredit Cain, due to his jealousy over Cain getting everything handed to him and having everything come easy. This backfires spectacularly: by bringing a Tallarn squad to arrest Cain for desertion (because Cain is investigating a ritual site instead of fighting on the front lines), he only ensures Cain has plenty of witnesses to testify that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cain was right to suspect daemonic influence when Emeli returns as a daemon princess, and that Cain fought off her easily fought off her seductions before defeating her, while Beije underwent minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> when she touched him</span>.

He was a lock for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, until dark horse candidate Bartlet came out of nowhere and started winning primaries — with the help of a team that included Josh Lyman, formerly Hoynes's most trusted lieutenant. Worse, after Bartlet got the nomination, Hoynes was insulted by the offer of the VP slot, and accepted it largely on the understanding that it would be "his turn" next time (and that "next time" would come after only one term, because of Bartlet's MS).

<ul><li> In a nice bit of irony, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> caused by Danny meddling in the past, he does marry Maddie, but turns out to be a controlling husband who refuses to let her do ghost hunting related activities because it reminds him of Jack. Yes, even when he gets what he wants, he's <em>still</em> resentful.
</li></ul></li><li> Tucker Foley, but to a lesser extent. Prior to obtaining his ghost powers, Danny was on equal grounds with Tucker. The two were best friends who shared everything. Then Danny gets all the awesome powers and Tucker is stuck being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>. One episode showed him acting on his resentment via an (unintentional) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">deadly wish</a> that nearly had him kill Danny.
<ul><li> Indeed, seeing the monster his wish had created helps Tucker move past this trope.

Remy only has the one godparent, and his real parents are so obsessed with making money that they spend just two minutes a day with him and <em>don't even know his name</em>. In later appearances, he seems to be motivated by petty vengeance and sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkassery</a> more than anything else.
</li><li> I.R. Baboon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel">I Am Weasel</a></em> resents Weasel's fame and considers himself better, even though Weasel is a certified genius, whereas Baboon is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">well, not</a>.
</li><li> In the backstory to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Princess Luna's resentment over her subjects always sleeping through the night, her time of reign, while frolicking and working during the day when her sister ruled, led to her becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Nightmare Moon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds">bringing forth eternal night</a>. This gets revisited in the Season 7 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem">A Royal Problem</a>", where it's revealed both sisters have some resentment for one another (so it wasn't just Luna being envious of Celestia's life).
<ul><li> Sunset Shimmer, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em>, clearly resents Twilight Sparkle, because she managed to earn everything Sunset desired: adoration, power, and an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alicorn princess position</span>. This becomes evident when Twilight's friends praise her for her loyalty and fortitude while she grows closer and closer to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> with every word spoken. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luckily, she pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and appears to grow out of it by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Rainbow Rocks</a></em>, learning to accept her loss and instead embracing what she has now: The human versions of the Mane Six and alicorn!Twilight as her friends, the true respect of Canterlot High, and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">sweet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchTelepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchTelepathy">magical powers</a> on the side.</span>
</li><li> Though her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> was the result of half the Mane Six ruining her show and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">two obnoxious fans</a> causing an incident that ruined her career, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Trixie</a> would ultimately come to resent Twilight Sparkle for apparently having the power she doesn't. This would last through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> and then well into <em>Season Six</em> before she would finally drop the grudge. Ironically, the reason she drops the grudge is <em>because</em> of the grudge: she befriends someone to spite Twilight Sparkle, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">the friendship becomes genuine</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Starlight Glimmer</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Season 5 has this and then some. It was bad enough that she had already developed deep-rooted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain">social</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">issues</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">resulting</a> from a broken friendship as a filly, which deeply traumatized her. Meeting the Mane Six, Twilight Sparkle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">most especially</a>, just sent her over the edge. When the Mane Six thwarted her in the Season 5 premiere, she spent the <em>entire season</em> tracking them down and plotting her revenge against them. Starlight didn't care about why or what it would lead to, she despised Twilight and her friends that much. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Revealing that this is what Starlight greatly desired: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">Friends</a>. But her resentment for the Mane Six is so deep she still needs more talking down even after being shown the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">horrible consequences</a> of her actions. Fortunately, Twilight Sparkle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">managed to get through</a> to Starlight enough to finally make her let go of her resentment and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">give friendship another chance</a>, which she does, ultimately being forgiven and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">becoming friends</a> with the Mane Six</span>.

After Adora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">defection</a> coincided with Catra's recognition for her own talents up to and including Shadow Weaver being forced to give her the promotion planned for Adora, the idea that her own fortunes depended on Adora's defeats took root and metastasized.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Homer's Enemy", Frank Grimes' main character trait is resentment of how well Homer has done for himself despite being, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Homer Simpson</a>, while he has worked hard all his life and gotten nowhere. He might have done better to resent the people who favored Homer over him instead — Mr. Burns especially — since they were so blatant in their hostility toward him, while Homer was merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a>.
</li><li> Plankton of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> has, as his main villainous motivation, resentment of Mr. Krabs's success (and, in turn, the community that <em>made</em> Mr. Krabs a success), especially in comparison to his own restaurant, hence his ongoing attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Also seems to be reversed at times: Krabs at the very least has a rather intense rivalry with Plankton and is obsessed with gloating to his face. Whenever Plankton seems to have even minor success that makes his own resentment fade, Krabs obsessively tries to destroy him, intent on putting him back in his shadow.
</li><li> Initially, Raven appears to be this in regards to Terra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>: angry that Terra has apparently managed to control her powers so easily, while Raven still must meditate constantly to keep hers in check.
