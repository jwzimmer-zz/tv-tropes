</p><p>This trope can also show up in other genres, but its natural stomping grounds are mystery or some kind of procedural.

<ul><li> Lucy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>. Even being a mass murderer with a penchant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smiles</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> isn't enough to keep her from being sympathetic; her backstory is <em>just that crappy</em> that you can't help but want to give her a hug even when she's in the middle of eviscerating some innocent or not-so-innocent soul.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She does seem to rarely but significantly show remorse for her killings at times though, notably before her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> for one thing, and her horror at killing Kouta's family sticks with her even when she's off the deep end.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> seems to like having the murderer be a genuinely nice person put into an unfortunate circumstance, and the victim is such a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> that you don't mind their death. One episode even has a staged kidnapping where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the "victim" didn't mind being kidnapped, and hugged the kidnapper over <em>her own dad</em></span>. Harsh.
<ul><li> Another case involved a man who was in a relationship with an old friend who didn't want to commit, so he broke up with her. Years later, he got engaged to another woman. The first woman returns and has gone full psycho bitch. She's threatening to send photos of them while they were dating and pass them off as if he were cheating. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Too bad both of them happened to be friends of Kogoro Mouri, who is genuinely hurt at the killer's betrayal of his trust and friendship.</span>
</li><li> Another one involves a girl who fell into the wrong crowd and was indirectly involved in a big theft that resulted in the suicide of the person who was burglarized. This caused her to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> and she decided the crowd was terrible, so she went back to school. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, the leader of the gang came back into her life and blackmailed her. All she wanted was to get him out of her life and put that part behind her, so she decided to end it by threatening him away with a knife instead of paying him off. The blackmailer then attacked her and she stabbed him in the struggle.</span> Granted, this wasn't exactly <em>pre-meditated</em> and she <em>did</em> do it in self-defense, but after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssVictim">Jerk Ass Victim</a>, very few people would have not felt sorry for her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even though she <em>did</em> have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and <em>threatened</em> to kill him - still won't get her off the legal hook.</span>
</li><li> One notable case that keeps the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> angle but <em>subverts</em> the sympathetic murderer one involves an old friend of Sonoko's sister taking revenge on another classmate who stole his girlfriend's work and drove her to suicide. He manages to kill her, but then attempts to murder Ran Mouri too, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is pretending to be overweight and Ran accidentally walked into his room while he was changing and saw that he really wasn't, but her glimpse of him was so quick she couldn't properly register everything</span>. After Conan exposes him as the killer he claims he did it all in honor of his girlfriend's memory. Conan states that's a load of bull and exclaims <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">that despite whatever intentions he had, trying to kill Ran was completely unrelated to those as she was innocent of the whole affair, so he's nothing but a complete bastard</a>.
</li><li> Another case that puts a twist on this idea is the Spider Queen mystery. Two men are killed and it's revealed that they were smuggling drugs in the doll-repair business they were running. This also seems to be the reason behind one of the guys' <em>daughter</em> having committed suicide (or even thought to have been murder made to look like suicide), including her father's harsh treatment of her and the murderer is simply "revenging" her death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Completely subverted when it's revealed that the girl <em>did</em> commit suicide and did it because of a note that <em>the murderer</em> had written her years ago. The note said "Shine" like 'to shine' since he was American and she was a beautiful, shining person to him. But she, being Japanese, read it as "shine" ("shee-ne") meaning 'die'... and she did. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">The murderer is heartbroken when he finds this out</a>.</span>
</li><li> You can make another two cases out of <em>Billionaire Birthday Blues</em>. Killing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> responsible for the death of the girl you loved? Simple, BUT <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taping her up and slowly drowning her to force her to have a painful death and on top of it, on her birthday</span>? EVIL. Also, it's clearly seen by the grandmother of the girl that Ran resembles her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ichieda</span> could have chosen to not drag her into part of his plan, yet he still DID. Yes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ichieda</span>, your motive might be sympathetic but your methods are INHUMAN. The grandmother herself even lampshaded this.
</li></ul></li><li> Scar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. Even being a ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who attempted to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> isn't enough to keep him from sympathetic, given that as a genocide survivor he had lost everything he held dear. He also admits that he feels horribly guilty for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Winry's parents, because they were innocents and had saved him</span>.
</li><li> <em>Gokuaku no Hana</em> ("Flower of Carnage") does this with none other than Jagi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> infamy... sort of. Mildly subverted by itself, as that sympathy will be for who he <em>was</em>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alma Karma</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>, who may have had a worse childhood then even Allen!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, Alyssa's boyfriend, Rint, in "Ganymede Elegy" shot and killed a loan shark during a scuffle with the loan shark's muscle to protect Alyssa. Jet implies at the end that he might get off on manslaughter or imperfect self-defence.
</li></ul><ul><li> A few in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> manga
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brock Johnson</span> from Turnabout Gallows killed Robin Wolfe, who had essentially driven Eddie Johnson, the killer's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">younger brother</span> to suicide. Subverted in that no one, especially Robin's daughter, sympathizes with him and she even asks if she's now justified in murdering him.
</li><li> An interesting case occurs in Turnabout From Heaven, in which Diana Wheatley is accused of killing her abusive father, Buck. Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> Edgeworth lampshades this trope, saying that he sympathizes with her, but she must pay for her crime. However, Phoenix works, as always, to poke holes in the case, leading the suspicion to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diana's mother, Dreama,</span> who would be a case, as it is initially thought that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">killed Buck for harming Diana</a>.</span> But in the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Buck's death was not the result of murder at all, as his cat came into contact with buckwheat, and accidentally caused him to ingest some, causing him to die of an allergic reaction</span>.
</li><li> The final case of the Miles Edgeworth side involves such a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> that was tarnishing a local clinic's reputation and extorting money from it (in the form of free treatments) that nobody is surprised when he's killed. The killer ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being a young man whose life had been saved at that clinic and couldn't stand seeing how much the victim's extortion was hurting the doctor both emotionally and financially.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The murderer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (or, rather, murderers)</span> in the Academy arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>, especially compared to earlier antagonists, can come off as this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Greenhill didn't plan to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Derrick Arden</a>, but the sight of him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">beating up younger students</a> and having it covered up by the vice principal incensed him enough for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntLikeMeWhenImAngry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntLikeMeWhenImAngry">loss of control</a> with a cricket bat. His fellow Prefects helped take out the VP and cover up the incident, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">to preserve</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToTradition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToTradition">the school's reputation.</a></span> Still murder, but almost jarringly non-evil for a series with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>, as is promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by a burst of laughter from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Undertaker</span> at Ciel's faked horror.
</li><li> A completely unexpected and unusual example comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Colossal Titan, Armored Titan, and the Female Titan all turn out to be sympathetic once their <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentitiy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentitiy">Secret Identitiies</a> are revealed. Although they are mass murderers responsible for much of the death in the series, they're also guilt-ridden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bombs</a> that have been deeply traumatized by what they've been forced to do. Reiner claims that they were just "stupid kids" that didn't understand anything, while Bertolt makes it clear that they don't have any choice and it <em>has</em> to be done.

<ul><li> The story <em>The Sweet Death</em> has a very strange example: the victim had survived an attempted murder at the hands of his cheating wife and her lover but was so crippled that he could only blink. So, when he accidentally met Diabolik, he asked to be mercy-killed and avenged. After securing the loot, Diabolik killed him and framed his wife and her lover in a way that would lead them to get sentenced to death and executed.

Not until after she has been executed, does Samson discover the motive for the murder. She killed the man because he had been beating his wife, who was an old friend of Crazy Eight from high school. The wife actually killed (or helped kill) her husband, the vigilante actually took the blame and died in her place, knowing it was unlikely that the wife would get a fair trial given her husband's position of power and the powerful friends he had that helped cover up the abuse. Crazy Eight sacrificed her life for her friend.

<ul><li> The first culprit, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaito Fujiwara</span>, cracked under pressure and felt paranoid.

</li><li> Creepily played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BasicInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BasicInstinct">Basic Instinct</a></em>. Catherine Trammell indirectly seems to be tired of male chauvinism. It's more explicitly implied in the reason Roxy killed her brothers and father.
</li><li> <em>Red Dragon</em> plays up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDragon">the book's</a> depiction of Francis Dolarhyde as someone who is not so much a man who does not enjoy his serial killing as a Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personalities)-riddled individual whose alternate personality bullies him into committing his atrocities. For the most part-Dolarhyde is only sympathetic if the titular dragon was really an alternate personality and not just a personification of his homicidal urges. The ending really suggests that the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">deceleration</a> of his violent impulses, culminating in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to spare Reba</span>, was really Dolarhyde <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">hamming it up</a> as part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to kill Will's family</span>. It can't all be an act though. At first, he genuinely does want to prevent the Dragon (or the homicidal aspect of his own psyche, whichever) from harming Reba, and in the novel comes really close to suicide because of it. The fact that he eats the painting proves that. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">Motive Decay</a> kicks in when, in a spectacular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he sees Reba kissing Mandy</span>. At that point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">he takes a flying leap off the sanity wagon</a>, and decides that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery">a massive Graham-related killing spree</a> is in order. The Dolarhyde of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter">Manhunter</a></em>, on the other hand, really is sympathetic.

</li><li> The titular serial killer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrBrooks">Mr. Brooks</a></em> is a massive example, this trope being the focus of the entire film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monster">Monster</a></em>, Aileen Wournos murders seven men, but it's understandable because she suffered so many cruelties in life (e.g., rape, poverty, prostitution, discrimination).
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actual</span> murderer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GosfordPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GosfordPark">Gosford Park</a></em>, who does it to prevent someone <em>else</em> becoming a murderer to avenge her rape.
</li><li> The mentally unstable George Loomis (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephCotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephCotten">Joseph Cotten</a>) from the 1953 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Niagara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Niagara">Niagara</a></em>. His wife (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>) and her lover are plotting his murder (after, it is implied, deliberately driving him mad), but the plot backfires and Loomis kills the lover in self-defense. Later, he vengefully murders his wife and is overcome with remorse. At the end of the film, while trapped with an innocent girl in a boat hurtling toward the edge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NiagaraFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NiagaraFalls">Niagara Falls</a>, he helps her climb safely out onto a rock before falling to his death over the edge, possibly making this an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a>.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> is a very deeply disturbed man, and the movie is directed in such a way as to elicit sympathy from the audience after he kills Marion. In the end, he becomes a figure of pity and is stated to not really be responsible for his own actions. The later sequels reveal he was sent to a mental institution.
</li><li> This trope was rather oddly zigzagged in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848551/">KillerKiller (2007)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which the girl doing all the on-screen killing was actually not such a sympathetic character, but some of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> victims managed to be, due in part to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>—which is not to say they weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">asshole victims</a> or that viewers were going to be too sorry to see some of them die.

</li><li> Carl Lee Hailey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATimeToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATimeToKill">A Time to Kill</a></em> (and the book it's based on, naturally), so very much. He hid inside the local courthouse so he could commit premeditated murder against two men-redneck racists who kidnapped, raped and attempted to murder Carl's daughter and were likely to escape punishment for their crime unless Carl resorted to vigilantism.
</li><li> The woman Harry Callahan pursued in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuddenImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuddenImpact">Sudden Impact</a></em> was the victim of a gang rape who is killing off her rapists one by one. It's notable for including a rare example of a female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> and even rarer example of a female rapist (the same victim).
</li><li> In the 1993 film <em>Desperate Justice</em>, also known as <em>A Mother's Revenge</em>, a 12-year-old girl named Wendy is raped and beaten by a janitor at her school that she trusted. Which is not a spoiler since it happens early in the film and kicks off the entire plot. The spoiler, and where this trope comes into play, is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the janitor's case was dismissed by the judge, in large part because his mother lied about having dinner with him at the time of the murder. This (combined with the janitor smiling and laughing about the ruling) pisses Wendy's mother off so much that <em>she shoots and murders the janitor</em> at the trial, and she is then the sympathetic murderer for the rest of the film. The main "plot" of the film then centers around whether the mother is really sympathetic or whether she's no better than the janitor</span>.

Murders his ex-lover in a jealous moment of passion, and kidnaps the only witness, 11-year-old Gillie, but is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a> who strikes up an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a> with his hostage and exhibits genuine remorse.

He may be a convicted murderer himself, but he's hardly an unsympathetic one. Even Sister Helen Prejean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">sympathizes with him</a> when she helps to be a spiritual adviser for him.

He caps off his spree by killing the very person who triggered it—the man who murdered his wife and daughter.
</li><li> The Dutch movie <em>TBS</em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobieish</a> convicted murderer who has been confined to a mandatory mental health clinic for criminals for allegedly murdering his father and sister.

Over the course of the film, it becomes clear that he's a genuinely delusional psychotic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ending up killing both his mother and the girl. He doesn't gain any pleasure from this whatsoever and voluntarily returns to prison at the end</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sweetwater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sweetwater">Sweetwater</a></em>: Sarah's killing spree is understandable after what she's been through, even if not all of her victims were that bad.

</li><li> Some of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em>s killings would fit the legal definition of murder. Considering his victims are invariably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">terrorists, gangsters, evil masterminds and other such scum</a>, it's unlikely any jury would convict.

It turned out to have been done by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own mother, who was a witness to the man murdering his wife in cold blood</span>.
</li><li> A rule of thumb for Agatha Christie is that around 80% of sympathetic murderers are terminally ill so that the protagonist can feel comfortable with not turning them in. If you're a Sympathetic Murderer who wants to <em>live</em>, you better be <em>really</em> justified.
</li></ul></li><li> Caroline Clive's <em>Paul Ferroll</em> and <em>Why Paul Ferroll Killed His Wife</em> both feature a nice Victorian gentleman who did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> had to deal with a few of these.
<ul><li> <em>A Study In Scarlet</em>. The victims had been responsible for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> that involved kidnapping the bride, killing her father in the process and leading to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">Death by Despair</a>. Her true love had finally tracked them down and killed them.
</li><li> In the short story "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> was a drunken, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">abusive husband</a>; the Sympathetic Murderer was actually guilty either of manslaughter or self-defense, since the husband attacked him when he caught him talking with his wife, but the circumstances made it look <em>very</em> bad.
</li><li> In the short story "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot", the first set of crimes is avenged by one of these.
</li><li> In the short story "The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge", the actual victim was a would-be Sympathetic Murderer who was killed by his target (an ex-dictator who had killed the victim's father, among others). It is strongly implied that more successful Sympathetic Murderers caught up with the target in the end.
</li><li> In the case of Charles Augustus Milverton, Holmes and Watson actually witness the murder of the title character, an utterly odious blackmailer, but opt not to report it. a) They were burgling the man's house at the time, making it difficult to explain how they saw the crime committed; and b) Holmes has a great deal of sympathy with anyone who was a victim of the blackmailer striking back at him, and c) the killer is implied to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> royalty</span>.
</li><li> In "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box," the killer is a sailor who murdered his wife and her lover in a fit of passion, then cut off their ears and mailed them to his wife's sister, who had encouraged the affair. He's sympathetic not because of what he did, but because he clearly regrets it and was in fact deeply in love with his wife; he even says that he would have spared her life if she hadn't started wailing over her dead lover's body.
</li><li> In "The Boscombe Valley Mystery", the killer murdered a blackmailer - mostly to protect his daughter. According to his words, if the innocent suspect had been sentenced by the court, he would have confessed to the murder. And he was terminally ill.

<ul><li> The short story "Overheard on a Balcony", in which more than one person tried to kill the victim on the same evening, mainly because he was an absolute bastard and a blackmailer.
</li><li> The finale of <em>Murder in Montparnasse</em> can be considered to invoke this trope - the victim had committed at least three murders, and at least two of the investigations had been botched, so various parties took matters into their own hands.
</li><li> <em>Murder in the Dark</em>: the various attempts on the life of Gerald Templar are eventually traced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his long-suffering, unappreciated butler/business manager</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>Dead Man's Chest</em>: The death of Mrs. McNaster is revealed to be murder, done by Bridget, one of the housemaids who'd had enough of how Mrs. McNaster abused her companion.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Disturbing as it may be, one cannot help but feel at least a little pity for the two killers described in Truman Capote's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InColdBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InColdBlood">In Cold Blood</a></em>. In fact, this may have been what Capote was going for, as he spent a lot of time with the killers when he was researching for the book (especially Perry Smith who, depending on your perspective, may have had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>) and began to sympathize with them.

However, what pushed her over the brink wasn't her husband's treatment of her, it was his treatment of their children (emotional abuse of one son, sexual abuse of their daughter, and cleaning out the college savings accounts Dolores had worked long and hard to build up).
</li><li> Also done with most of the inmates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreenMile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreenMile">The Green Mile</a></em>; while they probably weren't on the outside, on Death Row most are repentant and sympathetic. One inmate, a black woman, could be argued to be sympathetic both in and out of prison since she killed a two-timing husband. Averted with William Wharton and John Coffey; the former because he was thoroughly unrepentant, the latter because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he didn't kill anyone</span>.
</li><li> John Kelly (later Clark) could be seen as one during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> in <em>Without Remorse</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em>: The murderer in <em>Witness In Death</em> turns out to be this. The victim was a bastard in a number of ways. What pushed her into killing him was the fact that he deliberately had sex with their daughter, crowed about it, and threatened to have a threesome composed of him, her, and their daughter. The murderer's first kill gets full sympathy points. However, her <em>second</em> kill (that of a blackmailer who found out about her first crime) comes off as more cold-blooded and self-serving, and therefore less sympathetic.
</li></ul><ul><li> Peter in <em>Nineteen Minutes</em> in which a bullied teenager has snapped and committed a school shooting, killing most of his bullies and critically wounding another.

A police officer hit her head with a truncheon. A few months later, she started showing symptoms of brain injury. A dizzy spell causes her to fall off her bicycle which leads to a car fatally striking her. She was also pregnant at the time. Seth finds out the identity of the police officer (PC Gill) who hit her and goes to a demonstration to confront him, bringing a knife "just in case." He sees PC Gill treating a young woman roughly, which causes a flashback to his wife's assault. This is the last straw for him and he stabs Gill in the chest.</span> Inspector Alan Banks thinks that what Seth did was understandable because "he had been pushed far beyond breaking point."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BillyBudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BillyBudd">Billy Budd</a></em>, when the title character kills Claggart, Vere says, "Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang!"
</li><li> The main character in Nedra Tyre's "The Gentle Miss Bluebeard," one Mary Anne Beard, made a bit of a hobby out of euthanasia.
</li><li> Janet Philp's book <em>Burke - Now and Then</em> is written from the perspective of William Burke (of the murderous duo Burke and Hare). In the present day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay">his skeleton</a> muses on the wrong decisions he made that led him to be executed and dissected. William Hare is presented as being the mastermind who led the hesitant Burke into a life of crime, then turned Kings' Evidence and walked free while leaving his former partner to hang. Of course, this <em>is</em> Burke's side of the story, but historical accounts do seem to indicate that he was indeed the lesser of the two evils.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShack">The Shack</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">protagonist Mack is haunted by the fact that as a teenager, he murdered his father</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes">Holes</a></em> has Kate Barlow, who kills the sheriff who tried to blackmail a kiss from her in exchange for sparing the life of her boyfriend, whose only crime was kissing a white woman (Kate) while being black. However, she loses most of her sympathy points when she becomes a full-fledged outlaw, robbing and killing men who'd never done a thing to her.
</li><li> The murderer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CityOfDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CityOfDevils">City of Devils</a></em> targets wealthy and powerful monsters who illegally abducted and turned humans into monsters while filming the transformation as a form of monster pornography. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The killer herself was just a young girl when she was taken and turned into a gremlin against her will.</span>

</li><li> In <em>The Point of Rescue</em>, the victim was emotionally abusive towards her victim and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Amy only being five, she didn't understand the gravity of what she was doing when she pushed the lamp into the bath.

It turns out that he stood guard while three gang members raped a young woman, and when they left for a while she killed the boy so that she could get away before the others came back and raped her again. Understandably, Brenda refuses to call her a murderer.

</li></ul></li><li> Done very often on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em>, mostly when the victim is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>:
<ul><li> "Blackout": a woman tries to seduce her 13-year-old grandson, after sexually abusing her son since he was 13. Her daughter (the boy's mother) finds out. Her mother has been emotionally abusing her for years. After berating her daughter for being ugly, the victim threatens that she still has power over her grandson, and the daughter drowns her.
</li><li> "Justice": a serial date rapist avoids punishment in 1982. The younger brother of one of the victims (who witnessed his sister's rape) follows the victims when they confront the rapist. They leave a gun at the scene. The brother picks it up and shoots the rapist. The rapist was so bad the detectives flat-out tell the brother to plead self-defense.
</li><li> "A Perfect Day": Not for the primary case, but it's revealed through the course of the investigation that an abusive husband<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, who was also the doer in the primary case,</span> was murdered by his battered wife's lover. Vera and Jeffries quickly decide there's no reason the lover's indirect but obvious confession needs to be on the record.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> even manages to pull this off when the victim is a saint. Often, the murder is shown to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">Accidental Murder</a> and/or a crime of passion, committed in a moment of extreme emotional upset, leaving the killer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">genuinely horrified by their actions.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em> featured a bunch.
<ul><li> In one episode, the aging actress who committed the murder has six months to live due to a brain tumor that also leads to her forgetting she committed the crime.
</li><li> A rather meta episode featured none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> as the star of an <em>anti-Columbo</em>-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within The Show</a>. At the start, he talks about how his show makes the murderer sympathetic in some episodes. Lo and behold, the Shatner character then becomes a sympathetic murderer (at least, that's what <em>he</em> thought.
</li><li> Heck, this was a slight problem with the series pilot - the murderer got too much screen time and became sympathetic by default. And then Columbo is a complete and utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a>. This was fixed with the second pilot, however. That's because the "pilot" was a stand-alone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> and the murderer was supposed to be the main character. Columbo was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>.
</li><li> Donald Pleasance's killer wine connoisseur from "Any Port In A Storm" was nothing if not this. His murder was a crime of passion, committed because his brother was going to take away his vineyard - the only place where he'd ever felt truly happy.
</li></ul></li><li> Half of the offenders on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> are sympathetic. (It might or might not help that the team solves crimes by trying to get into the head of the perp.)
<ul><li> The episode "True Night" featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> focusing on members of a certain street gang. The killer turned out to be a comic book artist who had a psychotic break (and thus wasn't even aware of what he was doing) after said street gang forced him to watch them rape and murder his pregnant fiancée before brutally stabbing him and leaving him for dead. To top it off, he's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankieMuniz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankieMuniz">Frankie Muniz</a>. Even the team felt sorry for him.
</li><li> Poor, poor Tobias Hankel. Brutally abused from a young age by his violent, fundamentalist father, spent years taking Dilaudid as an attempt to escape from his awful life, and ended up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dissociative Identity Disorder, with one of his personalities being that of his deceased father</span>. But what makes him <em>really</em> sympathetic is the fact that, during the time he was holding Reid hostage, whenever he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> adopted the personality of his father</span> and hurt Reid, he would afterwards do his best to clean him up and try to stop his pain.
</li><li> In one episode, there are seemingly random killings, and the team believes it to be a homeless person. It turns out to be a former soldier with severe PTSD, who still believes he is in combat and feels terribly guilty about killing a young man from the other side. In the end, he's gunned down for apparently trying to kill a young boy, but with his dying breath, asked if the boy was safe.
</li><li> One episode involved a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> with OCD who, as a boy, watched his father kill his mother, went on to commit similar crimes, and bonded with a blind boy. It didn't help that said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> was absolutely adorable. Because of the blind boy (whose mother he'd killed), he saw what he'd become and hated it. At least that's what the end of the episode implied. He'd left a note at the murder which read "Please stop me" even prior to this as well. Clearly, he wasn't doing this out of desire, but from a psychological compulsion.
</li><li> The killer from "Haunted", a previously non-violent man who had a psychotic break as a result of newly-unlocked memories of childhood trauma that he simply couldn't cope with.
</li><li> Megan Kane, the high-class escort who killed some of her obscenely-rich clients who refused to pay one red cent in child support.
</li><li> The woman in New Orleans who was raped and then got no justice for it, before she became a killer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> loves this trope. A few notable ones:
<ul><li> "You've Got Male": An ex-con visits a woman he met via email while in prison, her sister shows up and taunts her over this, the two of them get into a fight, and the sister accidentally kills her. The sister then tells the convict that she'll blame him; thinking that no one would believe him, he kills her out of desperation to avoid going back to jail.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Killer</strong>: Who'd believe a guy like me?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Grissom</strong>: A guy like me.
</div><ul><li> An aversion from <em>CSI</em> appears in the episode "Killer". The episode shows the murderer, a bank robber who kills the former drug addict who ratted him out. He is portrayed somewhat sympathetically (it's noted that he never harmed anyone during a robbery and at the end of the episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he even turns himself in so his wife doesn't lose custody of their daughter</span>). However, at the very end, he ruefully asks Grissom "So where did I screw up?" Grissom then bluntly tells him, "You killed two people." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Notably</a>, he wouldn't have been caught if he hadn't committed the second murder.
</li><li> A teenage girl accidentally kills her younger brother when he catches their uncle forcing himself on her (which results in a child) and threatens to tell their mom; as the unfavourite, she knows her mom would sooner believe she'd forced herself on her uncle than the other way around. Her mother later kills her husband who loudly tries to take the blame for killing her son. She even acknowledges that all this could have been avoided if she'd been a better mother so her daughter could feel like she could trust her.
</li><li> An elderly soldier who lives in a care home in "Snakes" kills a telemarketer who had been taking advantage of an elderly neighbour of his with Alzheimer's by calling her repeatedly and selling her stuff, knowing she had forgotten the last call.
</li><li> A 'recovering' addict in "Road To Recovery" is found dead in a rehab clinic. The killer is found to be a recovering addict who is taking his treatment seriously for the sake of being allowed to see his children again. The victim had a rich husband and little to lose if she failed the course and enjoyed goading others into giving into their vices. She put a gift-wrapped bottle of bourbon into the guy's room and kept pushing him to drink it until he snapped and killed her by accident. To really push it even after all that, the guy still never drank a drop and broke down crying in the station when he realised he'd never see his sons again.
</li><li> In the "Fare Game" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>, a chef is discovered to be the murderer of a millionaire who got her millions through multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuits</a>, of which he was one of the victims. After finally dragging himself out of bankruptcy, divorce, and a ruined life to try again working at a new restaurant and under a new name, she showed up at his new place with the intent of pulling the exact same scheme on his new boss, and he snapped, tracked her down, and killed her by letting her choke on one of the octopi served at the restaurant in an echo of the stunt she'd originally pulled as an excuse to sue him. The guy from the B-plot of the above was also sympathetic. He was the participant in a water gun game where players were encouraged to creatively trick targets into letting down their guard to be 'assassinated'. The victim tricked his soon-to-be killer, a desperate actor trying to provide for his family into thinking he got a part only to 'kill' him. The killer decided to get back at him by taking a blank gun and firing it into him from point-blank range, sadly that was so close that even the blanks would be lethal and it killed him.
</li><li> From the same series, there's the perp from "Prey": the victim was a stalker who had already caused one of his victims to commit suicide. The perp was another victim whom the law did very little to protect (a few restraining orders, the violations of which only got the stalker a few days in jail) and had even changed her name and moved to another city to escape, only for him to follow her. Feeling that she had no option other than killing herself or be killed, she finally killed him. The team feels pretty sympathetic towards her (even Mac, who. in an earlier episode. has shown disgust to a rape victim who killed rapists acquitted on technicalities) and Hawkes even reassures her that since she only left circumstantial evidence (the woman audited a class that Stella taught), it will be very hard for her to be convicted.
</li><li> The cheerleader who poisoned a man with atropine during a basketball game. Why? Because, during another game sometime before, he had mocked her for being overweight, which led her to a completely undeserved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a> (including a sudden break-up). The girl managed to lose weight and carry out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> to get her revenge.
</li><li> The epitome, though, is the one guy who is responsible, by complete and total accident, for the death of his grandmother, wife, and next-door neighbor, and winds up buried up to his waist in cement for it.
</li><li> And another in a different episode, who, because of false advertising and criminal negligence on the part of joke store owner Laughing Larry, had a childhood friend die in front of him when they were ten years old. He promptly stopped reading any comic books or playing with any toys, and when he got married, later, refused to let his son do either of those or play outside. When his wife divorced and placed him with a restraining order, he understood he was in the wrong, and blamed Laughing Larry for making him that way, deciding to kill him with a lethal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveCigar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveCigar">Explosive Cigar</a>. Unfortunately, Laughing Larry gave the cigar to an innocent man. The killer felt deeply guilty and even tried to stop the man before it blew up and killed him, and was willing to pay for his crime, so long as he knew that Laughing Larry would never laugh again.
</li><li> And another at the end of a fourth season episode had a police commissioner shoot an unarmed inmate inside the interrogation room because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the inmate was a 30+-year-old convicted sexual predator who, along with another predator, forged fake birth certificates to take advantage of the first one's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">teenage-looking appearance</a> to enroll in high school and lure teenage girls to their shared home, get them drunk, and rape them together. The only known victim (as in, many others exist but they haven't been shown) was the police commissioner's young daughter, who was humiliated and traumatized by the ordeal and only came forward when she was seen on footage after talking to a guidance counselor about the ordeal just before he's murdered</span>. From everyone's reaction, combined with the commissioner's face afterwards, they know he's going to jail for it, but it damn sure is worth it.
</li><li> Subverted in "Coming of Rage" where the killer describes her plan to make herself into one of these for her trial, despite planning the cold-blooded murder of the victim. Sarah doesn't buy it. Of course, in CSI, you know you can't be sympathetic if Sarah doesn't sympathize with you...
</li><li> In "Blood Drops," an entire family is murdered except for the two daughters, one a teenager, the other much younger. Turns out the murder was arranged by the older girl - her father had been sexually abusing her for years, and the younger girl was actually her own daughter, the product of the abuse. When their father began turning his attention on the younger girl, it was the last straw, and she convinced a couple of her male classmates to kill not only him but also her mother and her brothers (for knowing about the abuse and not doing anything to protect her).
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">jolly fat guy</a> who was sick and tired of constantly having his mailbox smashed by drunken teenagers driving by. In revenge, he filled his mailbox with cement, and unfortunately, one of the teenagers' arms broke, their car swerved, and they ran into a tree, killing them. The man is still arrested for murder because he concealed evidence by burying the fatal mailbox in his yard. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1387n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1387n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1387n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Artistic License  Law</a> as felony murder is huge stretch for any prosecutor trying to convict him, and even if they tried that, defacing a mailbox is Federal Crime and they would have no jurisdictio. And the burden of proof for reckless endangerment means they would have to convince a jury that it would be common sense that the kids would all die because of the concrete. At best they could nail him for destruction of evidence, which would still make it a federal crime, or his defense lawyer could easily argue that the Nevada courts don't have jurisdiction because it was Federal Property. Long story short, he was arrested for plot reasons. </span>
<p></p></li><li> Another one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em>, a mother was killed at her home. At first, as usual, the first suspect is her husband, and later, her daughter's boyfriend, who got some glass fragments on his shoes traced to a broken lamp in the house. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they found a video which was recorded over an old recording, and the old recording showed that, indeed, the 'monster' in the house was actually the mother, not the father. She was killed by her young son, and her eldest daughter, who just seen him do it, followed suit and beat her up with a bat a few more times in the head.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> occasionally has these.

Considering what Archie Mitchell was, one can be forgiven for saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">he deserved it</a>. Especially after he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">raped Stacey while she was still suffering from bipolar disorder</a></em>.

She seems to be the only woman he ever loved, and almost got him executed for a murder he didn't commit.

The victim was counting on the guy being too old and feeble to do anything about it. The man's son and lawyer try to get him declared unfit to stand trial by way of dementia so he wouldn't be sent to prison, but he rightfully insists that he's totally competent and maintains that by killing the con-artist, he regained his entire livelihood and identity that was stolen from him.
</li><li> When a man who spent fifteen years in prison for beating his wife until she could barely move, killing his young daughter, and chaining his infant son to the radiator to let him starve with no remorse is found run over with a severed leg, nobody feels any sort of pity for him and both the detectives and the police chief (from both homicide and SVU) hope he dies painfully. His prison social worker is arrested for the crime, but not before the chief earnestly pleads with her to tell her what happened so the DA can get her the best possible deal, even telling her that she wishes she could throw her a parade instead of charging her with anything. At trial, it's discovered that, after she found out that the man had a new fiancee with children he spent time with, which violated his parole, the social worker tried to tell his parole officer, but he never "got around to" calling her back. They play a recorded therapy session where he only expresses happiness that he's getting out and that he'll be able to spend time with his fiancee's children, smugly saying that he's always been a good dad, to which the social worker can barely hide her revulsion. Finally, when she found out that the fiancee's young daughter sustained a broken wrist, she snapped and ran him over. Even Jack, who's known for being extremely hard-lined and often without sympathy for whoever he's prosecuting, no matter the circumstances, says that he would be happy to make a deal with her if she would admit that she ran him over. The jury comes back with a "not guilty" verdict in what Serena says is record time.

It's even speculated that, had she divorced him, he'd still have to pay alimony and child support without having any parental rights whatsoever, despite not loving his son any less because of the reveal.
</li><li> A CIA analyst who needed to get a list of Cuban double-agents to the Cuban Resistance Movement enlists the help of her longtime friend by paying for her breast implants and inserting the microchip into one of them. Unfortunately for her, the friend was not patriotically-inclined, since she was now part of a drug ring, and tried to blackmail the analyst for more money (which she didn't have.) She was forced to retrieve the implant (yes, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">that</a> </em> manner) or risk her friend possibly selling it and getting everyone on the list killed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She gets away since the agent behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> to frame her drug contacts for the murder covers the whole thing up</span>.
</li><li> In "Coerced", a schizophrenic man kidnapps a child, kills one man, and injures another, but it all comes back to the fact that he genuinely believes the kid is his son and that the other people were trying to take the kid away to hurt him. What's more, he had at one point achieved a stabilized mental condition through medication, but the group home he had been living in had cut him off his medication and kicked him out because he had seen them kill another resident through negligence and then stage her death as a suicide, and they wanted to ensure that he wouldn't be believed if he tried to report it. In the end, the schizophrenic man is sent to a treatment facility rather than prison, and the group home staff are charged with the crimes he committed as a result of their actions.
</li><li> A woman and her mother both conspired to kill an old man, because the man had kidnapped her, and several other women, and forced them to be his bride in his own hidden dungeon.
</li><li> In "Anchor", a defendant is being tried for murdering "anchor babies" (children who are born on American soil, thus becoming legal American citizens, even though their parents are illegally in the U.S.) and he and his defense attorney argue that he was indoctrinated by the anti-immigration rantings of a Rush Limbaugh-esque political pundit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When said pundit takes the stand and creates chaos in the courtroom with his testimony, the defendant is acquitted. Before leaving the courtroom, the defendant whispers something in his lawyer's ear. The defendant's face changes to a smug smirk and the lawyer's is akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> The next scene has Fin bemoaning the loss of the case at a bar when he gets a call from the attorney. When Fin comes to the office, the lawyer says that the defendant revealed to him that he murdered on his own accord instead of the political commentator's and he planned to kill more first-generation Americans. Fin tells him they need to stop the killer, but the camera shows there's no need. It cuts to the defendant lying dead on the floor of the lawyer's office in a pool of blood. The last shot shows the lawyer slowly surrendering his gun to Fin. While the lawyer's actions were technically illegal and would surely result in disbarment and life in prison, you can't help but sympathize with him for killing a bigoted sociopath if it meant saving the lives of several innocent children.</span>
</li><li> One man goes on a brutal killing spree because he believes that God wants him to. He acts seriously unhinged at his indictment and while in custody, and it's revealed why: he has advanced syphilis that turned his brain into Swiss cheese. The truly sympathetic part is that he had tested positive for syphilis during a life insurance physical some years earlier, but the insurance company <em>never told him about the positive test result</em>. If they had, he could've been treated, and the ensuing chaos would've never happened.
</li><li> In "Confidential," an investment banker who had gotten away with murder two decades earlier and is on the verge of doing it again is gunned down in the precinct by a man he defrauded years ago. The final scene of the episode reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man's lawyer was the one who told the murderer where to find him. She knew that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">he'd raped and murdered two women</a> and ruined an innocent man's life to cover his tracks, and she knew he'd never stop and there was nothing she could do within the legal system because of privilege rules (anything she revealed would have been thrown out as evidence), so she found another way to make sure he'd never be able to hurt anyone else. When the detectives figure it out, they pretty much imply that they're not even going to try and work around the fact that she set the plot up in such a way that there's no real way that you could prove she was behind it.</span>

Despite the brutality of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her</span> crimes, one can't help but sympathize with the motive.
</li><li> The killer in "Sacrifice" becomes a lot more sympathetic when we learn his motive: the victim was developing a program that would have allocated educational resources based on a mathematical assessment of "potential", and the killer, who came from a poor neighborhood, knew that such a program would have denied him the opportunities that allowed him to escape and that other people like him would be denied pretty much any opportunity if the program were ever implemented.

He also tried to kill his stepmother for failing to try and protect him but turned the gun on himself when Dean stood in front of her. Sam was sympathetic to Max; Dean was not.

His guilt in the case was completely undeniable, but the legal team wants him to get off anyway because they decided he was enough of this and not a harm to anyone else.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">James, the protagonist, who killed his wife</span>. In an unusual variant, both the murderer <em>and</em> the victim are very sympathetic, although it's left somewhat ambiguous as to how sympathetic the murderer's motivations actually are. There is also Angela, who killed her physically and sexually abusive father and brother (the latter's murder is only mentioned in the game's Japan-only novelization). Then there's Eddie, whose first murder was a sympathetic one but he became obsessed with killing after some psychological tormenting.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4">Silent Hill 4</a></em>, we get an interesting example with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Walter Sullivan</span>. Most if not all of the people he killed caused him some grievance before, but he doesn't hate them, it's just that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by killing them, he'll appease his goddess and be reunited with his mother</span>.
</li><li> Depending on the ending, Murphy becomes this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em>. If it turns out that he did <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murder Frank Coleridge,</span> then he finally acknowledges his guilt, sincerely apologizing for it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even Frank's daughter forgives him.</span> He's also something of a sympathetic <em>attempted</em> murderer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for beating the ever-loving shit out of the guy who molested and murdered his son</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Origami Killer, aka Scott Shelby</span>, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em> is revealed to be this by the game's end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em>, mostly. Subverted when "The Boss" pulls off a few kills that are patently unjustifiable, reflecting how he/she has become a power-hungry cutthroat rather than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> gangster. Even unrepentant mass murderer Johnny Gat looks nice in comparison.
<ul><li> Although, in the Boss's defense, most of those murders were either self-defense or revenge, with the exception of those caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, the people s/he killed deserved it. However, by the end, s/he is still a <em>very</em> bad person. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, while s/he struck first against Maero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">by disfiguring his face for insulting him/her</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">what Maero did</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">to Carlos</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">as revenge</a> made the murders of Jessica (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">taunted him/her about it</a>), Matt (though Matt also tried to strangle him/her), and, finally, Maero quite understandable.</span> As for the similar incident with the Ronin, it's easy to say that this was <em>before</em> the Boss became such a bastard.
<ul><li> Ironically, in that story arc, The Boss's cruelest moment was when s/he didn't kill someone. It was when s/he pointlessly burned and crippled Matt's hand with fireworks for no other reason than to send a message to Maero, since he was Maero's best friend (he only did tattoos for the gang, nothing more).
</li></ul></li><li> Johnny is especially easy to sympathize with during the cemetery burial of a crime rival who was practically begging for it.
</li></ul></li><li> Not all of the Splicers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> are mindless psychopaths. It's hard to feel any pity for Toasty (a filthy lecher) or Ladysmith (a racist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>). But then there's Pigskin, a teenage football player pushed into hunting you down on the threat of death at the hands of the other Splicers, who calls for his parents when he's not trying to kill you. Or Rosebud, who's trapped in the memory of the day Ryan's men took her daughter from her, and often hallucinates that <em>you're</em> the man who did it. You still have to kill them in self-defense, but it's hard not to feel bad about it.
<ul><li> And by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">the sequel</a>, research into used ADAM proves that the stem cells are semi-sentient, absorbing the minds of their original users and injecting them into unsuspecting new users. So it turns out that about ten of the "core minds" were able to overpower the remaining Rapture population and have destroyed any semblance of their original memories and personalities. You've been killing people who don't even remember who they are.
</li></ul></li><li> Peri from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> is a good example. When she was a child, she saw her mother murdered in front of her by one of the servants. The servant was punished, but Peri thought all servants were the same, so she'd kill all the servants whenever she was upset, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">many of the servants having family themselves</a>. She never understood that killing was wrong, as her father (who watched her do this) never said it was, and killing then became second nature to her. It takes some support conversations for her to resolve to improve.

However, she's also been brainwashed, suffered extensive neural reconditioning, and went through biological alternation by terrorist group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization">Talon</a> to make her into the inhuman killer she is today. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil">It becomes especially tragic</a> when you learn that she used to be a perfectly sweet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> before she was kidnapped, went through said reconditioning, and was then forced to <em>kill her own husband</em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, a questline will have the player encounter Sindig, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolf</a> imprisoned in the Falkreath jail for murdering a local child. Sindig explains that he is trying to control his transformations, and stole the Ring of Hircine, the artifact of the Daedric Prince Hircine, who is the Lord of the Hunt and creator of lycanthropes, for the Ring was said to be able to let someone control their transformations. Unfortunately, this angered Hircine and he cursed the Ring to make Sindig's transformations worse. The player can take the Ring, and thus themselves be subjected to uncontrolled transformations, but then Hircine will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">demand that they hunt down and kill Sindig for his sport</a>. The player can do so, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHunterBecomesTheHunted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHunterBecomesTheHunted">rescue Sindig from Hircine's other hunters</a>, and either way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Hircine will be pleased and lift the curse</a>, as both hunting down the prey or the prey turning on the hunter are expressions of his sphere.
</li><li> While Yandere-chan herself is <em>not</em> an example of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em>, there can be plenty of other cases:
<ul><li> For example, a student kidnapped and brainwashed enough to murder anyone Yandere-chan points them at. Usually right after they end up killing themselves because they snap out of it long enough to realize what they've done.
</li><li> Someone who's been bullied enough might also snap and kill the person they believe to be behind the bullying. While it'd be pretty satisfying if it's the person that actually is behind the bullying, Yandere-chan can also manipulate her into attacking someone innocent instead, making the situation even more tragic.
</li><li> A video proposed that a future elimination method might also be driving the rival to murder, and showed as an example Kokona being manipulated by Yandere-chan into kidnapping Musume, then Kokona snapping and taking a baseball bat to Musume's head after Musume had the nerve to laugh at Kokona for having to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatedDating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatedDating">Compensated Dating</a> to help her father pay off his debt (held by <em>Musume's</em> father, just to twist the knife further). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kokona is arrested for murder, but despite all her pleas the police are unwilling to investigate Yandere-chan's role because she has a solid alibi.</span>
</li><li> When discussing the sanity mechanic in another video, it was hinted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Senpai himself might become one of these if he finds out Yandere-chan killed his childhood friend and/or younger sister.</span>

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> games have some of these.
<ul><li> In the first game, Case 4 killer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yanni Yogi, who killed the man who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">ruined his life fifteen years ago by convincing him to plead insanity</a></span>.
</li><li> <em>Justice for All</em>:
<ul><li> The killer of the third case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Acro, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelchairWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelchairWoobie">paraplegic</a> who wanted to get back at Regina for accidentally crippling him and putting his brother into a deep coma, but ended up killing her father (and his father-figure) Mr. Berry by accident. At the end of the trial, he even breaks down crying</span>.
</li><li> The culprit of the second case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mimi Miney, was overworked by her boss at a clinic where she worked as a nurse, which resulted in her accidentally killing 14 patients and getting in a car crash which killed her sister and burnt her face off. She thought the only thing to do was to start a new life as her sister Ini Miney (a college student). She handed over a picture of her sister for her face reconstruction surgery and became her sister. However, her boss wasn't doing so well with the impact she had left, so he tried to search her down to prove that the whole thing was her fault through a spirit medium (talks to the deceased). Her only options were to come out from hiding or erase her boss. Guess which one she chose</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third game, Case 5 killer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Godot only murdered Misty Fey (possessed by the spirit of Dahlia) to protect the little sister of the woman he'd loved. Afterwards, he continually directed the trial to make sure Phoenix eventually found him guilty. It's also implied that Misty went into the situation willing to die for her daughter</span>.
</li><li> <em>Investigations 2</em> has, of all things, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></em> turning out to be one of these. Here's a brief rundown: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As a kid, his father only valued him as a taste tester for his cooking. His father's colleague had him kidnapped to blackmail the father, and the colleague's son (the murderer's best friend) helped. They both ended up locked in a car on a snowy night and would have frozen to death were it not for a certain assassin saving them. His father then fled the country after committing a murder, not caring whatsoever that he was abandoning his son. He ended up at what was apparently an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a>, where he one day witnessed the orphanage's owner, the chief prosecutor and body double of the President of Zheng Fa kidnap the real President, demand millions of dollars in ransom, <em>then have him assassinated anyway</em>, and overheard them planning to kill the assassin too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">All three of them got away with it.</a> Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaddenIntoMisanthropy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaddenIntoMisanthropy">this destroyed his faith in pretty much everything.</a> He conducted an elaborate plan to bring all three to justice, killing the body double himself while getting the others arrested. After all that, can you really blame him for what he became</span>?
</li><li> Zig-zagged in Case 3 of <em>Investigations 2</em>, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dane Gustavia. He killed Isaac Dover because he was going to blackmail him with the fact that he was taking pictures of the Angel's recipe, a secret that would ruin his reputation as a pastry chef. However, it's also shown that he is a literal psychopath and has no qualms about letting Jeff Masters taking the blame and completely abandoning his own child to achieve his goal to become the world's best pastry chef</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marlon Rimes</span>, the culprit of the DLC case in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, similar to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Acro from the second game. Even though he didn't really kill anyone (the victim fell back-first into a drained pool and Rimes tried to save him), he tried to kill the whale he thought was responsible for his girlfriend's death. Turns out, not only was it a different whale, but his girlfriend died because of a heart condition. Also, like Acro, he breaks down and demands a guilty verdict for him, if it means Sasha, the woman who reminds him of his girlfriend goes free. Because he really didn't kill anyone and had the Judge's sympathies, he was released not too long after and remains the only culprit who was never really guilty of anything</span>.
</li><li> <em>Spirit of Justice</em> has a few.
<ul><li> The culprit of Case 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beh'leeb Inmee, who accidentally killed Rheel Neh'mu (whom she regarded as a son) in self-defense because he tried to kill her and her husband, the abbot, as well as her yet unborn child, for being rebels. Because the only one who was really vying for her incarceration or execution was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, she is set free</span>.
</li><li> The killer of Case 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geiru Toneido</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jealousy aside, like Rimes, Beh'leeb, and Acro above she was one of the few killers to actually regret what they've done. She was snubbed by her master unable to follow in her daddy's footsteps because Teifu wanted her to find her own calling in life away from rakugo. She hates her current job, and genuinely feels bad for what she's done. She even cries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfRemorse">Tears of Remorse</a>.</span>

The manga mitigates this by implying that Leon wasn't trying to kill Sayaka Maizono, but calm her down, then he ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">killing her by accident</a></span>.
</li><li> Chapter 2: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mondo Owada did it by a loss of self-control after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> was unintentionally triggered by Chihiro Fujisaki, not out of premeditated malice, and he immediately <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIGone">regretted it afterward</a>.

</li><li> Chapter 3: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A very odd example with Celestia Ludenburg, as she orchestrated the deaths of two people, with the help of an accomplice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">just to win Monokuma's ten million dollars</a> so she could live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyCastle">Big Fancy Castle</a> and be waited on hand and foot by millions of men in dressed as vampires. Everyone else is disgusted that she'd orchestrate murders for a petty reason like that.

That being said, for all her pettiness, she didn't even try to curse those who condemn her, which would've been in-line with the pettiness she presents. So, it's kinda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> in the end, especially once it's revealed that she wouldn't have done what she did if her memories hadn't been tampered with.

To elaborate:
<ul><li> The Chapter 1 killer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teruteru Hanamura</span>, found out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter">Nagito</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">Komaeda</a> was planning to kill someone to start the murder game and, rightly realizing how dangerous he was, Teruteru decided to kill <em>him</em> first to stop that from happening. However, the Ultimate Imposter, a.k.a. "Byakuya Togami", pushed Nagito out of the way so that Teruteru accidentally killed the Imposter instead. Adding to Teruteru's sympathy is that he had the additional motive of wanting to return home and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBoy">find out if his sick mother was okay</a>, since the students had learned from Monokuma that they'd lost two years' worth of memories of their time at Hope's Peak</span>.
</li><li> Chapter 2's culprit, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peko Pekoyama</span>, was revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the hired killer/bodyguard of fellow student Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu. Having been raised by his family since infancy to view herself as nothing but Fuyuhiko's tool, when he was about to kill Mahiru Koizumi (due to her involvement in covering up the death of his sister), Peko stepped in and killed her instead, believing this is what Fuyuhiko would want her to do. Then, after the original scapegoat for the murder was proven innocent, she deliberately sets <em>herself</em> up to be voted as the guilty party, because in her mind, that's the <em>wrong choice</em>. Since she's nothing but a tool with no free will of her own, she is therefore not the murderer but the murder <em>weapon</em>, and Fuyuhiko is the true culprit. The outcome of the trial is essentially left up to Fuyuhiko's decision: Does he take credit as the killer and be allowed to escape while everyone else is killed for voting wrong (which he had been boasting about willing to do since the very beginning), or does he say Peko is the killer and sacrifice only her while remaining stuck on the island with everyone else? Fuyuhiko takes the latter option, tearfully confessing to Peko that he never saw her as a tool and never <em>wanted</em> her as a tool, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">he just wanted her</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Monokuma then declares Peko the killer and has her executed</a> (and implies that he would have done so anyway regardless of Fuyuhiko's decision). Fuyuhiko tries to save her during her execution, only for Monokuma to trick her into accidentally injuring him instead</span>.
</li><li> The murderer of Chapter 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikan Tsumiki</span>, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the least sympathetic culprit of the game excluding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, having remorselessly killed Hiyoko Saionji and Ibuki Mioda in a bid to show her love to "her beloved" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Junko Enoshima</a>), due to her strain of the Despair Disease (chapter 3's motive) reverting her back to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> Ultimate Despair state</span>. Still, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like Celeste, she has <em>some</em> sympathetic traits, like the fact that she had been viciously bullied all her life (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">including by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">one of her victims, Hiyoko</a>) and implied that the other students standing by and not stopping this was part of the reason she turned out like she did</span>, the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it was only because of the disease she picked up while caring for other sick people that drove her to this plus the fact that it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptor">Junko</a></em> who is her "beloved"</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's also more sympathetic in hindsight</span> when we learn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">none of the students became Ultimate Despair willingly and were instead brainwashed into it (though this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDislikedExplanation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDislikedExplanation">Fan-Disliked Explanation</a>)</span>.
</li><li> The culprit of Chapter 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gundham Tanaka</span>, is heavily implied to have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">made a mutual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> together with his victim, Nekomaru Nidai, to save the entire class from starving to death when they were locked in a funhouse with no food until a murder occurred. Gundham and Nekomaru both willingly engaged in a fight to the death despite knowing that whoever won would be executed anyway once they were caught, and though Gundham did try to conceal his involvement (since his philosophy of never giving up on life meant that he couldn't just roll over and do nothing), once he was found out, he confessed easily and gave the other students a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> urging them to always keep fighting to live. He's sympathetic enough that, as he lay dying after his execution, the spirits of his past pets carried him off to heaven</span>.
</li><li> In Chapter 5, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">so-called</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">"killer"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">"traitor"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Chiaki Nanami</a>, is the most sympathetic culprit in the whole game, possibly even the whole <em>series</em>, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">"victim"</a>, Nagito Komaeda, was the true culprit. Having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">found out that the entire class including himself were formerly members of Ultimate Despair</a>, except for the traitor (whose identity he did not know), he decided that only the traitor deserved to live, and so planned his own death as an assisted suicide while relying on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Ultimate Luck</a> to make it so that the traitor would deal him the final blow, not only accidentally, but <em>unknowingly</em>, in order to create a murder that the other students couldn't solve. Either they would rule it as a straight suicide and vote for him as the culprit, or realize that one of them unknowingly killed him but not know who and be forced to guess, most likely guessing wrong. Chiaki, however, figured this out, realized that she was the one who accidentally killed him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed herself to save the others</a>. Then Monokuma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">kills both her and her friend Monomi, who killed nobody, just to twist the knife in</a>. This trope is so much the case for her that it's easy to argue that Nagito was the true murderer and Chiaki was the true victim</span>. And then its revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>this isnt even the first time shes died</em></span>.

Once it becomes clear that her victim was <em>not</em> the mastermind, she actually encourages Shuichi Saihara to out her as the killer during the trial.
