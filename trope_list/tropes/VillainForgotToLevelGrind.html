He's literally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">just as strong as before</a></em>. Not any stronger at all.
</p><p>It seems that there was an intelligence failure on the villain's part and he's failed to consult the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a> before attacking. As a result, the heroes have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">increased in power</a> while the villain has stayed still. He was extremely dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">the last time</a>, but the heroes have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> and improving their skills so much that they now have him outclassed. Which asks the question, why didn't the villain use the time to improve and keep his lead over the good guys?
</p><p>As a video game trope, an example would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">Final Boss Preview</a> kicking your party's ass when you're level 10, but when you come back at level 50 he's a pushover. It can even occur in some games where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">enemies level up as you do</a>, as long as there is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">ceiling</a></em> on how powerful they can get. This trope just means that after a certain point in time, you eventually outlevel the villains and curb-stomp them as a result.

If the bad guy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardian">Threshold Guardian</a> the whole point could be that they're offering a set challenge to allow people who meet it to pass. Similarly, it may simply be that the heroes, while initially weak, have training resources (like a uniquely talented martial arts instructor) that the villains don't.
</p><p>Otherwise if enough years pass between battles, you could say that the heroes are young and untested while the villain is in their prime in the first encounter, and by the second encounter the heroes are in their prime and the villains, despite having the same bravado, starting to slow down in their old age.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> series gives us a few examples of this. Notably, some early bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Symphony of the Night</a></em>, such as Slogra, Gaibon, Werewolf, and Minotaur, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">are encountered later in the game, but with the same stats as before, and are considered normal, respawning enemies.</a> Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">with your stronger weapons and abilities</a>, they are not nearly as difficult. Even when you're fighting as many as four of them in the same room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a> 3</em> has a more plot-oriented example. Vergil goes from handing Dante his ass during their first encounter, to fighting him to a stand-still in their second, and finally losing to him in their third. However, it's not so much that Vergil forgot to level grind, since he actually gets progressively stronger just like Dante, gaining new weapons (Beowulf, Force Edge) and attacks, but Dante's just gaining much faster than he is. History repeats itself, chronologically speaking, in the original game: Nelo Angelo proves himself Dante's superior in their first battle, but Dante wins their second before slaying him in their third. Thematically appropriate, as Nelo is Vergil's reanimated corpse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> has this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss">Recurring Bosses</a>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em>, a completely unaltered version of the Level 1 boss (Aquamentus) returns guarding Level 7. With the best sword in the game — which is obtainable by that point — it can be killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">in one hit</a>, and the Magical Shield can block its beams.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>: The rematches against the Light World bosses in Ganon's Tower are really easy because by this point you can have the Master Sword and the Silver Arrows.
</li><li> Moldarach in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em>, which reappears later... after your sword has been upgraded to do double damage, making the boss much easier to kill.
</li><li> The rematches with Gohma and Kalle Demos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> are significantly easier, as while you're stripped of any items you didn't have when you fought them, you do get to keep the fully-powered Master Sword, plus any and all life upgrades you've collected along the way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> The SA-X in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>. Justified because it possesses the thing that can completely screw you (the Ice Beam) if you ever cross paths. Only after you get the Varia Suit (to block the freezing) and the Plasma Beam (to pierce the armor and hit the softer X core) does it lose its edge against you and Samus become able to beat it.
</li><li> Berserker Lord is the first boss fought in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> and, while by no means difficult, takes some time to defeat it's one of the two (the other being Meta Ridley) Samus has to confront before acquiring the Hypermode powerup, It returns later in Elysia, and as soon as its weak point is exposed it can be killed near-instantly now that Hypermode <em>is</em> available (as the monster hasn't received any sort of upgrade or improvement).
</li></ul></li><li> The first round of bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> are a real challenge, particularly the Wall of Flesh. Once you reach hard mode and acquire its dramatically more powerful gear, they'll come off like pushovers. For comparison, the final normal boss has 8000 hit points. The most fragile hard mode boss has 28000 as of 1.2.4.1<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0yazr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0yazr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0yazr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unless you count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">The Twins</a> separately, as one has 23000 and the other one has 20000.</span>

No matter what you do, he cannot be damaged. Of course, as you go along the game and subsequently encounter him again, he will be damageable by a few weapons you acquire from the boss Mavericks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a></em>: Aeolus and Siarnaq intercept Biomatch Model A at the Tower of Verdure with the intent to claim Model W; even though both of them are together, Aeolus decides to let you off the hook, confident that he can "end you at any time". How wrong he is when you fight him proper. The last time you see them before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, however, all four Guardian Biomatches show up in the same room with singular intent to shut you down.

In their first appearance close to the first shopping center, as a duo they're fairly strong, about on par with Moose, the first required boss (who lies in wait a few screens further ahead). Beat them at their original hangout, though, and they'll reappear later in the game next to the sauna, one screen away from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">River City High</a>, with the exact same stats as their first appearance.

Instead of having the fights based off of your level, your level is restricted in several missions as well as optional "BCNM" fights.

The result could be a final boss that is much easier to defeat than the first two bosses.
</li><li> Subverted in "While Guthix Sleeps" and "Ritual of the Mahjarrat" quests. Despite being only Level 14 in the Temple of Ikov quest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lucien</a> becomes immensely powerful and obtains two god-weapons.

<ul><li> Bosses tend to this, such that players will occasionally revisit particularly frustrating dungeons 20 or 30 levels later for the pleasure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomping</a> the boss that gave them so much trouble the time before, sometimes even <em>single-handedly</em>. Aversions to this are Heroic dungeons, where two versions exist, one for top level characters. Also the sorcerer Arugal, who appears as the boss of a 20th level dungeon, then is resurrected as a 70th level elite. Arugal's former residence Shadowfang Keep, while he's no longer present, also gets a heroic mode. This leads to a 65 level difference between the normal and Heroic mode. The similarly-leveled Dead Mines also get an 85th level version. Seeing as it's supposed to be a direct threat to Stormwind itself, this is appropriate.
</li><li> Averted by bosses that appear again in a higher level dungeon, especially if they're moving from 5-man dungeon to raid. Anu'barak, Thorim, and all three Blood Princes multiply their hit points several times over by the time they show up as bosses.
</li><li> The Naxxramas bosses go from Level 60 to Level 80 in <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> (an expansion pack that focuses on the battle against the Scourge, which includes the residents of the dungeon), but in the 10-man versions, some of them have fewer hit points than their original 40-man counterparts. Ragnaros returned in <em>Cataclysm</em> at Level 85.
</li><li> Kael'thas actually <em>devolved</em> a few levels, between his appearance in the endgame raid Tempest Keep and his coda as the end boss of five-man Magister's Terrance. Given that he was severely injured in Tempest Keep, and still has a <em>giant chunk of crystal</em> embedded in his chest, it's understandable.
</li><li> The Apothecary trio from the "Love is in the Air" event did grow stronger with each expansion, but not proportional to the player characters. As of <em>Battle for Azeroth</em>, what was initially a tricky boss fight that required strict adherence to fight mechanics has become so easy that most party forgo a tank and healer and just burn them down. Notably, what used to be a mad rush to take down the first boss before the third one became active is now instead a waiting period between killing the first two and the third one activating.

Halfway through both games, there's a special level where you essentially fight the final boss with a speed of about 45 (from the previous level's 20.) The thing is, if you keep playing through the game, the final level/boss has the same speed of 45, while the previous level's speed this time is 40.

On one hand, this is justified because the NPC Hunters are created using the same character creation system as your own character, meaning there's an upper cap on how strong they can be, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">a couple of the Hunters</a> <em>are</em> maxed out already on your first playthrough...

</li><li> This also occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, where after running through the game a couple of times, Lavos can be defeated at the very beginning of the game with just Crono and Marle - or even Crono himself.
</li><li> Magus is fought at the grand finale of the 600 AD subplot, and it's a grueling, drawn-out slugfest that takes three party members punching through an elaborate magic barrier. Later on, one of your party members can choose to duel him one-on-one, and his stats are exactly the same, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">he lost his magic barrier and the powerful attacks that made him so hard</a> due to being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">weakened by Lavos.</span> In this case, however, it's less 'forgot to level grind' and more the fact that his plan for defeating the true Big Bad of the game is in ruins and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">doesn't much care whether he lives or dies at this point</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> by Spekkio, who "levels up" with your strongest character, but once you reach level 50, he won't level up again until level 99, which most players only reach <em>for the sole purpose of fighting this boss in his ultimate form</em>. At level 65, you have him completely outclassed. And before level 50, he only actually transforms at every 10th level. If you take advantage of this and fight him one level before he upgrades, he poses little threat.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Avatar of Khaine</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> 2</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">nightmarishly difficult enemy</a>, with abilities that will one-shot most of your squads, three hundred thousand health, and a crazy amount of support requiring Terminator armor, plasma cannons, and thirty to forty minutes of alternately beating on it and running away to defeat, combined with several orbital bombardments. When you run up against another Avatar in the <em>Chaos Rising</em> expansion, however, it's still got three hundred thousand health and the same abilities, despite the fact that your squads are six or eight levels higher, and can be defeated with conventional weapons. In fact, the only reason the Avatar in <em>Chaos Rising</em> isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> is that you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">don't have Terminator armor or Orbital Bombardment</a> at that point in the game.
</li><li> A recurrent feature in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>. In the first game, early hazardous enemies like ogres, spiders and ghouls quickly become mooks, while by the sequel even the once fearsome doppelgangers become cannon fodder. In the second game, things like vampires, mind flayers and beholders are increasingly painful and dangerous (while other monsters like umber hulks are at least annoying and disrupting), but by the time you hit the expansion, you will slice through them like a hot knife in butter.
<ul><li> Vampires are hilarious if you have a cleric. After the tough battles in Shadows of Amn, during Throne of Bhaal you can instakill them just by pressing the "turn undead" button if your cleric has leveled up enough.
</li><li> And speaking of vampires... Bodhi. She's a difficult but doable encounter in chapter 3, but the final battle with her in chapter 6 comes after you gained tons of XP, many powerful magic items and even up to three allied factions joining you in the battle. Her ingame threats and provocations could get almost ridiculous if you have installed the expansion, since you can get to the Watcher's Keep as early as chapter 2 and obtain humongous tons of experience and equipment that players aren't supposed to get until Throne of Bhaal (thus unbalancing player progression and battles). If that's the case, you can almost solo her dungeon with little effort during chapter 3, and get to epic levels with high level abilities during the underdark, meaning that the final confrontation in chapter 6 can be an instakill walking parade (against her minions) and an easy boss shutdown (against her).
</li><li> Dragons can be spectacularly this with a little metagaming: hard and challenging the first time you meet them, but almost always with an option to avoid battle; quickly disposed off if you level up before returning and ultimately engaging them.
</li><li> While indeed a difficult opponent in the first game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarevok</span> can return as a shadow in the sequel for a quick confrontation, at the same level you left him... while you already surpassed him, with stronger gear, while he doesn't even have anymore his former allies assisting him.
</li><li> Averted with Irenicus: he grows stronger every time you face him.
</li><li> Averted too with random guards, but also subverted: while they grow stronger and with better equipment, they do at a slower pace than you. A single guard in Throne of Bhaal can solo the entire Flaming Fist headquarters in the first game, but by that time you can easily kill all the men-at-arms in Saradush or Amkethran, while in the early levels of Baldur's Gate the Fists could be tough opponents for your rookie party.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens a few ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>. While enemies level up in scale with you, many of them don't gain any new abilities, while the party does. Those new abilities are often able to even out or overcome the advantages that some of the tougher early-game enemies have.
<ul><li> The first ogre you meet is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a> that <em>will</em> kill you if you aren't prepared for it. By the endgame, three or four of them together don't pose nearly the threat that the first one did.
</li><li> Also, the Revenant. The first one is, most likely, going to be the toughest one of all. The thing is powerful, tough to kill, and likes to pull ranged attackers to it. Each subsequent one is slightly weaker due to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">Level Grind</a>. While none of them are truly weak, the last one you're likely to encounter will hardly give you any trouble.
</li><li> As far as individual characters go, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Ser Cauthrien</a> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">incredibly difficult encounter</a> that you were meant to lose so that you could ultimately be captured. Fighting her before the Landsmeet, she's a medium difficulty boss that goes down with a minimum of fuss. Note that these can happen pretty close to each other, and in fact she's made physically weaker (and backed up by fewer mooks) in the second encounter.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is inverted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em>, where a hero is the one that forgets to level. The first time the player controls Tolten he is about the same level as the main cast, and holds his own well enough when forced to fight. However, he does not become a regular party member for another disk, by which point the other's have leveled so much that Tolten seems to die to a stiff breeze and is no help at all in the first dozen or so battles. Luckily the leveling system allows him to gain levels quickly to catch up. This may actually have been intentional, as he is suppose to be a sheltered prince who has to learn to be strong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em> has a not-so-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> in the Triumgorate, and each member of the trio gets their own separate boss fight with plenty of hype leading up to it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">(except Goresby-Purrvis)</a>. And then, in the Realm of the Mighty, you have to fight them again...while they've apparently gained exactly <em>zero</em> levels in the meantime. Vaguely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that their pre-battle dialogue implies that they were very recently resurrected, but then again, given the power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> behind them, you'd think they'd be made a lot stronger.
</li><li> Happens as a result of a "feature" that is almost certainly a bug in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>. Unique NPCs don't "level up" with the player, being stuck at the level they were first spawned (unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">''Oblivion''</a> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, where key NPCs would automatically level up to match the player). Two key NPCs, Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius, are spawned at the very beginning of the game. As a result, when you finally face one or the other of them at the end of Civil War questline, they're stuck at their minimum level and are easily dispatched by a mid-to-high level player. After several months, they finally patched this during the first DLC release. The engine now re-calculates the NPC's level each time they get loaded in a new cell.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>, the Light Warriors fight the four Elemental Fiends again. Lich, the weakest of the fiends, is <em>not</em> an example of this - he's learned to cast Nuke. Kary/Marilith, however, is - she was the second of the four Fiends fought, and was first encountered by a party probably in their mid-teens, level wise, whereas in the final dungeon they're likely to the high 20s in level. To a lesser extent this applies to Kraken and Tiamat, but it's unlikely you'll have outlevelled them to the point that they're pushovers - only somewhat and slightly easier, respectively.

Justified with Felix and Jenna in the first game, as the latter is a hostage for the vast majority of it and the former is directly stated by Saturos and Menardi to be kept out of fights during their travels specifically so he would never be able to become strong enough to be able to oppose them.

</li><li> This is the intrinsic problem with Gym Leaders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. The player has the ability to level grind after being beaten once, then come back and stomp the Leaders flat the next time around; the Leader has to stand there and take it.

<ul><li> Giovanni in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em> seems to be an example of this trope. The first time you fight him, his Kangaskhan will be ripping through your party left and right. It's somewhat easier the second time you fight him at Silph Co, as your Pokemon will have started evolving and learning better moves, whereas before Kangaskhan was using moves that were really strong for that point of the game. When you fight Giovanni in Viridian Gym, it is painfully easy. All of Giovanni's Pokemon are of the Ground type, with many being Rock types as well. That is the very first type you learned how to exploit back in Brock's Gym, and to make matters worse, you just got done facing a Fire Gym, so you're almost certain to have a decent Water type on you who can rip through Giovanni's team.

</li><li> The Rival stands outside this building, where you can fight him on the weekends. His levels are also a little tough at first, but you quickly surpass him. There is a way to make him increase his levels, but you have to beat the Elite Four <em>twenty times</em>.

They're a threat at first, when you have the Little Jack (a small wooden ship). Later on, they still have the same old wooden pirate ships, while you have a freaking <em>metal destroyer</em>. It's the equivalent of attacking a WWII destroyer with an 18th century sailing ship, and the results are as expected.

You can run across them early in the game in random encounters, but you can't kill them.

Even after defeating him, Letho uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> to turn the tide, with Geralt only surviving because Letho spares his life. During the second confrontation with Letho at the end of the game, Geralt collected all kinds of fancy new weapons and powers, while Letho largely stayed the same, turning this battle into a cakewalk.

He's the boss of the starter dungeon and reasonably challenging for a fledgling party. He then turns up again much, much later in the Chamber of Gorrors. The other monsters here are extremely challenging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> but Ra-Sep is totally unchanged and at this point you'll probably kill him in one hit.

</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanStarForce">Megaman Star Force</a></em> game, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Gemini Spark</a> begins the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> leading up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, he is still in his normal form, unlike his fellow FM-ians, who have to be fought in their upgraded "EX" forms.

They were supposed to be fought on multiple occasions, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Goldfish Poop Gang</a>...that the developers forgot about, so in the final product, you fight them twice - once at the beginning of the game (where they serve as the first boss), and the second time near the end (where they're as strong as before).

This is lampshaded by Benson after they are beaten, as he demanded to know how the heroes suddenly became much stronger than they are.

<ul><li> Often in Sid Meier's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> series of games, the human player will find that although the AI civs have advanced technologically at similar (or even greater) pace than the player did, they've failed to upgrade or replace a lot of obsolete units, even defensive ones (sometimes a human player may forget to as well). So once a player polishes off a couple of updated defensive units in an enemy city (or advances past better-defended outer cities), they find themselves fighting... pikemen or spearmen with tanks. Seemed to happen more in earlier editions of the game, by III or IV the AI was a bit better at upgrading. (And if in Civ II they had the Leonardo's Workshop wonder, such upgrades would be automatic.)
</li><li> Very, <em>very</em> common in many of Nippon Ichi's games such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series, due to the insanely high levels you can reach - the plotline fights are scaled on the assumption that you'll mostly only gain levels from plotline fights, and not go gallivanting off to the Dark World or Cave of Ordeals or Land of Carnage.
<ul><li> Even fights where you're supposed to be curbstomped by the overwhelmingly powerful boss (Beauty Queen Etna, anyone?) can be won through higher levels and good equipment, although that sometimes lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> due to plot derailment. (Defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters">Feinne</a> too early? Here comes Asagi to ruin everything and forcing you to start all over again.)
</li><li> Downplayed in Phantom Brave. Your steal resist is based on your level and class title. If the boss begins the battle unarmed and all you've done is powergrind your WEAPON and not your character...he'll just steal it and slap you with it for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a> without batting an eye. Due to their high steal rate <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunGuys">Fun Guys</a> and Bottlemails eventually become among the worst enemies for high-level characters to face down with weapons. So essentially they didn't need to level because you were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">nice enough to provide them with an alternative means to kill you</a>.
</li><li> The easiest way to grind experience and Mana is to create high-level dungeons and attach a weak title to it so that the enemies inside have reduced stats...but they will still retain their high level and steal rate, meaning you're in for a beating if you can't kill all before they get a turn.
</li><li> A handwave as well: when you beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Laharl for the first time, he rounds up his minions telling them to upgrade his weapons in the Item World.

<ul><li> Some battles have enemies that level. All random battles have the enemies level with you, and some story battles (usually the ones that feature monsters and no real story components) do as well. So if you've overleveled, you'll end up fighting some incredible powerful meteor-summoning chickens, to thrashing the next boss powered by dark magics with a wave of your hand.
</li><li> Interestingly, the player can suffer from overleveling, as some monsters are very strong, and while the player may gain some levels, they don't get the better equipment they're expected to get at those levels and facing those enemies. Rarely a significant problem as it's not a significant boost most of the time. However, as the high level gear carried by these scaling opponents can be stolen, this barrier can also be overcome, and provide the player a massive advantage beyond the simply higher stats from leveling up.

</li><li> A subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Awakening</a></em>: the boss of the Premonition appears early on in the actual story <em>weaker</em> than in the first battle, but that's justified since the Premonition is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome">a dream of the future.</a> Come Chapter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">23</span>, and the boss appears <em>exactly</em> the same as it did in the Premonition, meaning you should be able to easily curbstomp it...until you do and it turns out to have been hiding its true power, resulting in a rematch where the boss has stats actually befitting a boss this late in the game.

As the game progresses however not only do their warship designs fail to improve to counter your own, but they also rarely group them into fleets to give them a strength in numbers. Eventually, if you can survive their attacks long enough to research superior weaponry and logistics to field not only powerful warships but also group them in bigger fleets than they do, you can gang up on their mostly solitary vessels and destroy them with only light casualties, causing them to degrade from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a>.

To elaborate, the games use a system in which the enemies will be around your characters' levels (Specifically, the leader's level). However, after a certain point in time, the enemies in story battles stop leveling up, meaning you can go in and slaughter the final enemies at level 50, when they only cap out around the 30s.

<ul><li> The first is Metal Gear RAY; though this is a twice-subverted example.

</li><li> Jetstream Sam is battled shortly afterwards, and he curbstomps Raiden with relative ease.

</li><li> Every monster from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> suffer from this.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>

The Dark Masters, however, didn't. In their first appearence, they take turns beating the stuffing out of the Digidestineds' Digimon, Piedmon defeating both their Megas with no effort at all. Well the Digidestineds' Digimon <em>don't</em> get new forms, so they get more experienced and stronger with the ones that do have. They beat MetalSeadramon and Machinedramon by wisely using WarGreymon's Dramon Destroyers, which are super effective on Dramon type Digimon. Puppetmon is downed in one hit from MetalGarurumon, but Piedmon gets it the worst. Even though MagnaAngemon played a big role in his defeat, the same two Mega Digimon he effortlessly beat down before back him into a corner and force him to pull out his most underhanded trick. Even without them, the Ultimates in the Digidestineds' arsanal still manage to put up a good fight against him and once his trick is no longer of use, he gets his butt kicked. He saved himself for last but didn't bother getting stronger, so the Digidestined were able to catch up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>, the Royal Knights got hit by this hard. When they first fight EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon, they beat them in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>. Subsequent battles can best be described as the kids losing less and less badly. In "To Make the World Go Away", they are evenly matched against the Royal Knights and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lucemon</a> needs to intervene to defeat them. In the very next episode, they curb-stomp the Royal Knights. Each fight made EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon more skilled, but the Royal Knights didn't learn anything new.
</li><li> In Episode 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, Shellmon is defeated when Agumon digivolves to Greymon for the first time as the rookies aren't able to land a scratch on him. Come Episode 41, and all seven Rookies (except Gatomon, who's a naturally-digivolved Champion) manage to curbstomp Shellmon in seconds flat. This trope is even lampshaded by the Digi-destined to the Digimon.
</li><li> Subverted in Episodes 40-49. In the former episode, "Meet the Dark Masters", Angemon takes two blasts from Machinedramon who comes out of nowhere and the impact is damaging enough to revert him back to rookie form Patamon. In Episode 49, he still gets outmatched by Machinedramon like the other Digimon before Wargreymon finally destroys him, but he is able to take two blasts at a faster firing rate without being de-digivolved. Being a champion, two whole ranks below Machinedramon, maybe this example isn't so mild.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Otherworld Tournament Saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Almost every foe Goku had faced caused a riot in Hell. Goku and Picco...er, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Pikkon</a></em> go and beat their asses (Frieza and Cell are actually a threat at this point, but much less than they were when they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>).
</li><li> Justified in universe during the Android Saga. Dr. Gero and the Red Ribbon Army fought with Goku for years before being defeated and going underground. During his return monologue to the Z Fighters Dr. Gero, now Android 20, specifically mentions that he has been observing everyone fight and grow stronger for years and created statistical models to make sure that by the time the Androids were built and ready to attack they would be stronger than any of the Z Fighters. In other words: he specifically made sure to grind. During the first encounter Android 20 is able to easily put down Yamcha despite Yamcha having been trained by King Kai and spent a year specifically training for the eventual appearance of the androids. However Dr. Gero did all that math at the end of the Saiyan Saga and didn't follow the team into space so he failed to account for the huge power jumps that several members of the team (Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo specifically) got during the Freeza Saga. Piccolo even points this out before the fighting starts for real. As a result Android 19 is reduced to a joke battle and Android 20 only survives (temporarily) by running away.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Tao Pai Pai, who went from possibly the strongest human fighter on Earth and the first opponent to hand Goku a solid defeat early in the original <em>Dragon Ball</em> to a below-average enemy only able to defeat the weakest of the supporting cast before being beaten senseless by a mid-level supporting cast member in the Tournament Arc at the end of the series. When he appears again in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> (albeit only in the anime), Goku is so out of Tao's league that he's basically a joke villain who spends the episode engaged in wacky hijinks trying (hilariously unsuccessfully) to outsmart Goku. When Tao realizes Gohan is Goku's son (after using his signature move which didn't harm Gohan), he quickly flees.
</li><li> Pilaf. This little guy and his halfwit minions first appeared when the series was more gag-oriented. They would appear again when the series beginning to focus on action more, trying to steal Dragon Balls from Goku, right after he had become strong enough to defeat an army of terrorists <em>single-handedly.</em> To say the battle was one-sided would be a bit of an understatement. In fact, they themselves invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> by releasing Demon King Piccolo, who was the incarnation of Kami's cast-off evil.
</li><li> Cui, Dodoria, and Zarbon are all part of Frieza's army, and mostly take it easy as they conquered planets. They few times they did get into fights, it was against vastly inferior competition. All three were known to have higher power readings than Vegeta, until his battle on Earth. One by one, Vegeta manages to pick off Frieza's men, noting that his powers have gotten stronger while Frieza's men have been relaxing around him.
<ul><li> The prime example being Zarbon, as he defeats Vegeta with ease once he transforms during their first fight and nearly kills him. During the second fight, Zarbon is <em>still</em> slightly stronger than Vegeta... But Zarbon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">skills simply aren't up to the same level</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Vegeta's</a> after the latter's constant fighting. Vegeta is quick to realize that the boost he got from the first fight was enough for his superior skills to close the gap, and proceeds to capitalize on it to inflict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a> on Zarbon.
</li></ul></li><li> Taking into account all of <em>Z, GT</em>, and the movies, Frieza returns and gets curbstomped immediately no less than <em>five times;</em> once with King Cold and four times after his death. After being killed by Trunks (he <em>did</em> get a power boost from his cyborg implants, just not nearly enough), he terrorizes Hell and gets wrecked by Pikkon in a couple hits. He gets back to the living world in the movies <em>Fusion Reborn</em> and <em>Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans</em>, but gets beaten up by the end of each movie. Perhaps his most embarrassing reappearance was in <em>GT</em>, where he gets beaten by an <em>ice machine.</em>
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted for the most part</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s adaptation), where upon revival, Frieza (who in fact <em>never</em> level ground before because he was born so strong) trains for four months, and gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode">Golden Super Mode</a> on par with Super Saiyan Blue Goku.

This is the exact same flaw that Frieza's "100% power" form had when Goku defeated him for the first time. While he's able to go toe-to-toe with Goku for a while, it's not long before use of this new super form leaves him exhausted, just like when he tried to use his full power back on Namek</span>. Come <em>Super</em>'s Universe Survival arc, though, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frieza meditated while in Hell and managed to solve <em>that</em> issue by the time he's revived for the Tournament of Power</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">Inverted</a> with Cell. When he first appears, Cell drains humans of their life force by sucking every last bit of their body through his stinger. This allows him to receive nourishment and to increase his battle power. He starts off being slightly weaker than Piccolo (after he fused with Kami) and Android 17. After absorbing thousands of humans, he becomes more powerful than both Piccolo's and 17's combined attacks and beats them senseless. He later achieves his main goal of absorbing the two androids and makes a massive jump each time in power. He also possesses the Saiyan's power to recover from near-death and come back stronger, though he is permanently defeated shortly after displaying this ability.
</li></ul></li><li> Defied with Hit, a renowned assassin whose biggest strength is that he <em>does</em> level-grind like crazy. During his tournament fight with Goku, he levels his time skip up to more than double its original limit <em>mid-fight</em>, and every appearance since then he's showcased a new power that he didn't have before, like using the time he skips to turn intangible.

Since Natsu has already obtained his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp">Second Origin</a>, he figures taking someone with the exact power of Hades will be a cakewalk all by himself.

<ul><li> Shin has very explicitly not become any stronger between the two fights he had with Kenshiro, leading to his defeat in the rematch. It's later implied that he didn't want to become stronger, as he knew it wouldn't be nearly enough to take on Raoh when he came calling. Instead, Shin was just trying to have Ken become strong enough to protect Julia from any threat.
</li><li> Jagi believed that a younger brother could never defeat an older one, so you'd expect this. Except he's <em>still</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> Hokuto Shinken practitioner and Kenshiro has already defeated him once.

All of this allows Jagi to go from helpless against pre-Shin Kenshiro to capable of... scratching Ken. A massive increase in strength, just not nearly enough to beat Kenshiro.
</li><li> Shuu (who's not really a villain, he was just acting like one) not only didn't become stronger in the years between his two battles with Kenshiro, but actually became <em>weaker</em> due exchanging his sight for the right to spare Kenshiro.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Raoh had a lot on his plate</a>. He spent most of the time between those two fights time recuperating from the wounds he suffered in that fight and his first battle with Toki, and had to restore his authority over his domain, then deal with the armies of the Last General of Nanto as soon as he had healed. It's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a>, as Raoh himself declared he had grown a lot in the years between Ryuuken's death and meeting his brothers again; Kenshiro and Toki just took his growth for granted.

It doesn't turn out that way: the squabbling had led the humans to refine their military technology and tactics to the point that the first human world to seriously confront the rather stagnant alien empire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">easily defeated them</a>, even before other human worlds started putting aside their differences to join up with the winning side.

In the first book, they're terrifying and treated as Run or Die, basically. In the next couple of books, they're still really tough, but the protagonists get better at dealing with them. Later in the series, they're only slightly harder to kill than Trollocs. Of course, this was foreshadowed in the first book- Moiraine explicitly points out that any even somewhat skilled channeler can beat them without much trouble, and by the midpoint of the series all the protagonists are either quite powerful channelers or have some other ability to put them on that level.

</li><li> This is an invoked trope as a strategy in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> series. The Gbaba win a long war of attrition against humanity due to superior numbers and initial starting technology, but human researchers discover they haven't advanced in possibly millennia and show no inclination (or possibly ability) to do so, even as they face increasing losses due to humanity racing to catch up, and they realize that if humanity had only had a few more years of their normal technological advancement, they'd be on even terms and then shortly thereafter curb-stomping them. They establish a secret colony at Safehold where the last survivors of humanity can hide out, with the plan being to create a place where humanity can regrow a significant population and then continue their technological advancement, so that when they emerge from hiding, humanity can get revenge on the Gbaba from a point of superiority.

After a while, they come to realize that they face overwhelming force because they're facing fleets that have been built up over centuries, but only come from a handful of systems so there's no way that the Bugs could have the infrastructure to replace them as fast as they're being lost, nor make significant changes in the technology they deploy because they're using ships they built a long time ago. Once the allies realize this, they begin fighting battles of attrition because they can afford to replace ships and the Bugs can't. By the end they can routinely beat outnumbered Bug fleets and start becoming more concerned with winning the war quickly to keep their own casualties down.

In 17 years the humans went from being ruled by a single crappy Horvath cruiser, to having multiple battle stations that can defeat entire Rangoran invasion fleets (which wiped the floor with the Horvath and are busy conquering everybody else in sight), since no other race in the galaxy has felt the need to improve their technology in thousands of years. In Chapter 30 of "Citadel", the Rangoran analyst's models show the Rangora could not have matched what Earth has already done in those 17 years, that with the current two battle stations the Rangora will not be able to successfully invade and defeat the Earth system, and that within 20 years the additional three battle stations that are actively being built will enable the humans to invade and defeat the entire Rangoran Empire.

Adventurers living inside Orario have access to the Dungeon, offering both more opportunity to level grind as well as stronger opponents. Outside Orario the monsters are generally weaker and rarer meaning those outside the Dungeon City have both less chance to gain levels and the chances they do get are of less benefit in terms of levelling or developing skills and abilities. The end result is for outside Adventurers to generally top out around Level 3 while in Orario Level 3 is considered mid-range at best, most Familia heads are Level 4 or 5 and Loki and Freya Familia bost multiple Level 6 adventurers and Freya Familia has the benefit of Ottar, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">only known Level 7</a>.

</li><li> Notable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the first season, the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, The Master, was shown as this terrifying, ancient vampire whose history of atrocities was enough to plague Buffy's nightmares and was able to easily imprison and torture Angel in an alternate universe. By series eight in the comic series, both had progressed to the point that a possessed Angel was able to shatter his skull when he was temporarily revived.
</li><li> The Turok-Han were an ancient and feared breed of vampires who were considered monsters even among ordinary vampires. Buffy's first encounter with one Turok-Han in "Bring on the Night" led to her being bashed around like a ragdoll and nearly getting killed. By the final battle with the First Evil, the Turok Hans' have decreased notably in performance. While the first Turok-Han forced Buffy to use every possible resource to defeat it the second time around, the later Turok-Han seem evenly matched against the newly activated Slayers and even normal humans such as Xander and Dawn. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshaded</a> by creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> in his audio commentary for the episode, who acknowledged the continuity issue with the Turok Han's powers.
<ul><li> Weirdly, Joss misses an easy explanation for the power disparity: The first Turok-han had been free for some time and had had plenty of time to feed. This was not true of the others.

See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, because sometimes the Daleks really were laughably ineffectual and sometimes the Doctor was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">just that good</a>.

In season 1, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">the Reverse Flash</a> was stronger, faster and a better fighter than Barry, repeatedly defeated him, and required help from multiple allies to be taken down.

When Barry encounters the Reverse Flash again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrisisOnEarthX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrisisOnEarthX">Crisis on Earth-X</a></em>, Thawne once again provides a challenge for Barry, although Barry does defeat him in the end.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em>, Xavier St. Cloud used to be considered one of the deadliest immortals in the world, and trying to fight him was considered a death sentence. However, eventually he stopped fighting and focused on stealing to support his lavish lifestyle. As a result, either his sword skills decayed or his old rivals like Duncan MacLeod improved enough to beat him.
</li><li> Happens in a number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> shows, for various reasons:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a></em> antagonists, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a>-using Dopants, are restricted by a level cap based on their compatibility with the type of Gaia Memory that they use: the only way to get stronger is to find a Memory that they're more compatible with. One villain doesn't know about the cap, tries to level grind, and meets a messy end because of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em> sets up several antagonist Riders who begin far more powerful than their heroic counterparts, but most of them never gain more powerful forms or gain them much more slowly than Gaim does. Oren Pierre Alfonzo begins as a powerful villain as Kamen Rider Bravo, but soon turns into a recurring joke, while the New Generation Riders are the central threat during the second quarter of the series, but are permanently outmatched once Gaim and Baron gain forms rivaling or exceeding theirs. The only villain to avert the trope is Kamen Rider Duke, who is shown constantly upgrading his armor (which was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> to begin with) and remains a threat until his death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid">Kamen Rider Ex-Aid</a></em> is the only show to avert this trope for <em>every</em> monster, as every Bugster increases in level each time they're defeated. The trope still plays out due to the Riders leveling up faster and gaining more experience than the Bugsters do, but they make a lot more of an effort to stay relevant than returning monsters usually would.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild">Kamen Rider Build</a></em> has this trope on purpose, as the Build System and Transteam System were both part of a secret government <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> project. The Build System can grow stronger but requires surviving exposure to a highly toxic gas in order to use; by contrast, the Transteam System can be used by anyone but can't grow beyond its initial parameters and was relegated to being an "aggressor" to help Build get stronger through combat. One of the two villains discards the now-useless power in favor of becoming a proper Kamen Rider himself, while the other gradually reveals that he was already far more powerful than anyone else in the show. By the time the heroes actually catch up to him, he gets his hands on his real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Transformation Trinket</a>, outs himself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and spends the entire rest of the show <em>constantly</em> level grinding to ensure they can never catch up again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZiO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZiO">Kamen Rider Zi-O</a></em> implies that its Another Riders, monsters who've stolen the powers and histories of the previous Kamen Riders, <em>can't</em> level grind due to being unworthy of the power they've stolen. If anything the stolen powers get weaker over time, so that an Another Rider is at its strongest when it's first created.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZeroOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZeroOne">Kamen Rider Zero-One</a></em>:
<ul><li> The beginning of the series sets up the villainous Kamen Rider Horobi as being far beyond the human Riders at first, but by the end of the first quarter he's surpassed and defeated. His dragon Jin only fares slightly better, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">getting dangerous</a> to avenge the fallen Horobi only gives him enough of a power boost to elevate him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a> status.
</li><li> The cycle then repeats itself with the next villain, Kamen Rider Thouser. Thouser initially manhandles the heroic Riders, but eventually proves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>; he relies entirely on his suit's strength and falls short when more experienced fighters use upgrades to close the power gap. Even Horobi gets the better of Thouser when he comes back in play, <em>without</em> upgrades as he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">Strong and Skilled</a> to begin with. For extra irony, Thouser freely <em>gave</em> the Riders the upgrades used to beat him: For Zero-One he had intended for it to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrade</a> (that also locked Zero-One out of using any of his other powers), never expecting that Zero-One's friends would find a way to counteract <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">The Berserker</a> side effects. And then he handed one to Vulcan because he thought he was brainwashed and under his thumb, but underestimated Vulcan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside">Fighting from the Inside</a> and taking back control.

At first, when humans get Ancient technology in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a>,</em> they can curb stomp the Go'auld. Fast forward a few years, and their new ships can ignore the human beam weapons and destroy them. This is also shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Lucian Alliance</a> is able to engage Earth's most advanced ship, the <em>George Hammond</em> (equipped with those same plasma beams), with three upgraded Ha'taks, and the <em>Hammond</em> receives substantial damage in the fight. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the Lucian Alliance (largely composed of humans) has every incentive to upgrade their tech, unlike the Goa'uld, who spent millennia sitting on their asses.
<ul><li> The expectation of this trope is such that the writers had to answer it publicly. They got a lot of flack about it - since ships like the <em>Hammond</em> can fight Ori ships, which can easily beat the first human ships beefed up with Asgard tech, which could easily beat the Goa'uld ships they were intended to go up against, when three pyramid ships hearkening back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">original movie</a> showed up, everyone expected it to be like the Death Star vs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">SS Minnow</a>. When it wasn't, the fandom went nuts and the writers gave the obvious, simple answer: Did you think that while Earth kept advancing, the rest of the universe had stood still?
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> series:
<ul><li> When the Borg appear first their Cubes are unstoppable even by an entire fleet of Federation ships, and must be beaten by trickery. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em> comes around, increased fleet size and new technology mean the Cube is far from unscratchable, although it does still take <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain Picard hearing the voice of the collective</span> to find a weak spot to finally destroy it.
</li><li> Then you have the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> series finale, where the titular ship uses technology from 20 years in the future to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> Borg Cubes with the Cubes barely able to scratch the paint on the ship. The Borg end up assimilating the new tech, but due to a virus infecting the Borg Queen, only get it implemented on one sphere that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">conveniently pulls <em>Voyager</em> inside itself so it can be destroyed from within</span>.
</li><li> In the case of the Borg, it's not so much that the villain <em>forgot</em> to level grind as that the villain is <em>incapable</em> of level-grinding in the conventional manner. <em>Voyager</em> establishes that the Borg are completely incapable of invention or innovation. The only way they can grow is through assimilation...and most of the technology in the Delta Quadrant that was worth assimilating already had been. The rest was in the hands of those smart and/or powerful enough to avoid assimilation. Essentially, we have an entire villain faction that had already hit its level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">cap</a>, while the heroes haven't and thus can keep on grinding. This is the main reason the Borg have trouble with Species 8472 (STO calls them the Undine), whose extremely aggressive immune system prohibits assimilation, which also applies to their extremely capable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a>.

</li><li> Can be invoked by good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">optimization tactics</a> in any tabletop RPG that allows the players to customize their characters during creation. <em>Will</em> be invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul">Monty Haul</a> gameplay. As such, this trope has the potential to appear prominently in nearly every tabletop RPG. It's also likely to happen in a much more literal sense: as the players level up their characters, monsters that were a signifcant threat previously challenging will become laughably easy opponents in combat, while monsters that the players previously viewed as far too powerful to challenge directly will likely end up crushed beneath the players' boots.

While the Inner Sphere blew themselves back to a technology level <em>before</em> that of the peak of the Star League in a three-century war, the Clans (having left before said war started) continued to improve the weapons technology to the point that the 'Mech designs and weapons they bring in their invasion seem flat-out impossible, which combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">the rigorous training</a> the Clanners go through means that the only battles the Inner Sphere forces win early on are usually won through superior tactics, outright trickery, and the Clans only bringing four out of the almost twenty Clans on the invasion. Also played straight on a philosophical level by the Clans - their belief that a warrior is past their prime by thirty means that their warriors have far less time to level grind compared to the soldiers in the Inner Sphere, who have been known to fight until their seventies, with all the combat experience that comes along with it.

But by the end of the second season, although still one of ther Avatar's more dangerous adversaries, Aang and Katara were able to defeat her by working together, and by the time of the series finale, Zuko is able to hold his own against her and ultimately win due to having developed a stationary and defensive style to contrast her offensive and energy-intensive one.

</li><li> When Steven first faced Eyeball and Aquamarine, he was still young and inexperienced with his powers and thus struggled to put up any kind of a fight against them.

</li><li> However, theres a bit of an inversion on another front. While Homeworld has been developing technology that eventually outclasses the Crystal Gems capabilities, like the Hand Ship or Aquamarines Wand, the Crystal Gems chose not to make advances or share their knowledge with humanity.
