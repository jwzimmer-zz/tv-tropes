If you complain or write home to your parents, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">they won't believe you</a> (assuming your mail even makes it out of the school, that is — it's not uncommon for such schools to actively screen their students' outgoing mail). The school might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool">Military School</a>, where you'll face the wrath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> every day, and be subjected to horrific hazing rituals. In the worst cases you could be sexually abused or even murdered while staying there. And God help if the school actually is a Reform School - an institution for juvenile offenders. Such institutions are basically prisons with schoolrooms.
</p><p>Had (has?) some elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Boarding schools were not a Victorian innovation, but the institution was embraced as a means of counteracting the softening, emasculating influence of mothers and preparing young men for the harsh rigours of the world of business and Empire. The move to purposefully harsh institutions as a solution to parental mollycoddling took place in the context of the early-mid Victorian love of childhood and doting parenthood, which it was later feared would render the new generation of the better sort of people - i.e. the middle and upper classes - too soft to maintain Anglo supremacy. Thus, boarding schools were intended to break the attendants to prevent them from becoming 'soft' and/or homosexual.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lvwy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lvwy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lvwy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Good luck with <em>that</em>. Given the rampant molestation, BDSM and rape of younger students by older ones as well as by staff (see C.S. Lewis), many probably left these cathedrals of learning thinking they <em>were</em> gay, whether or not they were.</span> More specifically they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">instill discipline and self-discipline</a>, deference to authority, strict morals, a vague sense of the Christian religion, and teamwork. This was, of course, in addition to all the usual things one expects a public school (a school open to the paying public as opposed to a private school, which was more exclusive) to do. For real life examples, see also the section in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanU">Strawman U</a> page for "St. Jim Jonestown Academy." The overtly strict atmosphere of the boarding schools produced a proverb <em>When a lower class kid turns bad, he is sent to a borstal; when an upper class kid turns bad, he is sent to a boarding school</em>. Some boarding schools hardly differed from reform schools (borstals) except on curriculum.

The agencies in charge of these schools forced parents to turn over their children as wards of the government and sent them, often hundreds of miles, away from their families and communities. Their clothing and ornaments were burned on arrival and their hair<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kdhs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kdhs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kdhs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">long hair had and still has great significance for Indian people</span> was cut short. A few of these institutions did provide a quality western-style education, or at least taught useful trades or skills, but the main purpose was to "kill the Indian and save the man" — forcing these children to accept that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSavageIndian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSavageIndian">their traditional customs and languages are primitive and evil,</a> forbidding them to speak their own languages, and enforcing the rules with cruel punishments. Children died at these schools, and they died running away. Sexual abuse was common. Once they graduated and were deemed "civilized," they didn't fit in with their communities because of the mental conditioning they went through, and couldn't fit in with society at large because they were seen not as human beings, but more as tamed "savages" that could act "civilized." Most of them ended up as menial servants. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1waOvZ9qvE">To this day, the horrors of the residential schools<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> affect their descendants and <a class="urllink" href="https://boardingschoolhealing.org/">several groups<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> exist to <a class="urllink" href="https://wellbriety.com/">help today's Native Americans from ancestral pain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that has been transmitted to them.

The devil-worshiping bullies had attended the place just before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, at the time when the place had apparently fit the trope.

However, it's ultimately a subversion: the teaching staff, particularly the Headmistress, do genuinely care about the girls, and while they're entirely dysfunctional, it's made plain that this is because of their upbringing (the majority of them were sent to boarding school so their parents didn't have to deal with them, and the older ones are bitterly aware of it).

He had simply chalked up some of the more horrific memories of the place as a child's imagination, especially the monstrous, abusive headmaster (who seemingly didn't cast a shadow) and the brutal death of one of his school friends. Even without the headmaster, the school was a bad place even for this trope, as the prefects were psychotic bullies and the teachers sexually harassed their students. It finally reaches its climax when Batman discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only are the killer, Mr. Whisper, and his old headmaster the same person, he's actually a centuries-old former monk who sold his soul to the devil to avoid dying from the plague in 17th-century Vienna, and has spent the years since working on a way to keep the Devil from claiming his soul. Among other things, he's been serial murdering children for years to fuel his magic, Bruce's friend being one of his victims.</span>

<ul><li> You also find out that Hailsham is actually quite nice compared to the schools run by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> people who approve of the whole scheme instead of reformers who settled for giving the clones normal(ish) childhoods when they realized that they couldn't convince the public to scrap the project.</span>

</li><li> Dotheboys Hall in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby">Nicholas Nickleby</a></em>. The villainous Wackford Squeers is said to be based on a real headmaster, who was so cruel that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleReferencePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleReferencePun">blinded some of his pupils</a>.
<ul><li> It was reported that Dickens had created a minor backlash against Boarding Schools and a demand for quality assurance from his readers because of that gruesome description.
</li><li> Squeers was based on a man named William Shaw, headmaster of the Bowes Academy in northern England. Dickens made no effort to disguise this; the novel ruined Shaw and led to the closure of Bowes. However, there is quite a bit of evidence to suggest that Dickens unfairly maligned Shaw — the incident with the blinded boys, for example, has been attributed by some historians to an illness which arrived in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, and Shaw is recorded as having employed an eye specialist (at great expense) to try and cure them. Whatever the truth about him, quite a few people weren't happy with Dickens' treatment of him and apparently installed a window to him in the local church after his death.

Had it not been for people like Steerforth, Mr. Bell or Tommy Traddles, it would've been even worse.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> rounds out the Charles Dickens hat-trick: Ebenezer Scrooge spent his childhood years at one. Uniquely, <em>A Christmas Carol's</em> horror is on a more abstract, intellectual level: at Scrooge's school, his teachers strove to pound out any and all glimmers of imagination and fantasy and replace them with cold, hard, facts. (This is also in Dickens' <em>Hard Times</em>). Said teachers are not presented as out-and-out villains (indeed, we never see them as characters in their own right), but as practitioners of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">then-accepted teaching standards</a>. The Ghost of Christmas Past effectively punctures Scrooge's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> over his school days and forces him to confront what it <em>really</em> did.
</li><li> The Stjärnberg boarding school in the Swedish novel <em>Ondskan</em> by journalist and action-novel author Jan Guillou, recently turned into a film. It was based on Mr Guillou's own boarding school experience in the 1950s. When he became a journalist in the 1960's, he managed to shut down that school by exposing its horrors to the general public.
<ul><li> Funny story, he actually decided to become a journalist because it turned out to be the most effective way to shut down the school. Then he spent twenty years practicing his writing in journalism and in lesser novels like the Carl Hamilton series before he felt confident enough to write the book. We might call that dedication.
</li></ul></li><li> The school in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Brightly Burning</a></em> isn't a boarding school, but otherwise matches this trope. An elite group of "sixth form" students can get away with anything, including severely beating a younger boy for not stealing on their behalf. At least until they manage to cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">Traumatic Superpower Awakening</a> to the lead character (the one who would go on to be called Lavan <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Firestorm</a></strong>) and got most of themselves killed. The incident was so big that it got the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">King</a></em> himself aware of things. Considering what Valdemar is built on (it's what America is <em>supposed</em> to be at heart, enforced thanks to the Companions) no one is pleased at all and a very swift and permanent reform is forced on the school, with plenty of people and rich families who knew what was really going on punished as well.
</li><li> Jill's and Eustace's school, Experiment House, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair">The Silver Chair</a></em>. Rather than the "abusively strict and draconian" type, however, Experiment House is the less-common variant of the trope in which the trouble is the complete <em>lack</em> of discipline; its faculty, fancying themselves modern and progressive, allow bullies to run wild, creating a hellish environment for the rest of the students like Jill and Eustace.
<ul><li> Also, either Experiment House or another Boarding School Of Horrors is also implied to have contributed to Edmund's mean and resentful behavior in the first book; upon his recovery, Lucy observes that he looks better than he has "since his first term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a>'s essay "Such, Such Were the Joys" is about his experiences in such a school.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the teachers of the school considered young Eric Blair as one of the truly rising stars in achievement and predicted him a bright future in the literature.
</li></ul></li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> in <em>Surprised by Joy</em> talks candidly about his days at Malvern College where the fagging system was in full play — as an underclassman he was worked to exhaustion — and nearly all the boys were either "Tarts" or "Bloods". (So much for the theory that these schools would prevent homosexuality.) He refuses to condemn the rampant pederasty saying that the authorities condoned much worse crimes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>
<ul><li> The Fools' Guild School. A thoroughly miserable place where students sleep on hard pallets, are woken at the crack of dawn, and spend hours memorizing ancient jokes that simply aren't funny and being drilled in slapstick routines that are even less so. The irony is amped up by it being next door to the Assassins' Guild, which is a much more cheerful place and lets the students go outside.
</li><li> The downside of the Assassins' Guild is that the number of students tends to be considerably smaller at the end of the year than it was at the beginning due to the student rivalries and the Guild's firm belief in competitive graduation exams.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em> features 71-Hour-Ahmed, a warrior <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a></span> from Klatch who attended the Assassin's Guild school. He notes that after seven years of an Ankh-Morpork public school, "patronized by the sons of gentlemen", life among the most feared warrior tribe in Klatch is an absolute picnic.
</li><li> Hugglestones, a boarding school for the sons of the very rich designed to turn boys into men... apparently by making them play a lot of violent full-contact sports and only allowing those who survive (either by brute force or just being smart enough to avoid the scrum while still acting like they're involved in the action) to graduate; William de Worde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em> is an example of the latter sort of student. Hugglestones is also described as physically resembling a maximum-security prison, with the difference that prison inmates get better treatment. In <em>Mrs Bradshaw's Handbook</em>, Mrs Bradshaw watches the boys getting on the train at the end of term; some in wheelchairs, some on stretchers, and two in coffins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em> has the Girl's Working School, which cranks this up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Room101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Room101">Room 101</a> levels. Three of the main characters were in it at some point, and it shows in different ways. (Unlike most Boarding Schools of Horrors, it's for <em>poor</em> girls; it's something between an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a> and a Magdalene laundry). Lt Blouse went to a less extreme version - he's perfectly happy to eat scubbo (soup made of boiled water and anything remotely edible) with the men, as it's what he got at school. Jackrum later quips that "He went to a school for young gentlemen, so prison will be just like old times."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Though everything isn't perfect there, Hogwarts in most of the Harry Potter books is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">not an example</a>. It's Harry's favorite place in the world, <em>most</em> of the teachers seem to care about the students and try to teach them, and it's generally protrayed as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfAdventure">Academy of Adventure</a> full of friendship. However, it veers towards this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, when Dolores Umbridge shows up and gets beloved teachers fired, spies on students, institutes corporal punishment, and generally rules with an iron fist. Hogwarts definitely becomes one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em> when Voldemort takes control through his lackeys, the Carrow siblings. Torture of students becomes a routine punishment, and students are encouraged to hurt each other to maintain order. Neville was apparently attacked and injured for refusing to torture another student.
</li><li> Smeltings Academy, the all-boys Muggle school Dudley goes to and that Uncle Vernon attended in his youth, seems to channel the Victorian schools that originated this trope. The uniform includes a gnarled stick for the students to hit each other with when the teachers are not looking. This is supposedly a great help in preparing the students for the future.
</li><li> This is presumably the case at St. Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys, the school that Harry attends in the cover story that Uncle Vernon tells his sister Marge to prevent her finding out the truth about Harry. At Vernon's prompting, Harry admits to receiving frequent beatings intended to stamp out his deviant behavior. It's unclear if the school actually exists in the narrative, or if Uncle Vernon fabricated it for the story.
</li></ul></li><li> The Oakhurst foundation from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowGrail">Shadow Grail</a></em> series takes Hogwarts and carefully removes everything fun and most of the sheer good fortune that kept the school from having a running body count every year. In fact, in the first book, the main characters go through some old records and realize that one student dies, disappears, or goes insane roughly once every six weeks. The casualty rate starts going <em>up</em> in the following books.
</li><li> The Prufrock Preparatory school in <em>The Austere Academy</em>, Book The Fifth of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>. The buildings are even shaped like <em>gravestones</em>. The school is run by Vice Principal Nero. When the Baudelaire siblings first arrive he informs them about the fine dormitories they have, but that unless students have parental permission, they must sleep on hay in a tin shack (known as the Orphan's Shack). He considers himself to be a genius and thinks that he plays the violin well, but in fact he is unworthy, stupid, mean, arrogant, obnoxious, annoying, and cannot play the violin well at all. Nonetheless, students must attend his lengthy violin recitals every day, or else they must buy him a large bag of candy and watch him eat it. The Baudelaires are forced to live in the Orphans' Shack which is infested with crabs, fungus drips from the ceiling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and the tin walls are covered in horrible wallpaper (green with pink hearts)</a>. They are also regularly bullied by a rude, violent girl named Carmelita Spats and Sunny (a baby) is made to be a secretary for Nero. There's also a rule that if students are late to class (or Sunny is late to work) their hands will be tied behind their backs during meals and they'll have to "lean down at eat their food like a dog". Sunny has her silverware taken away because she must work in the administrative building where students are not allowed. Also if students are late to meals (which are not at specified times) their glasses are taken away and beverages are served in large puddles on the trays.
<ul><li> The school motto: MEMENTO MORI (Remember You Will Die). It can also be translated as "Remember Your Mortality" which also indicates, that you aren't anything more than a human. Which means, that if you are a troublemaker (or if the teachers see you as one) you can — and will — be broken down, by any gruesome means possible.

</li><li> In the Inspector Linley detective novel <em>Well Schooled In Murder</em>, a murder is covered up by the staff and all 600 pupils of a Boarding School of Horrors.

</li><li> The horribly built school in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarBetweenThePitifulTeachersAndTheSplendidKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarBetweenThePitifulTeachersAndTheSplendidKids">The War Between The Pitiful Teachers And The Splendid Kids</a></em> is not only a dumping ground for "bad" students (the main POV character is actually very intelligent but infuriated his teacher by making up words ("inkwart- that blister that develops when you write too many stupid English assignments") and sticking to them; another is a very smart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a>; another was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">raised by hyenas</a>) but also for <em>bad teachers</em> like the self-absorbed art teacher who jousted as The Rococo Knight.
</li><li> Crunchem Hall in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">Matilda</a></em> fits the trope to a T, despite being a day school. The headmistress (who is a fan of Wackford Squeers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby">Nicholas Nickleby</a></em> and admits it) delights in, among other things, locking students in an iron maiden-style closet full of broken glass and nails, forcing students to eat chocolate cake until they either vomit or explode, and picking students up by their hair and hammer-throwing them across the school grounds.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a> wrote about his horrific experiences at a boarding school in his first autobiographical book, <em>Boy: Tales of Childhood</em>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisDuncan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisDuncan">Lois Duncan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DownADarkHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DownADarkHall">Down a Dark Hall</a></em>, the headmistress is forcing her trapped students to channel the ghosts of dead geniuses...which causes enough mental damage to drive them to insanity or suicide.
</li><li> The school in Cinda Williams Chima's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeirChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeirChronicles">The Wizard Heir</a></em> is mainly a way for its wizard headmaster to locate young wizards to bind to him; the non-magical students are tormented — and sometimes killed — by the others, and when the protagonist refuses to go along, he's subjected to months of constant mental torture.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland">Otherland</a></em>, Felix Jongleur, evil mastermind of the Grail Brotherhood, grew up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> era and was sent to Cranleigh, a British boarding school that he remembers as a place of abject misery and torture, not the least of which because he is French. Even nearly two hundred years later (yes, he is that old), these memories give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare">Past Experience Nightmares</a>. Interestingly, they also cause him to pick Paul Jonas as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a> "daughter's" tutor, because he went to the same school, and this forms a minor plot point late in the story.
</li><li> The 19th century Austro-Hungarian military academy portrayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheConfusionsOfYoungTorless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheConfusionsOfYoungTorless">The Confusions of Young Törless</a> </em> is one of these. While we never see much of the rest of the student body, the plot centers on the sadistic torment of one of its students, observed dispassionately by the title character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EllaEnchanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EllaEnchanted">Ella Enchanted</a></em>: Ella attends one which she eventually escapes. It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for Hattie ordering her about and the punishment of meals being taken away if you talked back to a teacher.
</li><li> Coates Academy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone">Gone</a></em> might count. It starts out as a boarding school for "difficult" kids, which translates into sadists, sociopaths, juvenile delinquents, bullies, and a few decent kids who talked back too often, or whose parents just wanted to get rid of them. It is described as a cold, foreboding place where the bullies rule. Then, things only get worse (for the few decent kids) after some of the kids develop super powers, the adults all vanish, and the bullies <em>really</em> rule. Eventually, it gets to be unbearable for every character except Drake.
</li><li> Drearcliff Grange in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNewman">Kim Newman</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretsOfDrearcliffGrangeSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretsOfDrearcliffGrangeSchool">The Secrets of Drearcliff Grange School</a></em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool">Superhero School</a> for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of Girls' School stories such as <em>The Silent Three</em>. The main character is warned that the prefects can punish her for having a red mark on her face by slapping her (and can continue to do so as long as she continues to have red marks on her face), and will already have ritually burnt the doll in her luggage at the stake (as it turns out they haven't, they're waiting to torture it in front of her). But then <em>that</em> gets deconstructed, when we're told that after three weeks she no longer sees the school as either good or bad; it's simply how things are.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedPlanet">Red Planet</a></em>, the main characters are sent to a dispassionately oppressive boarding school where the headmaster attempts to steal the hero's (sentient) pet and the heroes discover a plot against the colony.
</li><li> In Morton Rhue's <em>Boot Camp</em>, the boot camp "Harmony Lake" is this, its methods a mix between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> (on the instructors' part) and the Experiment House from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair">The Silver Chair</a></em> (on the bullies' part)... and things still manage to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a> in the end. Given that it was based on Tranquility Bay, a "Teen Treatment" facility in Jamaica for troubled American teens that was infamous for the horrendous treatment of the kids sent there and the deaths that occurred, it's understandable.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAntonWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAntonWilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">The Historical Illuminatus II</a> - The Widow's Son</em>, Edward Babcock lives through Hell at Eton when the School launches a witch-hunt to find and detect actively gay pupils. Wilson describes a Gestapo-like interrogation of all pupils who are called, one by one, in front of a panel of teachers and urged to confess to the cardinal and disgusting sin of sodomy, so that they can repent and their souls may be saved before God. Knowing to confess to being gay means expulsion, disgrace, and lifelong ostracism, Babcock bluffs and lies his way out of it, although he is both frightened and intimidated. After the first flush of elation at having successfully lied to his teachers, he is pulled up cold by the appalling realisation his lover is yet to be questioned. As the boys are being called in by alphabetical order, he realises Geoffrey Wildeblood will have a long agonising wait... eventually he realises Geoffrey has fled the school and has killed himself, rather than face shame and disgrace.
</li><li> Cackle's Academy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorstWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorstWitch">The Worst Witch</a></em> teeters on being an example. The school is described as cold during the winter and the girls are forced to spend break outdoors even when it's cold. The food is also always served cold (mostly because it takes half an hour to carry up to the Great Hall from the kitchens). And while there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a> Miss Hardbroom and a few strict others, the headmistress Miss Cackle is good natured and friendly. The school's conditions are all in the name of tradition rather than any desire to be cruel. The TV series does also help make the school a little more welcoming.

Pupils' clothes are burnt on arrival, they are given rough sackcloth robes instead, and no shoes. They are only given water to drink and wash with, and no food or soap. After a couple of days, a wizard shows them how to make food appear using a magical jewel ... but most of them aren't (yet) able to do this, and the headmaster actively discourages them from helping each other, threatening that they will be killed if they do. It is mentioned that only one of the group will become a wizard and ever see his parents again, the others will ... become part of the school.

Initially left at a strict but reasonable boarding school, she later ends up dumped in one of these. The Pension Marcassin is a hellhole that makes Dickens' worst schools look good. Even the best students are ridiculed as completely without merit, the rules are set up so that it is impossible not to break them, punishments are sadistic and the food is ghastly. Lily isn't even a student most of the seven years she spends there; her tuition money runs out and she ends up like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess">Sara Crewe</a></em>, an indentured servant.

At first it doesn't seem so bad: true, all your things are searched and censored when you arrive and the headmistress can give you a harsh beating if you speak against it, but the rest looks like a normal if strict girls' school, and the girls aren't overloaded with work and have enough time to rest and walk in the park. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then the heroine learns that it is a place governed by an ancient alchemist where once in a while he picks girls to sacrifice so that he could retain his immortality</span>.

Going by the name Miss Magister, she takes over Saxon Heights by using hypnosis on the faculty, and from there forces all the girls to dress like her at all times, sends the prefects to London for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E6TheKingsDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E6TheKingsDemons">"something about inspecting the copies of Magna Carta..."</a>, and seizes all the girls' smartphones and tablets — ostensibly so they'll stop wasting time "SnapBooking and FaceChatting" but really to assemble a transmitter for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> summoning a Daemon! UNIT stops her before that happens — and before she kills a girl who was disobedient — but she gets away to scheme another day, of course</span>.
</li><li> <em>The Stolen Spring</em> by Hans Scherfig, has a quite straight example, set in a pre-war Danish society. The boys are regularly bullied by the teachers, and they bully back on eachother and on other teachers. No wonder the whole story centers around the pupil who eventually ended up killing the most hated teacher of them all.
</li><li> In <em>The Penderwicks,</em> Jeffrey's mother Mrs. Tifton wants to send him to the extremely strict Pencey Military Academy so he can be like his grandfather, a famous general, but Jeffrey wants to be a musician and study at a music conservatory.

More horrifyingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the school administration covers up the rape of a student by a teacher that led to the student's suicide, and the teacher gets away with no punishment.</span>
</li><li> In the novels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LidiaCharskaya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LidiaCharskaya">Lidia Charskaya</a>, boarding schools are often a nightmare for newcomers (students <em>and</em> teachers alike), with severe bullying and unfair punishments.

It's run by a psychotic maniac who enjoys beating students senseless for violating the school's many ludicrous rules, and that's if he's feeling <em>nice</em> (if not, they're just taken outside and shot). Meals are infrequent, since he's too much of a tight-fisted bastard to bother getting food, so students must spend meal times convincingly miming their meals, or they'll be beaten. They're also forced to work in the mines beneath the school, watched over by hussars in case anyone tries to escape.

<ul><li> Sokolov Academy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BadMoonRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BadMoonRising">Bad Moon Rising</a></em> more than qualifies for both students and staff. Deformed werewolves lived in the basement, multiple teachers used their positions to sexually abuse their students, children were used as hostages against their parents, and every headmaster the school ever had met a grisly, violent end at the hands of a student.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NoNamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NoNamed">NoNamed</a></em> is set in a school described to be this, though at first the rules seem relatively lax in some respects and it looks like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It isn't. The school is under the control of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, and what you have to beware of is the <em>other students</em>, who he controls.</span>
</li><li> The School of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StrangeSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StrangeSchool">Strange School</a></em> definitely qualifies. They kidnap children from Earth, outfit them with robot bodies in a factory, then force them to go through school lessons without sleep, and when graduation comes, they're killed off by the Principal.

<ul><li> <em>Grave Academy's</em> students and protagonists are all monsters, and all are at least Deuteragonists.
</li><li> The protagonist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RedRover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RedRover">Red Rover</a> arrives as a new hire at a boarding school, only to find out the hard way that it's the site of massacre and haunted by all sorts of storybook monsters.

</li><li> In the flash series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Xin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Xin">Xin</a>, the story takes place during a fictional time in America where, in an effort to prevent street gangs and violent delinquent crimes, the punishments of suspension and expulsion have been made illegal in all schools (not just boarding ones). Instead, corporal punishment has been reinstated, and as you may have guessed, it doesn't take long for staff to start abusing these powers. However, due to falling academic standards, along with rigorous school evaluations, a new system needed to be created. This lead to the hierarchy system known as the Pillar System, created by the main antagonist. The Pillar System takes advantage of the existing student hierarchy, and gives a select group of students, called monitors, complete power in setting rules and administering punishment to students. This goes about as well as you'd think. It's made worse by the fact that many main characters (including the top monitors) in the series know some insane superhuman fighting techniques (the series <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">animesque</a>). You also know a system is bad when you find yourself cheering for the delinquents who are trying to expose and break it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Addergoole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Addergoole">Addergoole</a> is a boarding school for faeries who've been raised human. There's mind control built into the walls. Slavery and rape are encouraged. The older kids are geased to not tell the new kids anything until it's too late. A lot of them don't want to warn them anyway. The whole school is a training version of their society.
</li><li> St. Adelaide's in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/EdeValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/EdeValley">Ede Valley</a></em> is this in a nutshell.

Although that was <em>mostly</em> a subversion: the school itself was fairly decent (the principal even seemed a fair and friendly man) and the only abuse we see was focused on Bart and Lisa (later only Lisa), and was based on other students resenting Lisa for being the first and only girl admitted to the school. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Then</a></em> they end their stay with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">Death Course</a> that's getting retired at the end of the year due to silly things like "students dying".

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomTroops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomTroops">Doom Troops</a> that are sent after runaways suggest its reputation is pretty well-deserved. In the aptly-named episode "St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses", the place turns out to be just as bad as Star imagined, if not worse. The Headmistress, Miss Heinous, is a cruel taskmistress who makes a fortune <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">breaking down</a> her wards and brainwashing them into being bland, obedient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic">Princess Classic</a> types.

In fact, his subplot in <em>Is It College Yet</em> is him trying to convince her not to go to military school (which she never wanted to do in the first place).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a> attended several boarding schools in his youth, almost all of which were horribly traumatic experiences.
