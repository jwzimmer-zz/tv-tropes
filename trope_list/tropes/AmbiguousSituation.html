<div class="indent">â€” <strong>Buffalo Springfield</strong>, "For What It's Worth"
</div></div><p>A certain situation is so ambiguous that the viewers/readers can't know for sure what's going on.
</p><p>While this trope can come into play unintentionally, for example as a side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">Faux Symbolism</a>, it's normally intentionally played by the authors. This can be done to make the story more interesting in general, as a way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>, or simply to appeal to several audiences at the same timeâ€”each of them likely to interpret the situation in whatever way they are most familiar with. Either some vital piece of information is missing, or we are left with contradicting information and no definite verification about what is correct and what is not.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>When <em>played straight</em>, the characters probably (but not necessarily) know what they are talking about, but they're not giving the audience all the information needed to know the situation for sure.
</p><p>When <em>invoked</em> or <em>debated</em>, the characters themselves ponder the nature of the situation they are in. This only applies to cases where they don't know that the trope isâ€”say for example that they are having a strong emotional reaction and are pondering whether it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>. In a detective story, the detectives might be unsure or disagreeingâ€”not merely about whether or not a certain suspect is guilty or not as a simple "who did this" level, but about the the basic nature of the situation they are investigating. Note that examples only count if the uncertainty is left unresolved: Brief uncertainties stop being this trope when they get a definite answer.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">Creepypastas</a> use this frequently, usually to make the stories seem scarier. As a result, many monstrous beings or occurrences are never given definite origins, motives or explanations. Many people have made Creepypastas that are fan interpretations explaining more, but, as they're just fan made, it's hard to come up with a definite canon.
</p><p>Only add examples where the alternatives are reasonable. If needed, make an argument for why it's a viable interpretation. Also, don't add situations that are only temporarily ambiguous: If the situation is clarified after a little while then it is not an example.
</p><p>Please note that pretty much ANY situation in fiction can theoretically be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Sarcasm Mode</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman">Devilman</a></em>: In <em>Devilman vs Hades</em>, a large portion of the story is focused on the revival of two women the hero and the villain dearly love. For Akira it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Miki, who is still dead from the events of the original manga</span>, and for Hades it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Persephone, his wife from Greek mythology, who Akira killed when he came to save Miki's soul.</span> Hades having power over the dead, promises Akira that he could bring the woman he loves back from the dead; given certain conditions are met. Ironically, despite having mastery over death, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Akira's Devilman powers have corrupted Persephone's soul, and has made it near impossible to repair.</span> The final scene of the manga leaves it ambiguous as to which of the two women were revived, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> either Miki or Persephone's eyes open up as Akira and Hades fight to the death. Making it even more ambiguous, is the fact that Persephone and Miki have different colored eyebrows, and that is obscured from view, making it impossible to tell which one of them is being revived.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>
<ul><li> At the end of the first season (which in chronological order would be the sixth episode), it is left very vague as to whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haruhi recreated the world or not</span>. Kyon and Koizumi don't know either. There is really no way to know for sure, only that the events surrounding the moment when it would have occurred, if it did, really did happen.
</li><li> Multiple explanations for various happenings are also presented. For example, Koizumi claims that Haruhi created the espers and either attracted time travelers and aliens or created them, while Mikuru says that Koizumi is lying and that the residents of the future have their own goals. Nagato refuses to say what the IDTE thinks because neither she nor the previous two have the slightest bit of proof that they can show to Kyon and any of the three could easily lie to him. And, of course, any of the three could just be <em>wrong</em>.
</li><li> Another big ambiguity that is touched on occasionally but never truly addressed is whether Haruhi is a god or not. It's one of the early theories that Koizumi presented, and a large number of fans assume it to be the case, but even Koizumi himself doesn't know if it's true or not. He says it's just the worst case scenario that his Organization is acting on. Or at least that he <em>claims</em> it is acting on.

The entire story is ambiguous; Twilight realizes that a number of coincidental characteristics of Fluttershy (the Stare, surrounding herself with creatures which love her) are consistent with Fluttershy being a changeling. When Twilight acts in a threatening manner, Fluttershy stares at Twilight, raising the question of whether or not Fluttershy used the Stare on her friend to make her back off. But when Twilight responds that it wouldn't matter, Fluttershy denies being a changeling. Was she telling the truth? Was she scared off of telling the truth by Twilight's negative reaction?

</li><li> What exactly does the black liquid do? Does it simply induce psychedelic experiences, psychic powers, and mutations? Is it a gateway into another realm of reality, where malevolent entities exist? Barry claims that he saw the "eye of God" during his 1966 psychedelic experience, which could have been a drug-induced delusion, an encounter with an eldritch entity, or an encounter with the divine, which would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">terrifying implications</a> for the world in which the movie takes place.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a></em> is an interesting example of this. The film acts as a deconstruction of giant monster movies, showing what it would be like to be a civilian in a giant monster attack. As such the monster's origin is left almost completely ambiguous because the characters themselves have no idea where it came from. The only thing that comes close to giving an idea about where the monster comes from is the ending which shows a large object falling from the sky into the ocean far off in the background. The fans and theorists are torn as to whether the object is the monster falling from space (meaning the creature would be an alien) or a piece of space junk, like a satellite, falling into the ocean and waking up the monster (which means the creature is an at least partially natural creature). Both explanations just raise more questions. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCloverfieldParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCloverfieldParadox">The Cloverfield Paradox</a></em> implies that the arrival of the monsters had something to do with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the experiments being done with parallel universes that caused the movie's own weirdness</span>, but even then it's not really made clear.

You're left never really knowing if the priest is actually guilty of the allegations.

Elliott, who was psychically linked to ET, speculates that ET is dying and would die if he didn't return home and that, because of the link, he is also dying, but it's never revealed if his hypothesis is correct. Also, it's unknown if the symptoms are because the air is bad for ET's species, he's getting the wrong food, he's not getting <em>enough</em> food, he has an actual disease, or if his species needs to be physically near each other to survive.

For example, one story is about how humans have developed technology that allows them to see into hell, which appears as a pleasant beach resort. A demon tells the narrator that, although they were instructed by God to torment sinners, the inherent nature of demons is to rebel against divine authority, so hell is in fact a nice place.

It's referred to as a "big problem", but what sort of big problem is left unsaid.

Basically, what really happened with, say, Aries' recruitment? Did Ruphas Mafahl find a legendary but weak sheep monster and teach it to stand up for itself before adopting it or did a random Japanese teenager find a rare spawn monster that just sat around looking dopey until he started taming it, causing it to ineffectually attack him once before submitting?

When Maeve visits her ex for emotional support after the Flight 37 incident, she angrily tells Maeve to "go back to Homelander" in a tone which implies adultery is at play. Maeve's ex later notes that Maeve was always afraid to be seen with her, indicating a lack of willingness or ability to come out.

However, the brief glimpse we see of that time makes it seem like she was <em>way</em> more into him than the other way around. But that scene was the one in which he broke up with her, so it's entirely possible he did genuinely really care about her before that. Even after they revisit the summer camp later in the season, we get no more flashbacks, and what happens in the present doesn't clarify much (Rebecca recites a very corny love note she wrote at the time; he finds it hilarious how melodramatic it is, leaving it unclear whether he ever wrote anything like that), so it's left permanently ambiguous whether she was projecting onto him back then, too.

The use of surnames and the ability of noblewomen to retain their maiden name after marriage was established within the show in Seasons 1-3 and by discussions with writers, but there's no agreement in-universe on what Sansa's surname currently is. Jaime considers her as Sansa Lannister in Season 4 while, in Season 6, a Bolton soldier trying to capture her calls her Lady Bolton. Later, Lyanna Mormont hangs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshade</a> by noting whether she is a Lannister or Bolton, while Sansa calls herself Sansa Stark, despite being legally married. In keeping with the series' themes, each person largely uses whatever name most suits their own position. The legitimacy of her second marriage is a second issue, since Sansa was married to Tyrion Lannister before a large crowd and officiated by the High Septon, while the second marriage is conducted before an Old Gods ceremony. In the books, Sansa's marriage to Tyrion is voidable but not void and requires a formal annulment; Littlefinger claims in the show that no annulment is necessary. Some fans believe otherwise since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">this is Littlefinger</a>, but nothing else has been said on the subject.

It's possible Lieutenant Hornblower, Lieutenant Kennedy, or Midshipman Wellard pushed him, or that the disoriented and paranoid Captain simply tripped and fell on his own. The scene is shot so as to be intentionally vague, and by the end of the miniseries, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kennedy, Wellard, and Sawyer are all dead</span>.

<ul><li> The folk song "Blue Tailed Fly" is about a slave owner dying from being bitten by an insect, but the line in the chorus about "Jimmy crack corn and I don't care" is a bit confusing:
<ul><li> The most common interpretation is that a man named Jimmy is cracking (milling) corn to turn it into hominy or liquor, but some people think it comes from "gimcrack" meaning useless, so he doesn't care about his corn, or possibly his liquor, since "corn" was slang for liquor in the past. It could also be interpreted as Jim being the master and cracking his "corn" (skull), it being slang for gossiping, a corruption of "gimme cracked corn", or a euphemism for Jim Crow or Jesus Christ.
</li><li> If Jimmy really is cracking corn, is he a separate guy, or is the slave speaking in third person?
</li><li> Is the slave mourning or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">celebrating</a> his master's death?

This character could be a powerful human, since "angel" is a common metaphor for generic benevolence. The character could also be a powerful vampire, since most of the songs from the same band are about vampires and they routinely use "angel" as a euphemism for "vampire" or "lover".

The only hint of who he may be, is John commenting that he looks familiar and he himself has a good memory, to which the stranger mentions a woman that was killed during John's criminal days, that John doesn't remember and says "If you don't remember her, why would you remember me." and that <strong>every</strong> man must face his past said at another point. And though he gives a couple missions to test John's morality, he doesn't seem to react strongly to either decision. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Fan theories have come up with</a>, everything from him being anything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil">The Devil</a>, a manifestation of John's subconscious, John's long lost father, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianAngel">Guardian Angel</a>, to the spirit of an innocent bystander who was killed in the crossfire of one of John's criminal escapades.

</li><li> He's made even more ambiguous in <em>II</em>. In the main story, you can find a shack in the swamp where thereÂ’s an unfinished painting of the Strange Man and cryptic writings on the wall. The writings hint about things youÂ’ve done thus far but also things like a cholera outbreak in the state most of <em>I</em> takes place in but you canÂ’t yet get to in <em>II</em>. ThereÂ’s also a map of a town from <em> I</em> with a note that reads "I offered you happiness or two generations. You made your choice." That could be about Arthur, John, or a man named Hebert Moon, all of whom lost children. Arthur had a son who died in a robbery, John lost a daughter to a fever, and Hebert disowned his daughter for marrying a Jewish man. It could be a reference to all three of them. You can talk to a stranger in New Austin (the state where the first game takes place) who tells you that he ran into someone fitting his description whom he believed to be the Grim Reaper that put a curse on the nearby town. You can find a picture of him in a store run by Herbert Moon in said town. He says that itÂ’s a picture that someone gave him. He likes it so he kept it. Herbert is implied to be immune to the ongoing cholera outbreak, and if you shoot him in the head he'll be right back with nothing to show for it but a bandage. It seems like some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>. Once you come back to the shack in the epilogue <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as John</span>, the painting will begin to finish itself. Once it finishes, the man will be seen in the mirror standing behind you.There's a blind old seer you can find that will give very accurate prophecies that tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">John</span> even he doesn't know what the man wants with him nor does he know if "he's of this world". The same major theories remain but this game adds more of a supernatural element to him. The only main theory that gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> is the one about him being a manifestation of John's subconscious.
</li></ul></li><li> The motivation behind many actions taken by Dutch van der Linde in <em>II</em>, particularly near the end of the game, are heavily debated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He starts taking increasingly violent and questionable actions by Chapter 4. By the end of Chapter 6, he leaves Arthur Morgan to die in an oil refinery, leaves John Marston to die in a train heist soon after, and denies doing either when he's confronted. What makes these scenarios ambiguous is how much Micah Bell has a role in influencing Dutch's decisions to do any of this, and whether or not Dutch's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">mental state is so poor</a> that Micah was able to encourage him to do the most amoral things he's done. It's possible that Dutch views his gang as ultimately expendable, but there are indications that he abandons Arthur and John because Micah has successfully convinced him (as well as Javier Escuella and Bill Williamson) that they're informants of the Pinkertons, and thus the biggest dangers to the gang.</span>
</li><li> There's also the question of why Dutch <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is in Micah's camp in the epilogue, and why he decides to shoot him and spare John. When John asks why he's there, he simply replies "Same as you, I suppose." This could suggest he also came with the intent to kill Micah, but this could suggest he's there for the money from the Blackwater ferry heist. He and Micah are both pointing his gun at John in a Mexican standoff, and will actually shoot John if the player makes him shoot Micah. He walks away from the site after shooting Micah, not explaining his reasoning</span>.

<ul><li> In "Slumber Party", we never find out if Tommy is hallucinating or dreaming.
</li><li> In one episode, Charlotte believes she's pregnant at the start only to end the episode by stating she isn't. It's never clarified what occurred. Did she jump to conclusions, get a false reading, miscarry, have an abortion, or what?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Hurricane Neddy", Ned Flanders yells at a bunch of citizens, then calls Homer the worst human he's met but not yelling. Homer claims he "got off pretty easily". Either Homer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">doesn't realise that Ned was being so rude because he's stupid</a> or he did realise but was just glad he wasn't yelled at.
</li><li> Another thing about Ned Flanders is why he talks the way he does (saying nonsense words like "diddly" and "okely-dokely"). In the "Hurricane Neddy" episode, the therapist thinks it was because of him suppressing his anger towards his parents because both the suppression and the nonsense talk started around the same time. Then again, he still talks that way after getting treatment for the suppression, he's been heard talking that way when he clearly isn't angry (in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTicked">sometimes not talking that way is a sign he's angry</a>), and perhaps most perplexing of all, some of his relatives, even those in other countries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedFamilyQuirks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedFamilyQuirks">also talk that way</a>.
</li><li> In "Skinner and the Superintendent", Skinner burns his roast, claims the smoke is steam from the "steamed clams", then buys some hamburgers and pretends he cooked them, covering his tracks by claiming that in Albany, they call hamburgers "steamed <em>hams</em>". At the end of the skit, Chalmers tells Skinner that he is "an odd fellow", but admittedly "steam[s] a good ham". It is unclear whether this is a sign he actually believes the lie, he is simply humouring Skinner, or he is subtly mocking Skinner.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode "Toy Store of Doom", Spongebob and Patrick act scared of a shadow. It turns out to be of a little toy robot, but they still act scared of the robot. The episode never makes it clear whether they are playing pretend or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">actually think it's dangerous</a>.
