Fortunately the first two times he did that, the city was already evacuated.
<ul><li> Toward the end of the Female Titan Arc, Erwin Smith and the Survey Corps corner the suspected female titan shifter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Annie Leonhardt</span>, to the Stohess district of Wall Sina.

However, since Guts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying">hunts apostles</a>, he takes it upon himself to kill them, which should make him a hero... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">but he does his deeds at the expense of everybody around him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">and for his own desires</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">and he knows it.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Thus,</a> Guts is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">viewed as a villain</a> by most who come across him.
</li><li> Roger Smith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>. His primary weapon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, and the setting is a city. Said giant robot also travels via underground rail system and causes massive damage to roads and buildings <em>just by appearing</em>. Every episode inevitably features an enemy which only The Big O can defeat. The Military Police Major Dastun understandably isn't particularly happy whenever the Big shows up, though he realizes that it's also the only thing that can save the day.
</li><li> Generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, where the Gotei 13 use barriers (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in one case, replacing an entire town with a replica of it specifically for fighting in</span>) and their ability to stand on air in order to have their battles high enough that nothing will get too damaged in the fight. Played so straight with Komamura whose fight with Poww results in as much damage to the real town they're protecting as the fake one they're fighting in that even his allies comment on how much that'll cost Squad 7 after the fight is over.
<ul><li> Hitsugaya reveals that Komamura personally pays for any collateral damage he or his subordinates cause An after chapter omake drawing in the volume the fight was published in reveals that apparently it costs him enough that he'll only be able to feed his pet dog, Goro, okara (soy pulp) for the month.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the preview for episode 340. Iba grows concerned about Komamura's use of Bankai, as it could end up exhausting 7th Division's repair budget. Made worse by the fact that since Komamura's bankai draws the most attention, the other Divisions will blame 7th division for ALL of the damage caused by the battles with the reigai, causing Komamura to grow concerned as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Heavily deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, where the heroes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, along with their opponents, are so powerful that their battles can cause thousands of civilian casualties if they don't take extreme caution. The pilots soon learn to fight in evacuated or unpopulated areas to limit the damage, but even then they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fighting in other worlds; then again, the damage they wreak then will pale compared to what'll happen to the place once they win—<em>the entire reality disappears!</em></span>. The populace initially has no way of telling that the heroes are even fighting for the Earth, and commonly refer to the mecha as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a>. Some foreign governments are so afraid that they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">send assassins against the pilots</span>.
</li><li> Kuroneko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BrynhildrInTheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BrynhildrInTheDarkness">Brynhildr in the Darkness</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">"magical" powers</a> to fight against opponents. Since their forces are constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">causing explosions</a>, each of their fights causes great damage to their property. And not just in the fighting. She also lets something explode around her when she sees a girl getting too close to the boy she loves.
</li><li> Kazuki's efforts to get to the roof of his school to stop Victor's resurrection at the end of the LXE arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> cause more property damage than the LXE did in the <em>entire story arc</em>. And to top it off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kazuki's transformation into Victor III makes him inadvertently do as much harm to his classmates as Victor did once he woke up</span>. At least he was able to prevent any actual (civilian) deaths...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Campione" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Campione">Campione!</a></em>, whenever there's a historical monument present in the area, you can be sure that Godou will use The Boar to destroy the landmark even if he really doesn't want it happening. His first battle in the original novel ended with him destroying the Colosseum, and it was just a <em>sparring match</em>.
<ul><li> Justified in that he needs to target something weighing several tons to invoke the Boar and his enemies are usually too small for that, so he chooses nearby landmarks instead. He'd stop the Boar if he could, but it just ignores him.
</li><li> Even without invoking the Boar, Godou is a hazard. The Tokyo Tower was destroyed by a lightning fight he had with another Campione and Godou personally tore pillars off the façade of a landmark to use as oversized mallets against a god.
</li><li> John Pluto Smith fights to protect the people of Los Angeles but requires "sacrifices" to activate some of her Authorities. Relevant to this trope is that she requires the destruction of a large man-made structure to activate her Archmage Authority.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion">Cannon God Exaxxion</a></em> is so huge it causes massive property damage every time it takes a step. And let's not even get into the shockwave created by the damn thing's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a>. In fact, one of the major themes of the series is the stunning amount of collateral damage caused by the hero (despite his attempts to avoid or reduce it), the enemy trying to take him and his mecha down, and their reprisals against anyone they <em>think</em> might be supporting him. Just <em>knowing</em> him, or being in the same part of the city when there's a battle, is dangerous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork">Cells at Work!</a></em>: Medications are depicted this way to represent harmful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude">side effects</a>. For example, the Steroid that shows up to stop the allergic reaction is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> that attacks cells indiscriminately and causes a lot of property damage.
</li><li> Misaka Mikoto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em> often fights this way. Their special ability is attacks with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">electricity</a>, and if they get into fierce fighting, can be quite serious damage the result.

When a government weasel decides to turn Earth into a refuge for reformed intergalactic criminals and Sadamitsu tries to call him on it, he's very well put down with the fact that "the rest of us can't afford to run around with a robot head destroying the entire planet... you... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">destroyer</a>".

The most famous incident is the first episode of the anime, in which a village is being attacked by a dragon Lina accidentally set loose by slaughtering/robbing the gang of bandits that it belonged to. Lina first makes the village elder promise to pay her before lifting a finger to help, then destroys the whole village along with the dragon because the dragon insults her by <em>not</em> stepping on her.

He eventually gets declared to be "the first human Act of God" because wherever he goes, things get wrecked.
<ul><li> In the manga, he eventually gets dubbed "God's armed arm" in the aftermath of a particularly spectacular catastrophe. That's right, it's so bad he's considered the instrument of divine retribution (Though, in all honesty, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was because of his brother Knives</span>.) The best part, and a good bit of the comedy early on in the series, revolves around the fact that Vash is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a>, and things are wrecked by people gunning for him. His introduction into the series involves him sitting down to a bar and a hail of bullets completely and utterly destroying the entire building, save the stool he happened to be sitting on.

He put a hole in THE MOON while trying to stop Knives (Which also happened to be Knives' fault).

</li><li> Dying alien warrior Prince Elfangor, one of the technologically-advanced Andalites, reveals a covert invasion of Earth by another alien species, the Yeerks, to five human teenagers. He gives the teenagers access to morphing technology in hopes that they can launch a guerrilla war against the invaders, promising that Andalite reinforcements are on their way, and they wouldn't need to stall for time more than a year. The teenagers, becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a>, end up fighting for three years, because the Andalite military that the Animorphs were so desperately waiting for deemed Earth a low priority, and assumed the kids were lying to try to become a high priority in the very few times the two groups were able to make contact. When the Andalites realized that they've made a mistake and the Yeerk invasion on Earth has turned into a full-blown war, they decide to forfeit Earth and let the Yeerks concentrate all their manpower on Earth...before they blast the entire planet from orbit, killing everyone there, Yeerk...or human. This really is something of an indicator of Andalite arrogance, who believe humans to be second-rate species.
<ul><li> The Animorphs themselves engage in more than one instance of the trope, especially towards the end, but their biggest application is in support of the Andalite defense of the planet Leera. They end up being the lynchpin in a plan to take out all the Yeerks landing on the planets only continent by... blowing it up. The Leerans, being amphibious and having built all their infrastructure underwater, are willing to make the sacrifice, but that's a pretty big bang.
</li><li> When the Yeerks invade the Hork-Bajir planet, the Andalites send only minimal reinforcements (again, they didn't believe the warning that they got, this time due to age and gender discrimination). When it's becoming clear that the Yeerks are winning and reinforcements can't arrive in time, Alloran creates a quantum virus that will kill every Hork-Bajir on the planet, in order to make sure that a minimum number of Hork-Bajir can be used as hosts. He does become a pariah and loathes himself, but that doesn't help the Hork-Bajir who afterwards number in the tens of thousands.
</li><li> Eventually averted in the last book. Prior to the last book, Ax notes that the prolonged war against the Yeerks has given the Andalite military command more power than they rightly should have, and they no longer properly represent the will of the people as they're supposed to. This comes to be proven true in the last book, when Ax invokes his legal right to challenge the decision of Andalite Captain-Prince Asculan regarding Jake's promise to Yeerk prisoners on Earth, by which Ax's challenge would be tried before a civil court as opposed to a military one. It is heavily implied that the civil government and the people are surprisingly supportive of the human victory; Prince Asculan is forced to consult with his political advisors, and, realizing that he doesn't stand much of a chance in a civil trial, Asculan begrudgingly bows to Jake's wishes.

To quote the Dresden Files RPG, which uses Harry as an example of how to create a character: "Jim wants to make a wizard who specializes in throwing around fire and is extra hard on locations due to property damage. These ideas make him think of Dresden in World War II, when it got bombed to hell and gone." Some examples:
<ul><li> The foreword for one short story in the <em>Side Jobs</em> compilation notes that a part of the planning process was finding a nice mall in the Chicago area for Dresden to destroy. Needless to say, the place is on fire by the end of the piece.
</li><li> A non-exhaustive list of the destruction Harry has inflicted includes: wrecking an elevator (giant scorpion golem), burning down a townhouse (evil sorcerer drug ring), blowing a hole through three buildings (giant loup-garou), burning down a warehouse (vampire kidnappers), setting most of a mansion on fire (more vampires), rampant destruction in a Walmart (faerie assassins), setting fire to most of a floor on a high-rise (fallen angel terrorists), burning down a school (it wasn't <em>his</em> fault, it was those demon baboons with flaming poo), burning down a homeless shelter (more vampires!), massive damage to downtown Chicago (zombie tyrannosaur and necromancers), destroying an entire cavern complex (giant clusterfuck involving vampires, ghouls, evil sorcerers, and C4-packing mercenaries and gangsters), the walls of a business tower, the front end of a townhouse, most of a subway station, and the Shedd Aquariam's Oceanarium exhibit (faerie hitmen and more fallen angels). <em>Changes</em> takes this even further, with an entire building being blown up (they said they were cleaning out asbestos....) and the finale involving leveling most of a pyramid.
</li><li> The very first time Harry ever fought anything with magic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">He Who Walks Behind</a>) he ended up blowing up a gas station.

Some blame can be placed on Lexx himself, as the ship does not have a very good grasp on ethics or even basic slang, not to mention that it <em>likes</em> to blow up planets.

Later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> series began to use clear areas for the Zord battles.

However, when the Rangers are in town, you can expect a good deal of town to get demolished. It seemed to steadily increase until 9/11 happened, at which point building destruction became vanishingly rare and is only recently beginning to creep back in. Naturally, most of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding">Conveniently Empty Buildings</a> (though pre-9/11, they didn't feel the need to tell us that.)

"Why are you cheering?! Your town is in ruins!"
</li><li> However, while it <em>usually</em> isn't the Rangers' fault, it sometimes totally is. Just to name a few:
<ul><li> In an early <em>Time Force</em> episode, a monster throws about half a building at the Megazord. Instead of catching it and gently putting it down, the Megazord uses its shield to smash it to pebbles.
</li><li> In <em>Jungle Fury,</em> the last round with Grizzaka involves the Megazord putting him through a whole line of buildings.
</li><li> Once in <em>Operation Overdrive,</em> the Megazord finisher plows straight at a monster... who dodges. Directly in the blast's path is a building behind where the monster had been standing. The camera cuts away <em>just</em> before we'd have seen our heroes atomize it, but it's not like anything could have stopped the blast in the inches it had to go. Nope, that building's toast.
</li><li> In the first Megazord battles in <em>Samurai,</em> it's a sword slash the monster dodges. We <em>do</em> get to see the Rangers accidentally slice the building behind it in half this time. Mike (Green) quips that he hopes it was insured. (Not long before that, the Rangers in the Megazord also ducked a slice from the monster that went on to destroy a building instead of blocking it.) However, they can be forgiven because it <em>was</em> their first Megazord fight.

Particularly in the revival series. Sometimes, the Doctor comes into a situation, and while a bit of kerfuffle occurs with the local area, it's hardly damaging enough to be more than a problem for the Doctor to fix, with any lives lost and property damage really just being the fault of the villains. But other times, the Doctor enters a situation, and it's the simple fact that he's there at all that things ended up with innocent people dying and light to heavy collateral damage that will affect lives at the time and lives to come. This is never lost on the Doctor, thankfully, even if he doesn't stay around long enough to see the results of his presence (though chances are he ends up finding out about it, if not visiting it at some future point to see how things are going).

<ul><li> An interesting variation by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Christian savior</a>, Jesus Christ. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> had said that he had "come not to bring peace, but to bring a sword." This is often interpreted to mean that those who accept Jesus will bring conflict and division to his surroundings. However, it's implied that those who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouTriedNotBeingAMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouTriedNotBeingAMonster">refuse to accept converted family members</a> into the fold are primarily responsible for the suffering that happens when divisions pop up.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monsterpocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monsterpocalypse">Monsterpocalypse</a></em>, the faction called G.U.A.R.D. are UN troops who ride around in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> to defend the world's cities from devastation by giant monsters. Needless to say, given how the game works, they knock down just as many buildings as the freaks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> tends to have characters that do this quite often. In one example, a high level cleric summons two elder earth elementals to fight off the bandits attacking them in the night. On the second floor of an inn. Then blamed the collapse of the building on the bandits when the town guard showed up.
<ul><li> A number of spells usable by player characters can lead to this trope. A few examples include: Meteor Storm, Tsunami, Earthquake, Wish, Alter Reality, the Mordenkainen spells, Colossus, any of the higher level Monster Summoning spells, Crushing Fist of Spite, a well placed Fireball, Creeping Doom, Summon Weather, Gate, etc. Honestly there are too many to name. The more powerful a magic-using PC gets, the more the potential for this trope increases. Keep in mind, this applies to Psionicists and reckless artifact/relic users, also.
</li><li> This is set up in the adventure module <em>Apocalypse Stone</em>. The player characters are unknowingly being tested by a divine agent, and their current test is one of generosity. They are given the possibility to donate magic items to renew enchantments that protect a village from a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The arguably closest-to-good guys in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. The Imperium has been known to 'save' cities from zombies or aliens by knocking half of it down with artillery and setting the other half on fire.
<ul><li> it's almost deemed standard operating procedure for an Imperial Crusade Force to launch an <a class="urllink" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Exterminatus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a protocol in which ships destroy a planet (or at the very least, just the entire population) with nightmarish weapons of mass destruction, on planets deemed lost to Aliens/Heretics/Something far more worse. The purpose of this single most destructive act is to <em>hope</em> that such destruction of a lost planet will keep a sector of Imperial Space safer.
</li><li> In the words of a man who was unfortunate enough to be on a planet that needed Space Marine assistance, "We used to pray to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">the Emperor</a> to send his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Angels</a> to deliver us.

Combat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> tends to burn a lot of Essence. One of the Dragon-Blood aspects is Fire. Suffice to say there's a reason that Dragon-Blood construction favours stone instead of wood.
<ul><li> Then there are the renegade Abyssals, whose efforts to protect locations have to include leaving <em>really quickly</em> to avoid wiping out the town in a colossal Resonance eruption.
</li><li> In the First Age, if there were problems in the Underworld a team of Solars would arrive and solve the problem and get back before dinner... unless the residents of the Underworld were unlucky, in which case the Solars would blast the problem to smithereens and go home in time for lunch.
</li></ul></li><li> The Fate adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a></em> has collateral consequences, which allow players to bleed off damage by throwing the surrounding area into chaos (the example given in the book involves failing to stop a rampaging Futuresaurus); the lower ones go away if you take steps to get it back under control, while the high-intensity ones are there until the end of the story arc. Another Fate adaptation, this time of the old True20 <em>Mecha vs Kaiju</em> setting, has a different spin on this: the collateral consequences are under the control of the monsters, not the players, meaning that attempting to stop the giant monsters is almost guaranteed to cause thematically appropriate mayhem - it is, after all, tradition for the giant monster fights to flatten cities.
</li><li> Wild magicians from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> are also prone to it sometimes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is pretty explicit about this being the case if the choice is made to fight in a city. Just walking down the streets in your Battlemech is enough to inflict substantial damage, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding">Conveniently Empty Building</a> is <em>not</em> in effect most of the time. In general, when a defending force chooses to fight in a city, it means they're either desperate or don't care about civilians. Or both.

His list of destructive deeds include derailing a train, burning down a medical facility, causing the collapse of medical regulations, throwing transportation in London into chaos and under the thumb of gangs, crashing a carriage, and most famously, nearly collapsing the British economy just by killing the bank president and causing it to close temporarily.

Also, as Mario points out in one of the early cutscenes, where the rebels are at the moment, a few blown up water towers are far less important that showing the people of Medici that it <em>is</em> possible to strike at Di Ravello in meaningful ways and survive.

The surviving soldiers are at war with the CIA and both sides use murder and torture to further their ends. In response to this, Captain Martin Walker (protagonist) hardens his resolve to fix the situation, only worsening it with every bullet fired, explosion caused and war crime he commits until by the end, he's damned the city to death by dehydration</span>.

Be it natural formations that took aeons to form, Japanese WW-II-bunkers, Soviet installations or ancient ruins that have weathered the passage of countless centuries, almost all of them will inevitably crumble into smoldering piles of rubble within minutes of her arrival on site. The amounts of infrastructure and irrecoverable historical legacy Lara routinely destroys on her adventures are staggering. Granted, much of it is caused by her enemies in their attempts to kill her, but another large chunk is definitely her own fault.
</li><li> Nathan Drake of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em> series is much akin to Ms. Croft, except some of the areas are mostly decrepit by their standards; and so are naturally decaying. Then again, he did manage to destroy a lost, legendary city with just three bullets.
</li><li> Every single time Wario saves some area/world in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand">Wario Land</a></em> series, it's pretty much this. At best the areas he visits end up completely cleaned out of money and with lots of scenery broken, at worst the entire level gets mostly smashed to pieces (see many stages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandII">Wario Land II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand3">Wario Land 3</a></em>) or the entire level/area gets literally blown to kingdom come (like the Golden Pyramid and a few of its levels in the fourth game). Still, he is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, and his games range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>, so it probably shouldn't be much of a surprise that he doesn't care how many pieces a level ends up in afterwards.

<div class="indent"><strong>Mr Toad:</strong> <em>[after Bigby has just accidentally destroyed his car]</em> I called you, and you came to help. I can't be mad. But even when you help, things end up more fucked than when they started!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict">World in Conflict</a></em> actually has you avoid that situation to a degree. In several cases, you have to deal with enemies under a time limit before command is forced to take drastic measures. Played straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cascade Falls getting nuked to stop the Russians</span>.
<ul><li> That being said, there aren't many cities that survive being saved by American forces. Even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seattle</span>, at the end of the game, will likely require billions upon billions of dollars to bring back to any semblance of normalcy.
</li></ul></li><li> Terror missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a></em>. You are to save cities (and, in TFTD, ships) from alien attack, but while the game punishes you for allowing (not to mention causing) civilian deaths, there is no penalty for destruction of property, so the cities you "save" from the alien menace are generally in ruins by the time your troops depart.
<ul><li> In the modern adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts">Xenonauts</a></em>, you actually are penalized if too much civilian property is destroyed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMApocalypse">Apocalypse</a></em>, X-Com is more <em>tolerated</em>, rather than embraced, and the city of Mega Primus is humanity's last bastion against a mostly ruined world. As per usual for X-Com, you can absolutely destroy the areas you deploy to, especially since a lot of structures are supported by lower levels which are easier to destroy and let gravity do the rest. However, causing insane amounts of damage will sour relations with the organization that owns the facility, and if you piss them off enough, X-Com won't just be fighting the aliens.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComEnemyUnknown">The reboot</a> continues this trope: your soldiers' default equipment includes a grenade, and heavies carry a <em>rocket launcher</em> that can be upgraded to a <em>plasma homing missile</em>. You can blow up entire buildings in your pursuit of alien activity, cars are casually used as IED's and you can opt to murder civilians to prevent Chryssalids from turning them into zombies. All the UFOs that you shoot down have significant chance to crash into urban areas and you see entire city blocks demolished by small craft. You can only imagine how their battleships would look in same situation. The end mission disables the alien mothership's safety protocols, turning his power core into miniature black hole. Being too close to Earth, the only thing that prevented planetary destruction was the Volunteer sacrificing his/her life to deal with this mess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> continues the destructive traditions of its predecessor, only now you can blow up floors of buildings to drop enemies to their doom, and one class, the Grenadier, is dedicated to property and cover destruction. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> you can unlock gives you the ability to fire rockets, and the SPARK robot allies you can build in the <em>Shen's Last Gift</em> expansion can as well. On top of that, unlike in previous games, civilian casualties in cities have no impact on your standing (you're a guerilla movement being smeared by propaganda anyway) so you're perfectly fine with accidentally getting a civilian or twenty caught in the crossfire. It's even encouraged in some cases, because a civilian might actually be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Faceless</a> in disguise!
</li></ul></li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> certainly qualifies as this to the extreme. The current incarnation, Fei, has been born and reborn several times throughout history. His original incarnation is not shown as being responsible for anything destructive, but his reincarnations? <em>Hoo boy</em>.
<ul><li> His first incarnation, Kim, is a researcher engaged in developing nanotechnology with the best of intentions in mind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kim's technology is rediscovered 6,000 years later and is instrumental in the development of nanotechnology which is utilized to revive Deus (and, consequently, wipe out most of the planet's population).</span>
</li><li> His second incarnation, Lacan, is a mild-mannered painter who becomes a hero in the struggle against Solaris for the freedom of surface-dwellers. This lasts only until the love of his life dies in a heroic sacrifice. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">particularly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">unfortunate</a> series of events resulting in Lacan becoming Grahf, who immediately summons ancient murder weapons known as Diabolos which end up killing off most of the planet's population. And that's just for starters.</span>
</li><li> Finally, there is Fei, a guy who generally augments his angst with a solid heroic archetype. But, if you stress him out too much, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he transforms into Id, a completely amoral monster and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a> who wipes out entire civilizations <em>just because</em></span>.

</li><li> One of the most-remembered episodes among fans of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> series involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">peacenick Autobot Beachcomber</a> stumbling across a strategic resource in an unspoiled meadow. Naturally, both sides end up completely laying waste to said meadow fighting over it. The final line of the episode is Beachcomber surveying the scene of devastation and declaring, heartbroken, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">We won.</a>"
<ul><li> It should probably be mentioned that the resource in question was a liquid that made a Transformer invincible to laser fire, to the point that even shots from Omega Supreme, a giant Autobot with a BFG for an arm, were totally ineffective. In addition, Beachcomber discovered the resource first but chose to hide his discovery from his comrades in the hopes of not turning the meadow into a battlefield. Understandable, but less forgivable is the fact that when the Decepticons discovered the resource independently and quickly used it to gain the advantage in battle, Beachcomber selfishly continued to keep quiet. It was only through the effort of other Autobots that they discovered the meadow and turned the tide. It apparently never occurred to Beachcomber that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Optimus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Prime</a> would have rather taken steps to safeguard both the resource <em>and</em> the meadow. Because of this, there are a number of fans who look upon Beachcomber as a coward, hypocrite and traitor for being willing to let his fellow Autobots die to preserve the meadow, and being too stupid to realise that if the Decepticons won, the entire planet would be strip-mined.
</li></ul></li><li> Bulkhead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> has this problem. Quite often, actually, as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">Does Not Know His Own Strength</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sari:</strong> I'm sure it wasn't that bad. You saved the city, right? <br/><strong>Bumblebee:</strong> After destroying half of it. <br/><strong>Sari:</strong> Not helping.
</div><ul><li> Of course, as the perspective Autobot team in <em>Animated</em> started as a repair crew, and the city of Detroit isn't exactly happy about the collateral damage, on more than one occasion they have forced the Autobots to clean up after themselves. Which is good, because even the live-action PG-13 movies don't feature as much destruction as <em>Animated.</em>
</li><li> Split down the middle with Omega Supreme. He views himself as a destructive menace, little better than the Decepticons he fought against. The Autobots see him as a mighty hero who secured their victory during the Great War.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a>,</em> Bulkhead is forever accidentally smashing sensitive equipment even if not in battle. Ratchet will always yell "Bulkhead! I needed that!"
</li><li> Addressed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, Nick Fury tells Spider-Man that he tends to cause too much collateral damage when fighting super villains; Nick is trying to train the team to do less property damage in their fights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog">Underdog</a></em> was once asked about the damages caused while he was taking out a bad guy. His response:
<div class="indent"><strong>Underdog:</strong> I am a hero who never fails. I cannot be bothered with such details.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> WWI saw widespread application, most famously on the Western front which cut a miles wide swathe mostly in the territory of the defending French for 4 years. Before/After photos of <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Passchendaele_aerial_view.jpg">Passchendaele<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> illustrate it fairly well. Many towns were literally wiped off the face of the Earth. A number of these "Lost towns" are listed on memorials to the war dead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> saw numerous examples, such as both Leningrad and Stalingrad, which were virtually levelled in their ultimately successful defenses.
<ul><li> Many of the great capitals of Europe, like Paris and Rome, escaped this sort of destructive fighting only because the German commanders quit them rather than engage in destructive fighting there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHomeFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHomeFront">London, not so much</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, upon fulfilling his pledge to return to the Philippines, expected the Japanese to do the same in Manilla, but instead they dug in and mounted a defensive resistance that was so difficult to break, MacArthur was forced to lift his ban on heavy artillery and air support. This decision allowed the US Army to eventually defeat the stubborn defenders while reducing American casualties, but at the cost of flattening most of Manila and its historical landmarks with tons of bombs and shells. <br/><br/>The reasons for this type of defense are many, but the primary reason to obliterate a city while defending it is not so much to deny the enemy the resources, but rather to slow the enemy down. Stalingrad, for example, held up the Germans for <em>months</em> as they tried to get enough forces through the ruined city. This is less common in modern warfare with precision weapons, but still occurs. Fallujah during the Iraq War, for example. <br/><br/>The battle of Stalingrad stands out because the German army was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forced to ignore</a> the strategy that had been winning the war before then, which saw tough pockets of defense surrounded and picked off at a leisurely pace to conserve men and munitions.
</li><li> The liberation of France involved blowing a lot of it up. Some residents of coastal towns bear a lot of resentment towards the D-Day invaders (in part due to the rapes and such that accompanied the liberation). Succinctly described by the anonymous member of Patton's Third Army who remarked of the smoking ruins of the French Village he occupied, "We sure liberated the hell out of this place."
</li></ul></li><li> The Battle of Mosul took 9 months to conclude in part to avoid wholesale application of the trope, but large sections were still leveled; among other things, pancaking one building even with modern bombs does nothing to help the buildings next to it.
</li><li> Referenced by image macros that use some variation of the phrase "we're gonna free the shit out of you," usually in reference to the US and over images of bombers or bombs.
</li><li> Termite Exterminators. They'll have to batter down huge wooden portions of an infested house and in extreme cases put the entire structure under a fumigation tent for days.
</li><li> In urban firefighting, tearing down buildings is an essential practice in the effort to prevent the spread of a fire through a city, which doesn't exactly enthuse the people whose buildings are chosen for demolition. Wildfire fighters take it to the next level with controlled burns, either to intentionally burn the fuel in an area to prevent buildup from fueling a devastating blaze, or when actively fighting a fire, to starve the main fire by burning fuel before it reaches an area.
</li><li> Police departments often limit the circumstances under which they will engage in vehicle chases to avoid dangerous driving and high speed crashes with bystanders. There's little point in running down someone for a warrant or fleeing if they hit a pedestrian in the process.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Nr31Lv6H8">In this video,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a Russian soldier retrieves a cat up a tree by cutting down the tree, crashing it into power lines.
