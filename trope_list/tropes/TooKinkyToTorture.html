<ul><li> Creed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> of course. Train <em>tries</em> to beat it into Creed that he is <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> interested in the sword-wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>. The result? Train ends up unknowingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">spread-legged on top of Creed</a> and only realizes too late that Creed got a hard-on and even <em>orgasmed</em> from it all. Disgust and exasperation are pretty much what describe Train's reaction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS">Blend-S</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's fair to say many of Cafe Stile's customers are masochists.
<ul><li> When Maika heard that she'd be playing as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">sadist</a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosplayCafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosplayCafe">Cafe Stile</a>, she was puzzled as to why anyone would want to be treated like garbage by a waitress. Dino explained there're people who like that—and he's right. Moments later when Maika treated her first two customers that way (and completely accidentally!), those two customers are clearly quite happy with the experience.
</li><li> Maika accidentally uses salt, vinegar, and <em>tabasco sauce</em> in her dessert in the second episode of the anime. After she says it's her dessert, it becomes an instant hit with the masochist customers.
</li></ul></li><li> The cafe's owner Dino can count, but <em>only</em> if Maika's doing the abusing. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed">nosebled</a> a few times to it in the first episode, but in obvious pain when Mafuyu abuses her for his tardiness.
</li></ul></li><li> Kaoruko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ComicGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ComicGirls">Comic Girls</a></em> once told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Tsubasa</a> she wants to be scolded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotTeacher">Hot Teacher</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em>Played With</em> in the Pilaf Arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. When Bulma refuses to disclose the location of her dragon ball, Pilaf states that he will subject her to a "Humiliating Act" to break her, Bulma is clearly shaken by his words...until said "Humiliating Act" turns out to be blowing her a kiss. Pilaf is shocked she's unaffected by this, and Bulma, breathing a sigh of relief, states that she thought she was about to be stripped naked and fondled. The Pilaf Gang freak out at this, thinking she's a pervert who <em>wanted to them to sexually assault her</em>, they immediately throw her back in her cell.
</li><li> A demon casts BDSM themed torture spells on the main cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf">Dragon Half</a></em>. This immobilizes everyone except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Rufa</a>, who can't get enough of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKawaiComplexGuideToManorsAndHostelBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKawaiComplexGuideToManorsAndHostelBehavior">The Kawai Complex Guide To Manors And Hostel Behavior</a></em>, Shirosaki really enjoys it when the girls punish him. In one example, Granny Sumiko asks him if he could go buy some fish for dinner. He then says she needs to be more abusive. She remembers, then tells him to go buy fish while insulting him. He then wholeheartedly agrees to it.
</li><li> In one of the early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>, after getting a blast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture">high-voltage current</a> from a soldier, Excel requests "A bit higher, please" with a blush. The torturer thinks his gear is malfunctioning and tries it on the unfortunate fellow next to Excel. Said fellow is promptly <em>incinerated</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Lisa, Kosame, and Fukuyama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo">Girls Bravo</a></em>. Naturally, that makes things difficult for Yukinari, Kirie, and Koyomi, respectively. For example, in one scene Lisa attempts to molest Yukinari but he shoves her so hard in retaliation that she rolls back and slams against a wall, blood squirting from her head. Lisa's response is...to give a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a>, get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom">Glowing Eyes of Doom</a>, and scream "Geez, Yukinari-sama! You're unexpectedly violent! But that's fine, please be more reckless with me!" She then proceeds to chase him again, perfectly content with her arms outstretched for a hug. In another scene Kirie prepares to do her usual wrestling moves on Fukuyama and Kosame immediately hugs her legs saying "AH! Onee-sama! Please do that move on me as well!" And Fukuyama continues to act like a huge pervert towards the girls despite knowing Kirie will just beat the crap out of him for it. In fact, it seems to make him even more willing to act like a pervert towards the girls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid">My Bride is a Mermaid</a></em>: On one occasion, Lunar tries to punish Nagasumi by tying him up and repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">grinding her heel into his crotch from behind</a>. He actually <em>enjoys</em> it.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Buggy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. Presumably, torture might work on him, just <em>not</em> using sharp objects, seeing as they don't work on him because of his Bara Bara no Mi Devil Fruit power. As a result, he was easily able to survive his incarceration on the first level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Impel Down</a>, because that's exactly how the prisoners on that level were tortured. (For some reason, none of the guards ever noticed that, and neglected to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">seastone restrainers</a> on him.)
</li><li> Germany from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>. Or so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">Italy</a> claims at gunpoint. France too. After his April Fool's rampage, some of his victims capture him and attempt to humiliate him in retaliation... only to find that he actually enjoys most of their punishment. Until Sweden comes up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>, that is.
</li><li> Ayeka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> tries electro-torture on Ryoko early on in the OVA's. It doesn't quite work as intended. Her lines translate as something along the lines of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Ahh, I'm coming, I'm coming!</a>" (For the record, that's exactly how Pioneer translated it in the official English dub.)
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplemental material</a> reveals that Ryoko's body isn't capable of feeling much of anything, especially in terms of pleasurable sensations. Then again, thousands of years of only being able to feel pain might have simply led to her <em>liking</em> it because it was better than feeling nothing at all. However, she reacts VERY differently when exposed to the Master Key immediately after the electric shocks. If she HAD been faking, she'd probably just keep doing so.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the ninjas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NininGaShinobuden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NininGaShinobuden">Ninin Ga Shinobuden</a></em> discovers a new kink as he's getting spanked during one of Miyabi's rampages.
</li><li> Slan, the only female member of the Godhand from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, definitely qualifies as this. When Guts fights her at one point in the manga, the only thing that he accomplishes by impaling her and blowing off half her torso is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrgasmicCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrgasmicCombat">giving her an orgasm</a></em>. Because that alone wouldn't be creepy enough for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, it should be noted that it's not actually her body at the time.

</div></li><li> Ruby in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em> manga is a masochist, which <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/rosario_vampire_season_ii/v04/c015/1.html">chapter 15 of R+V II<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> seems to be dedicated to. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedHeat">chain linking her to Tsukune</a> shocks her with Tsukune's excess power, in order to force him to learn how to control it. However, Ruby literally <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/rosario_vampire_season_ii/v04/c015/31.html">orgasms<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> over the feedback. Kurumu even lampshades it immediately after.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kurumu:</strong> "You act all innocent, but you, Ruby... are <em>kinky</em>!"
</div><ul><li> She has also likened tying herself up bondage-style to "wrapping the phone cord around your finger when you're bored", and does it with equal frequency. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Harem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Harem">Harem</a> was asked what they were to Tsukune (read: what they <em>want</em> to be to him), her immediate response was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/rosario_vampire_season_ii/v06/c023/14.html">"toy"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the official Viz translation uses "plaything" as the answer, but the meaning is preserved).
</li><li> During the Volume 4 omakes the other girls try on the chain and let Tsukune shock them once. Kurumu and Koko hate it, Mizore is on the fence about it, Yukari likes it, and the very last panel has Moka try. Yukari looks on at Moka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayItWithHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayItWithHearts">reaction</a> and states "Moka is a "yea" for sure!"
</li><li> Taken to the logical extreme in chapter 44 where one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">division leaders</a> electrocute Ruby and she decides she doesn't need to defend against it because she "doesn't hate being shocked."
<ul><li> She then counterattacks with a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a> magical armor, called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Iron Maiden</a>, which she seems to enjoy as well.
</li><li> Played with in that same instance. Kurumu notices that Ruby is actually badly weakened by the experience (and <em>not</em> in a good way) but is acting otherwise so the team won't worry about her.
</li></ul></li><li> When a doppelganger posing as Tsukune gives Ruby what's intended to be a rib-breaking elbow smash, her response is to hug him with a blush of pleasure and beg him to hit her again.
</li></ul></li><li> Kakihara in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller">Ichi the Killer</a></em> manga might be the very <em>god</em> of this trope. The whole series actually evolves around him pursuing something <em>so</em> insanely hardcore that even <em>he</em> will get off on it. The film downplays this somewhat but is still an example of the trope.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>. Poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Sacchan</a>, nobody wants to beat her.

At first, he hates them, but once his turn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a> is complete, he hardly duels <em>without</em> them.
<ul><li> Also, Yubel, who enjoys pain and insults. The only things that can scare them are being separated from the one they love forever, and the threat of being erased from existence.
<ul><li> It's more than enjoying the pain and insults. Yubel truly believes for most of the third season that extreme agony is the only way to express real love. If you don't hurt the person you claim you love, you don't actually love them.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> It's implied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MichikoToHatchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MichikoToHatchin">Michiko &amp; Hatchin</a></em> that Atsuko would become aroused whenever Michiko would beat her up as a child.
</li><li> Gauron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>. Face it — don't even <em>try</em> to torture or threaten him. He <em>likes</em> it. He's so hardcore to the point where he didn't even seem to mind that much that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sharks ate his arms and legs, and he lost an eye, being rendered completely immobile</span>. And apparently, even in that sorry state, he's still in the mood to get off on seeing Sousuke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">depressed face</a>.
<ul><li> The same goes for the female scientist that Gauron was strangling, as further explained in the novels. They <em>both</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence">seemed to enjoy it</a>, as Gauron even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it by mocking her, asking her if she actually <em>likes</em> making him angry, and actually <em>wants</em> him to hurt her. He says this with a perfect mixture of "coldness and joy," and she responds by gasping with "pain and ecstasy."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FightIppatsuJuudenChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FightIppatsuJuudenChan">Fight Ippatsu! Juuden-chan!!</a></em> has Arresta, who nearly orgasms (and wets herself) whenever hit by Sento's baseball bat.
</li><li> Takuma Fudou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> shows definite signs of being this. He actually enjoys and savors pain during battles, and is shown to start cutting his own chest up while yelling at Ban to "push him to the limit and make him bleed" when Ban doesn't put up enough of a fight. It's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by other characters, who mention the stark difference between Fudou and Ban: Fudou lives for the sadomasochistic, bloody sensation of battle, whereas Ban has no such desire and is a cold professional. On another note, although Fudou seems to have carried a huge grudge for Ban ripping his arm off, it's implied that it's not actually the <em>pain</em> that Fudou hated so much as what was likely Ban's <em>attitude</em> when he did it. Fudou even mentions that he kept his rotting, maggot-infested arm with him, and the sensation he felt were "incredible chills rising up his body."
</li><li> Hidan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> pretty much orgasmed when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> impaled himself, killing Asuma</span>.
</li><li> Q and R from <em>Seikon No Qwaser</em> run around begging people to order or punish them sadistically, and when they don't consider the response to be enough for them, they "disqualify" their target in a very violent fashion. Even when they did encounter someone who impaled them on copper poles and shocked them to death with electricity, they regenerated and begged for more.

<ul><li> Aoba admitted to Izaya that he's a masochist who is still looking for a special someone to be his sadist.

So much so that it comes as no surprise when it's revealed that they're dating and that they frequently engage in violent sex and hope to do the same to Inugami whom they both lust after.
<ul><li> Ryuuko, however, starts subverting it later. Unlike Haguro, her love for torture <em>does</em> have some small limits...

<ul><li> Rip Van Winkle. During their battle, Alucard grabs Rip by the throat, slowly sticks her rifle through her chest until it comes out the other side of her body in an act of symbolic rape, and then sinks his fangs into her neck. And (in the OVA) how does Rip react to this? By blushing and letting out a series of orgasmic moans. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeSheIsEnjoyingIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeSheIsEnjoyingIt">It's helped by Maaya Sakamoto's voice acting.</a> In the manga, the scene is drawn pretty much exactly like a hentai doujin (and Hirano DID quite a bit of those), down to the ridiculously intense blush on Rip's cheeks when Alucard drinks her blood. And her constant wriggling and gasping under his hands as he slowly inserts the rifle through her torso. And no, the rifle doesn't have a bayonet. Alucard just jammed it in, barrel first. It also doesn't help the author stated that Rip is an amalgamation of all of his fetishes.
</li><li> Alucard could also qualify for this trope since he usually lets people shoot him full of lead before he kills them.

Virgo looks like she's in heaven as she asks Lucy to use a wooden horse (well, dragon, same principle) on her. For a character based on the Zodiac Constellation of the Maiden, it really makes you wonder if she's really a virgin.

She'd actually been chasing <em>both</em> of their disguised forms in that episode of <em>Super S</em>. Earlier, in one episode of <em>S</em>, she got jealous because her fellow Senshi had been targeted for their Heart Crystals and starts going out of her way to draw an attack on herself. It actually <em>works</em>, but here's the funny part. Normally, the process makes the victim faint almost instantly. Minako held out for <em>several minutes</em>, crying out that she had been worthy of an attack and taking the crystal with her a considerable distance (whilst also outrunning the villain responsible for it, and said villain is on <em>a car</em>) before finally fainting deep in a parking garage.

</li><li> A more modern, and really quite blatant, example would be Darkness from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba">KonoSuba</a></em>. Being called by her real name (Lalatina) is the only kind of humiliation she doesn't enjoy. Ironically, her eagerness to be put through the wringer, and the enjoyment she gets from it, makes her a rather ideal tank... that is, if you don't need her to actually deal any damage, as her sword skills are rather subpar.
<ul><li> One particular instance is when she's possessed by Vanir, one of the Demon King's finest, who, after latching the mask containing his consciousness onto Darkness' face, attempts to drive her into submission with intense pain. The contradictory feedback he gets makes Vanir increasingly uncomfortable, and whenever Darkness regains control, she has a big stupid grin on her face.

He could have broken out at any time but decided not to. Why? <em>Because he enjoyed it</em>. He then gets attacked by a golem (essentially a mecha with machine guns) and the attack makes him <em>excited</em>. The same thing happens when one of the teachers turns into a werewolf and attacks him. He thinks the teacher is essentially <em>flirting with him</em>. The whole time after a failed attack he then goes and plants a very forceful French kiss on the attacker after which he moves on. He was described in-universe as being a sadomasochist.

When the Marshal is tortured, he thanks the torturer for letting him feel again, if for only a moment. Then he feeds the torturer to cannibals.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> doesn't seem to have a problem with pain, though he laughs at everything so take that as you will. At least once he was seen tied to a chair and beaten up by a so-called sadist. After a while, he pointed out how utterly ineffective the man was at torture by pointing out, quite correctly, that due to the man's lack of imagination, the face, the only part he had really focused on hitting, had mostly desensitized, and that since he had been focusing so intently in the area without specialized tools (which would be the case if the point of it all was deformity) led the Joker to conclude the man had no real gameplan beyond merely dishing out as many punches as he could, making him a complete bore.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SalvationRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SalvationRun">Salvation Run</a></em>, it's revealed that he's in CONSTANT pain ever since the night he was bathed in the chemicals that made him the Joker, and he's just gotten used to it and gotten to like it.
</li><li> His consort <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a> sometimes falls in this category as well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
<ul><li> This is jokingly mentioned when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> handcuffs her in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a></em> comic. Harley states that she finds being bound enjoyable since it reminds her of the kinky games she used to play with the Joker.
</li><li> In one comic, Harley ties up a cab driver and duct-tapes the man's mouth shut. When the guy cries out, Harley tells him to shut up and states that surely this isn't the first time he's ever been bound and gagged by a pretty woman.

When future Torquemada readily admits various heresies, such as asserting that the Earth is round and claiming himself to be a God, he's strapped to a torture rack.

In the comic, Mr. Vandemar charges into a fireball with his tongue hanging out, as though he were lapping up the flames; Mr. Croup, meanwhile, seems to derive almost-orgasmic pleasure from devouring a rare vase, blood pouring from his mouth as he swallows the glass shards.
<ul><li> In Croup's case this is possibly more pleasure taken in destroying something of great value which is also ancient and beautiful, but masochism certainly wouldn't be at odds with his characterization.

Though he obviously feels pain, he only laughs, telling that he can't help it as the torture tickles before passing out. Any less amount of pain and he just speaks his usual nonsense, meaning that torture for any other reason, would most likely be fairly useless. Safe to say that any psychological torture he would only find even more funny.

Sturm, being a Solamnic Knight, stoically endures everything with nary a change of expression. Tasselhoff, on the other hand, helpfully makes suggestions to his torturer. Being a Kender, he's incapable of feeling fear, and his bones are difficult to break — and heal quickly. Thus, the worst thing the minotaurs can do is to BORE him by trying the same form of torture for more than ten minutes, which is why he starts making suggestions. In the end, the torturer might have come away from the session feeling worse than his victim — if nothing else, he probably got a nasty headache.

However, he proves too kinky to torture and the only thing that eventually works is sensory deprivation.

The villain Gabriel's dream was to be slowly killed by Anita. Nathaniel, a protagonist, was also quite the masochist. As well as Narcissus, who was more of a grey character. Gabriel actually wanted to rape, kill and eat Anita, while she was armed and doing her best to kill him. He was very masochistic, not suicidal. And he's never actually tortured. Also, Nathaniel has limits, but Raina and Gabriel broke him so that he was incapable of saying "no". He is shown badly hurt and clearly not enjoying it in "Narcissus in Chains" (pinned to the wall by multiple blades) and mentions that he was enjoying prostituting himself until he was gutted in "Burnt Offerings", but not during or after.

He is known throughout the land for being an open homosexual and masochist, tells the reader about the time he was whipped when he was 12, and realized he liked it. But he is nearly driven to tears <em>before the real torture even starts</em> when the guards are allowed to "play with him."
</li><li> <em>The Pilfered Princess</em>: Sarah annoys her torturer by orgasming during a torture session, and spends the entire story begging Inferno to "rape" her. Because, frankly, the Dark Lord's ogres, trolls and other assorted underlings just aren't that good at the whole sex thing.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Wheel of Time</a></em>, the Aiel are very, very resistant to torture. Perrin only manages to break his Shaido prisoner in the ninth book by chopping off one of his hands and threatening to chop off his other hand and his feet and leave him like that. When Egwene finally masters the Aiel technique she starts laughing her head off while being beaten, much to her captor's startlement. Semirhage, as the best torturer in the history of existence, doesn't eventually get broken through torture but by the humiliation of being spanked by a woman less than a seventh of her age.

The Vogon captain proceeds to read his poetry, the third worst in the universe, but Arthur bluffs his way out of it, claiming he actually <em>enjoyed</em> the poem. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, he was lying; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">the television show</a> displays him in the same pain as Ford, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">the film</a> simply shows him confused but certainly uncomfortable.</span> He and Ford start an improvised literary analysis, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but the captain is not convinced and dumps the two out an airlock.

<ul><li> It's possible Arthur was better able to resist the torture than Ford due to indirect Earthling exposure to the worst poetry in the universe: that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex</a>.
</li><li> Ford Prefect is implied to have a version of this related to the Janx Spirit drinking game, where the eventual loser is forced to perform a forfeit, "which was usually obscenely biological". It then states that Ford Prefect usually played to <em>lose</em>.

The natural extension then was to reshape their bodies and inflict this exquisite pain upon others.
<ul><li> In the original short story the Cenobites, or Order of the Gash, have nothing to do with Hell and everything to do with sensation. Meaning they inflict their tortures and deformities on <em>themselves</em> for novelty's sake.

In episode 22 of Season 2 ("The Wire") Dr. Bashir discovers that Garak has an implant in his brain that is wired to stimulate the pleasure centers of his brain to produce large amounts of endorphins whenever Garak suffers strong physical pain. Originally, it was meant to "protect" Garak against physical torture. During his exile among Bajorans (who hate Cardassians), humans and other aliens, Garak built a device that allowed him to remotely control the implant and turn it on or off whenever he wanted. At first, Garak had merely planned on using the implant from time to time, whenever the stress and depression of eking out an existence as a humble tailor on a space station among hostile aliens became too much for him. But one day, as he admits to Dr. Bashir, he turned the implant on and never turned it off; he became addicted to the high endorphin levels.

There Head-Six appears to him and coaxes him into having sex, with her which results in a rather <em>explicit</em> reaction from Baltar. Naturally, D'Anna is really weirded out. Seriously, if the guy you are torturing and who only a moment ago was writhing in agony suddenly starts writhing in arousal and yelling "I love you!" and "Don't stop!" over and over doesn't make you think he's gone completely bonkers, lost his marbles, or gone nuts, then you're probably unflappable.

Similarly to the Dark Mistress from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper</a></em> as mentioned below, her worshipers absolutely adore pain, both inflicting it and experiencing it—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatSadomasochist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatSadomasochist">in a battle</a> too.

Estranged brother of the Goddess of Love, he presides over darkness, suffering, and sadomasochism. He is depicted in styles reminiscent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser">Cenobites</a>, having flayed and pierced his flesh countless times. His priesthood's creed is 'Experience Without Limits', and one of their most holy ceremonies involves stripping one of their number of limbs, eyes, ears, tongue, and lips (and often eating them in the process), leaving a head and torso which are kept alive to be violated and tortured ever after. They call this 'The Joymaking', and the victims are high ranking priests. They don't just volunteer, they <em>demand</em> it be done to them.

They're crazy enough to <em>enjoy</em> things like Yanni concerts and five-alarm curries.
</li><li> This is why the Inquisition in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> hate having to deal with Chaos cultists from the Slaanesh faction. At least one Inquisitor found a sensory deprivation tank the best option. Makes sense.
<ul><li> Whatever you do to Slaaneshi Cults, if they win, they get the high of winning. If they lose, they get an experience of loss to savor. In fact, in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> novel at least one of the Slaaneshi cultist got off on being killed, and the others were fighting <em>each other</em> to get hacked to pieces, which lead to a great deal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> from Cain when he realised that they were actually getting sexual pleasure from being slaughtered.
</li><li> One example of this is towards the end of the novel <em>Fulgrim</em> where one of Ferrus Mannus' bodyguards is about to crush a fallen Emperor's Children legionnaire, the legion that fell to Slaanesh, who took a full hit from a flamethrower and pauses when he sees the look on the Marine's face isn't pain from having his entire body burned with futuristic napalm but ecstatic pleasure. This pause doesn't end well for said bodyguard.
</li><li> Easiest way to deal with Chaos followers would be a Pariah — particularly a Culexus Assassin. Just force them to stay in its presence. Pariahs are utterly discomforting even to regular people, and even more so to those touched by the Warp. The "sensation" is not even pleasurable to Slaaneshi cultists, as it is actually a way of <em>cutting off</em> their sensation of contact from the warp, deadening a sense that they have based their whole self around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Dark Eldar</a> get bonus points by actually getting <em>physically rejuvenated</em> by torture.

However, the Dark Eldar had a breakdown when one of them had the idea to lock him in an empty room with nothing to do.

<ul><li> Raven is an immortal who just can't die, and as a result he has come to immensely enjoy pain. Getting hit by other characters' attacks, including supers and <em>instant-kills</em>, excites him (as in, while there are attacks which the aforementioned I-No and Faust find terrifying, Raven doesn't mind at all), and he even further provokes his enemies to hurt him more. Furthermore, he is the only character whose instant-kill is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Suicide Attack</a> (immolating himself and his opponent), and he can survive even that.

But while the commentary for various characters is along the lines of disgust, Azrael basically asks him "That all you have?"
<ul><li> The same move puts Nine the Phantom in a cauldron to be boiled alive. She looks more like Relius interrupted her bath.

</li><li> In Bang's gag reel, Azrael makes several comments about how lame the various tortures happen to be - he compares the cold of round 2 unfavorably to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Kokonoe's freezer</a>, and even asks in round 5 to "amp up the juice" when everyone is being electrocuted. He even makes a snappy comment when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being digested by Arakune!

This is over the phone as Kessler had just gotten through torturing Sasha another villain in the story, despite Cole's indifference to Sasha as a person, as a result of her psychological torture on him and her sexual advances on him that he was blatantly uninterested in, he finds Kessler to be disgusting for torturing her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em> has an Interrogation Chair, a chair Sims can tie other Sims up in to extract information either by "Persuasion," which requires interactions the Sim will like, or "Interrogation," which requires interactions the Sim will not like.

Almost, but not quite, this trope, since the interaction still affects their Will and can lead to the interrogating Sim getting the information.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em>, you must free a pimp who is being held in a BDSM club. When you attempt to interrogate one of the club's...clients, the man actually begs you to hit him, saying how he's "been very bad." And no, the dialogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">doesn't change according to the Player's gender</a>.

Lampshaded by a couple of the main characters when they can't figure out why she's cheerfully camping out as a prisoner of the Templars and submitting to their experiments when their control chip doesn't actually work on her.

When talking to some of the less... 'friendly' demons in a battle, they will sometimes ask the player character to scream for them, or even state their intent to 'bully' the party (most likely with a hard-hitting spell). Being too eager to scream, or answering 'I want more!' to being bullied, will often make a demon flat-out leave the battle in disgust.

</li><li> Scarecrow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Injustice2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Injustice2">Injustice 2</a></em> uses his Fear Toxin to create his bizarre, unpredictable gameplay and disturbing visuals.

Unfortunately for her, she is much stronger than she expects, which leaves her disappointed as she easily slays powerful Nightmares she expected to hurt her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has a situation that falls under the heading of this trope although it's not a literal example. In the Death Knight starting area you fight the Scarlet Crusade. One of the quests sends you out with a magical torture rod made by a literal vampire to get information from the Crusaders.
