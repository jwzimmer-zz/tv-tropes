The writers explain a bit, but not all of it, so they can milk the Mysterious Past some more. Unfortunately, they then repeat this trick so often that there's practically no room left for even more mysterious-pastness. It's unclear that the character ever had time to have a mysterious past with all the revelations we've already seen; and it's ironic that, for all their supposed mystery, these characters tend to have more backstory than any of the other characters.
</p><p>In extreme cases, when the bits of the backstory simply cannot be chained together, we get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a>.

<ul><li> Parodied with Ginji in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalProjectS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalProjectS">Magical Project S</a></em>, who is often alluded to having done tons of improbable things and has a wallet full of licenses to prove it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, there were no less than <em>three</em> separate flashbacks for Sasuke to the night Itachi massacred the Uchiha clan. The last one feels tacked on; it would have painted Itachi in a completely different light had it been included in the first place, but Sasuke claimed that he had simply tried to forget those specific memories.
<ul><li> Thought it does answer the continuity error of why Sasuke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Sharingan</a> was activated by fighting Haku and not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Tsukuyomi</a> (namely that it <em>was</em>, he just didn't realize it for several years).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> seems to do this with Asuna after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> made the story much more dramatic, although there are a few hints in the earlier chapters that imply it was planned all along. To wit: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Negi was <em>not</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage">Inept Mage</a> when he accidentally erased Asuna's clothes. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> aura screwed up the spell.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, the viewer gradually learns more and more details about what happened when the Elric brothers tried to revive their mother with alchemy, especially what's behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GateOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GateOfTruth">Gate of Truth</a>. The Ishval Rebellion receives this treatment to some degree.
</li><li> Most incarnations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s Shunsaku Ban. Amusingly, he looks a bit like Jamie Hyneman.
</li><li> Polar Bear from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShirokumaCafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShirokumaCafe">Polar Bear's Cafe</a></em> tells a touching story about his reasons for opening the cafe, and then Sasako brings up that he had told her a completely different version of events. He then shrugs and says both versions work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Penguin</a> thinks he's making it all up.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> writers like introducing new elements into Team Rocket's past in any episode centered around them. After 16 years of this, their backstory has become extremely convoluted. One of the characters lived in 4 different regions, flunked out of medical school, was trained in the art of ninjitsu, held a position as a weather forecaster, worked as a professional model, and was in a biker gang at some point. All this was BEFORE becoming an internationally wanted criminal. Oh, and she apparently doesn't know this, but her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a> used to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">second in command of Team Rocket</a> before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">presumably dying on a mission to recover Mew</span>. To make matters worse they're in their late teens at earliest, mid twenties at oldest.
<ul><li> Further compounded by the fact that we are repeatedly told that Musashi / Jessie was dirt-poor growing up, to the point that she had to eat snow to avoid going hungry. Not the standard background for such a dilettante.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">     Comics </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLanternRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLanternRebirth">Green Lantern: Rebirth</a></em>, the colored lanterns of the Emotional Spectrum are introduced to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> mythos, having retroactively existed alongside the Green Lantern Corps. Their past can then be elaborated on with flashbacks or time travel, often sharing a history with the Green Lanterns.
</li><li> <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> Arguably the most famous example of this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>: He's a soldier, mutant, science experiment, ninja, assassin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a>, miner, aristocrat's son, biker with amnesia, and so on. His time in World War II alone is an example of this trope, where Wolvie has fought in different battles spanning from France, to North Africa, to Russia, to Italy... all the while spending <em>months</em> being tortured and killed over and over in a concentration camp just to mess with some Nazi's head. Somehow during this period, he managed to also spend the key war years in Japan being trained as a samurai, taking a Japanese wife, and having a son. And you thought being in multiple squads of the X-Men and the Avengers, while also going on his solo adventures, was an incredible accomplishment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>, in addition to having a legitimate Expansion Pack Past, also pokes fun at the idea. Among his time with Weapon X, Flirtations with Death (literally), and time with the X-Men, he's done all sorts of wacky oddjobs. This includes being trained as a <em>Sumo Wrestler</em> (a clear parody of Wolverine's samurai training).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> bears mention. Not only do we learn new things about his background every other week, but they blatantly contradict each other. Circus performer with freakish appearance but cheerful outlook. Check. Raised by Roma witch Margoli Szardos. Check. Girlfriend turns out to be adopted sister (Margoli's biological daughter Jimaine Szardos aka Amanda Sefton) and yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings">they still date</a>. Um...ok. Is revealed to be a devout Catholic. Not impossible, but highly unlikely given his background. Biological mother turns out to be Mystique, who threw him over the edge of a waterfall to escape pursuers after she was revealed to be a mutant. Not only does that not vibe with the earlier story of Margoli finding him with his dead mother, but she had no way of knowing his father's surname was Wagner. Oh, and his biological father is an ancient demon. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">But we don't like to talk about that.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Storm">Storm</a> got hit with this even earlier than Wolverine. When she first appeared, she was simply a young woman in rural Kenya whose tribe worshiped her as a goddess due to her power to control the weather. Then it turned out she was born in the United States and even has a Western last name (Munroe). Then when she was a baby, she and her parents moved to Cairo where her parents were killed in the Arab-Israeli Conflict. Afterwards she spent her childhood living as a petty thief, <em>then</em> as a teenager she traveled east to Kenya—discovering her mutant powers along the way and having a fling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">T'Challa</a>—where she was taken in by her mother's tribe and worshiped as a goddess. When she was approached by Xavier to join his new team of X-Men, it's implied that she had never left Kenya before, but given what we now know about her background and the fact that she was in her early 20's when recruited, she couldn't have possibly lived in Kenya longer than a few years.
</li><li> Professor Xavier himself often falls victim to this trope. While it's certainly within character that he led a colorful life before founding his school, most of his past was well-established...until the <em>Deadly Genesis</em> miniseries which revealed that the All-New All-Different X-Men were actually Xavier's <em>second</em> attempt at reforming the team following the original X-Men's abduction by Krakoa. The rescue team he originally cobbled together were all killed or presumed to be killed until one of them, Vulcan, came back for revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Elisa Cameron, the eponymous hero of the comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostDarkHorseComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostDarkHorseComics">Ghost</a></em>, has an incredibly convoluted backstory that fits into this trope, although it's all explained, more or less, by the end of the series. The second series, that is, after they canceled the writer of the first 36 shaggy-dog issues and started a new volume at #1. The blinding rate of actual revelations in the second series contrasts with the three-year tease of the first series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Scrooge McDuck</a>, as written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a>, was neck deep in this until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> came along and, in a Crowning Moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">Arc Welding</a>, made most of his backstory fit together in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a></em>. However, since other writers are usually not so concerned with continuity, they tend to introduce new elements of Scrooge's past which typically serve the needs of a single story and are never heard of ever again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> in all of his versions (but mainly the comics) has this for the time between the death of his parents (and sometimes even before) and the first time he put on the cape and cowl.
<ul><li> Especially concerning the events leading up the fateful day they went out to see Zorro. Grant Morrison has it so Bruce's dad decided to have a family day to cheer Bruce up because the kid escaped being decapitated by an immortal, Satan-worshipping school teacher. No, really.
</li><li> Speaking of Bats, The Joker enjoys the fact his past is, to him contradictory and muddled.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s war service between 1940 (yes, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nazi">Nazi-punching</a> days predate the formal entry of the USA in the war) and 1945. He's probably had more adventures in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">World War II</a> than there were days in the war; there's a tendency for stories involving him to feature a one or two-page flashback to some World War II event to contrast with whatever's happening in the present. Famous World War II events (D-Day, for example), have been retold frequently with conflicting information about what he was doing then.
<ul><li> His latest series as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch further elaborates Steve's past <em>prior</em> to becoming Captain America by showing the hardships he and his family had to endure as an immigrant family in an America that was faced with the coming of the Great Depression.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a> has this even more, since he ended up as a brainwashed Soviet assassin that was kept on ice when not on assignment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> did this for Bearclaw, Mantricker and Kahvi. Although most of Bearclaw's stories are pretty solid, Mantricker's timeline is broken beyond all help - and for the family trees to still make sense, some of the later writers literally had to have Kahvi <em>fall into a magical plot hole</em> for a few thousand years.
</li><li> In Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GIJoeARealAmericanHeroMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GIJoeARealAmericanHeroMarvel">G.I. Joe</a></em> comics it got ridiculous how one by one it was revealed that Snake-Eyes had connections to almost every major villain in his past. Trying very hard to make this brief: He served with Storm Shadow in Vietnam. Baroness' brother was also killed in Vietnam while Snake-Eyes was nearby, and she ended up falsely believing he had killed her brother. Destro and his father come to the scene shortly afterwards just as Baroness is leaving, and note that her brother was wearing a bulletproof vest which would have stopped the bullets from Snake-Eyes' pistol. When he returned home, he learned that his family had all perished in a head-on collision with a drunk driver, who also died. The person driving the other car was the brother of the man who would later become Cobra Commander. Next, Snake-Eyes heads to Japan to join the Arashikage clan...which turns out to be the clan Storm Shadow was born into. His time there comes to an end when Zartan murders the clan head and frames Storm Shadow for it. Finally, it was later revealed that Firefly was with the Arashikage clan as well under the persona of "Faceless Master". Out of all the most enduring villains that only leaves Major Bludd with no ties to Snake-Eyes.
</li><li> Of the three main characters and two main recurring characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em>, only the recurring character Gustavo Garian (the only one whose debut included his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory">Origin Story</a>) doesn't have this, expanding on many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incidents</a>:
<ul><li> It took years for Diabolik's past to be revealed: he was an orphan who didn't know his real name and was raised on an island of only thieves, where he learned the trade and invented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">Latex Perfection</a> before having to kill his father figure King (who baptized him Diabolik, as it's the name of a panther that had nearly killed King years before) when he decided to have him tell the formula of the masks and then kill him. Then we discovered what he did between his escape from King's Island and his arrival in Clerville, explaining that he learned part of his trade and to be paranoid in another place, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where he also replaced Walter Dorian, a rich arts smuggler identical to Diabolik whose identity was used by our protagonist before being outed as Diabolik</span>. Then we discovered what happened to him as he settled in Clerville before the series. Then we discovered what happened between the first and the story of the series. <em>Then</em> we discover a few facts about Diabolik's past on King's Island. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says there are still tales to tell about his past, including <em>his real identity</em> (King has hidden documents revealing it in an extremely resistant time capsule hidden somewhere);
</li><li> When she appears, Eva Kant is immediately stated to have acquired her last name by marriage to a man who died devoured by a panther (an accident, Eva explains), and that she spent most of her money to ward off blackmailers. A later story explains she married her husband because he was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">her uncle</a></em> and she wanted to take back her last name, and that she was innocent of what she had been blackmailed for. Then a later story explains exactly how all of that happened, that she had paid off the blackmailers because she had still been their accomplice (so they <em>did</em> have some dirt on her, only less than what they believed), and that the panther killing her husband being explained as an accident was her proving herself the greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> of the series: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her husband had set the panther on her to try and kill her, but Eva set the beast on him <em>by accident</em></span>;
</li><li> Ginko's past was alluded to in multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incidents</a>, before being explained in the story <em>Ginko: Before Diabolik</em>. Then a previously unknown part was told in a following story, enacting this trope but still giving him the less complicated past of the main characters;
</li><li> Altea first appears as a liberal duchess in Benglait, a kingdom on the verge of the revolution. After the revolution it's discovered her mother is from Clerville, and she still has some properties there. Later it's discovered she became a duchess by marriage, and she's the daughter of an admiral. Then it's discovered her late husband, who had died attacked by a shark, was on the first line in the battle against a terrorist organization <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that he actually controlled to start a civil war, and he faked his death to avoid being exposed</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BigTroubleInLittleChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BigTroubleInLittleChina">Big Trouble in Little China</a></em> likes to talk about all the previous Mrs. Burtons. It turns out Jack has had run-ins with the occult before, and just never caught on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>
<ul><li> Superman was so successful that by the mid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">40s</a> he got his alternate <em>Superboy</em> story lines where the reader got to see adventures he had during his teenage years when he lived in Smallville with his foster parents the Kents. It also introduced Clark Kent's childhood friends Pete Ross and Lana Lang. A lot of the elements presented in the <em>Superboy</em> storylines became canon.
<ul><li> For example, he was made an honorary member of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> as a teenager.
</li><li> And becoming pals with a teenager Bruce Wayne!
</li><li> He found his old Kryptonian super-pets, especially Krypto, the super-dog.
</li><li> Then he also got a college girlfriend named Lori Lemaris.
</li></ul></li><li> Clark Kent's Kryptonian roots: during the first decade of the Superman comic books, Supes had at best a very nebulous idea of his origins. Only in the late 40s did he learn his extraterrestrial past for sure. From then on, the comics kept elaborating on this theme.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a> took over the series in the mid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">80s</a>, DC also expanded on what happened to the mysterious years in between Clark leaving the Kent farm and him getting a job as a journalist for the Daily Planet.
<ul><li> For example, Clark worked as a dishwasher to pay for college, becoming involved with a waitress. Plus he also spent a few months in a monastery in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina">Red China</a> before Bruce Wayne became a pupil in that same place.
</li><li> Also, it turns out that during Kent's childhood the Manhunters manipulated all of Smallville's children to look out for Superman.
</li><li> The Conduit saga introduced Kenny Braverman as another of Clark Kent's childhood friend.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a>, Lana Lang got two previously unacknowledged brothers who got in the way of the Clark/Lana relationship..
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> also got an expanded past during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">The Silver Age of Comic Books</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Jerry Siegel</a> himself wrote that he had been a childhood friend of Superboy.
<ul><li> Then, after the Byrne reboot Luthor was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who was Perry White's childhood friend and killed his own parents for the insurance money.
</li></ul></li><li> Other Superman villains also got a dose of this trope during both the classic and the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCrisis">Post Crisis</a> eras such as the Prankster who under John Byrne's revamp became a disgruntled former TV star driven to crime by Morgan Edge who fired him from his show.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a> became so popular during the Silver Age that got his background expanded quite fast. At first another alien invading Earth, later appearances would explain he had a centuries long lifespan, that he came from dead planet Bryak and he's trying to repopulate it, hence the city-shrinking mania he has. Then Bryak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">got changed to</a> Colu. Later it was explained that he was actually a robot.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a>, the list of occultist phenomena and people Constantine interacted with in his past only seems to get longer and longer, with a colorful, long-forgotten old friend showing up almost once per storyarc.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a> has gotten quite a bit of mileage of Hellboy's adventures during his earlier career (between the 40's and late 80's).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a> Donna Troy was essentially created by accident, with a writer taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">stories involving a teenage</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> to be stories of Wonder Woman's little sister. Neal Adams then gave Donna a backstory, where she was rescued from a fire by Wonder Woman and taken back to Paradise Island where Hippolyta adopted her, to make her a proper character. This backstory was further expanded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhoIsDonnaTroy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhoIsDonnaTroy">Who Is Donna Troy?</a></em> which named her birth mother and explored how the toddler came to be in that fire at all.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Highlander">Highlander</a></em>, Connor MacLeod has quite a history, being an Immortal, and it just may happen that a newly introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> will share some backstory with his past that hasn't yet caught up to him until the present day.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MacGruber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MacGruber">MacGruber</a></em>. When MacGruber is introduced, we are told of his many tours of duty in pretty much every branch of the military. Many would be impossible, because they occur at the same time or the war was simply too short to accommodate all of them. MacGruber would have to be a hundred-year-old man with a time machine to squeeze them all in.
</li><li> The Moustache in Irma La Douce has a remarkable resume. But that's another story....
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em>, the Transformers involvement with the Earth's past is shown in the first movie, while the sequels reveal even more involvement with the Earth's history.
</li><li> As a film character, for decades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> would be a rather mysterious agent with very little background. The original novels did outline a sketchy Bond bio that the films would never bother acknowledging much for decades. Yet, even the earliest films would have flimsy elements to interconnect the film franchise, mainly the presence of Spectre during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLazenby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLazenby">George Lazenby</a> era; Bond's marriage to Tracy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em>, which would be referenced very fleetingly in a handful of the subsequent movies, the revelation of Bond's family motto in that same film (OHMSS would remain the most intimate portrayal of Bond for decades). Also, a few villains and allies would return for more than one film (for example Blofeld and Jaws, as well as Moneypenny and Felix Leiter). Still, every film essentially remained a self-contained movie with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">little to no background development for Bond</a> until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig">Daniel Craig</a>'s tenure in the title role:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em> would be the first film to refer to Bond's childhood and early youth when Vesper Lind performs an armor piercing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a> on Bond.
</li><li> Following this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace">Quantum of Solace</a></em> would build up on the events of <em>Casino Royale</em>, with Bond looking for closure over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Vesper Lind</span>'s death, searching for her employers and killers.
</li><li> Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> would acknowledge Bond's past as hinted in the novels by showing his childhood home and mentioning Bond's parents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em> would up the ante by not only delving deeper into Bond's past but also by relating his childhood with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> himself, for the first time making Bond's past youth an important plot point.

Sort of inevitable considering he's rebooted the universe (and subsequently relived the whole course of all human history) at least <em>five times</em>. (Or so he says, he's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>.)

There doesn't seem to have been time for him to actually do everything he's supposed to have done, particularly given the time it must have taken for a member of an enemy tribe to win the trust of the Priteni king.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a>". A late-arrival character Androl Genhald has had a remarkably varied past. So far as we know, he's fought in a minor rebellion, sailed two seas, been apprenticed to a leatherworker AND a wisewoman (usually reserved for women), worked as a farmer and a surveyor, and was trained as a swordsman. All of this in the thirty years before joining the Black Tower.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>. Justified with Angel and Spike, since they are centuries-old vampires. Angelus grumbles that Angel's was mostly puppy rescues and Manilow concerts. We learn that Spike's entire persona is a fabrication by himself. "Spike" who used to go by "William the Bloody" was William Pratt, a wimpy poet who got the first nickname because of his "bloody awful poetry" and was considered the runt of his original pack when he was first turned. His current name possibly originates from another critic saying his poetry is as painful as driving a railroad spike through your head. Later he genuinely made a name for himself as a badass by killing two slayers.
<ul><li> This gets really excessive for the title character in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>. While some of the things are understandable in that he has been a vampire for 200 years, and has had a soul for a hundred years, sometimes you wonder exactly what is consistent with his character. The best example is the fourth season, <em>Orpheus</em>, which had a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">It's a Wonderful Plot</a> that actually explained some of what was going through his mind.

Locke's time in a hippie commune, for example, was never mentioned before or since in the series. Somewhat fixed in the fourth season by giving the main characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forwards</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Backs</a>.</span>
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>, as Laura Palmer's past is revealed episode by episode, we learn she's been quite the busy girl. She tutored Josie Packard in English, tutored Johnny Horne, worked at the perfume counter in Horne's department store, worked as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a private escort and as a prostitute at One Eyed Jack's</span>, and also delivered food for Meals on Wheels. Still she had time to juggle two boyfriends, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">feed her cocaine habit, and maintain two diaries (a public one and a secret one), all while dealing with major problems at home</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em> is very guilty of this. Alison <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiLaurentis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiLaurentis">Di Laurentis</a> did more on the night of her disappearance (and apparent murder) than people do in their entire lives.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> is rife with this.
<ul><li> Al has led a storied life before becoming the main character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Holographic Sidekick</a>. He ran away from the orphanage he lived in to join the Circus, traveled with a Pool master, boxed semi-pro, flew for the Navy the Cuban Missile Crisis and then Vietnam, was a POW, was the subject of a Pulitzer Prize photo, attended MIT, marched in the 60s, became an Astronaut, was promoted to Rear Admiral, has been married 5 times (between countless liaisons), was acquitted of murder, speaks Italian, and is a great cook.
</li><li> Sam, on the other hand, just studied to an unholy degree. He speaks 7 languages, has 7 doctorates (including his MD), has a Nobel Prize, played piano at Carnegie Hall, sings, dances, has a photographic memory, went to MIT at 15, won the big game in high school (apparently at 14), grew up on a farm, Studied Tae Kwon Do, invented a time machine, and is also a good cook.
<ul><li> Note that revelations about what Sam can do, knows, or even <em>important details of his own life</em> are justified not just from the perspective of the audience, but the perspective of <strong>Sam himself</strong>, as going through time has 'swiss-cheesed' his brain. Thus, if he doesn't know/remember things he should in earlier episodes based on what we later learn about him, it has a very neat in-story explanation, and they really can (and do) just continue adding to his history and list of skills throughout much of the series.

Everest, and nearly being guillotined.
</li><li> Phoebe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> often makes passing allusions to unusual jobs or situations she was involved in before the series started, although she does have an ordinary backstory as well. And as she's a firm believer in reincarnation, there was at least one flashback scene to Phoebe in a previous life. Whether this is supposed to be purely imaginary is, one supposes, left to the viewer. Lampshaded once when she makes one such reference to her past, gets a lot of blank looks, smiles and says "There's so much you don't know"
</li><li> Wilson W. Wilson, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>, speaks multiple languages, has been to dozens of countries, has studied several esoteric religions and philosophies, and engages in such myriad hobbies as wine-tasting, ant farming, and fire walking.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> really gropes when it tries to come up with what Rangers returning for team-up episodes have been doing since they were last seen. Being a member of the original team, after fifteen years on and off of the screen, Tommy Oliver has been a martial artist, a football player, a race car driver, a paleontologist, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> (seriously!), a high school science teacher, and highly involved in Ranger-ness behind the scenes while between power sources, having made contact with <em>every</em> team even if they were based in space, just visiting from a lot more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, etc. If there's anything "Dr. O" has not been, he <em>will</em> have by the next anniversary teamup to bring him back.

Justified to some extent due to the fact that he's over 400 years old. Several of the other characters have similarly varied pasts, which is also justified because they're usually even older than MacLeod. For example, his drinking buddy Hugh Fitzcairn is 800 years old, his on-and-off girlfriend Amanda is nearly 1200, and Methos is so old that even most immortals think he's a myth; he says his earliest memories date back to 5500 years ago, but he was already an adult and had already experienced his first death (activating his immortality) before that point.

</li><li> Whenever the writers wanted Dax to have an unusual skill or know something unexpected, they just attributed it to one of her past hosts. Given that there were seven such prior hosts, adding up to over 350 years of experience, this was reasonable enough. One extreme example was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ezri Dax, who has no police or security training whatsoever, being the best-suited to stop a serial killer on the station...because one of the previous Dax hosts <em>was</em> a serial killer.

And even <em>that</em> was expanded from a previous episode where that particular host killed just one person.</span>.
</li><li> O'Brien ran into this twice. On TNG, where he was simply the most prominent recurring crewman, he was used a few times when they wanted a known character to add a personal touch to the plot, but didn't want to invest the main characters in it. His past fighting Cardassians with Captain Maxwell being the best example. Also, for several years he wore the rank insignia of a Lieutenant ("Chief" was presumed to be just a shortening of his job title), but he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into being a Senior Chief Petty Officer and thus one of the very few named enlisted personnel in the entire franchise. Then when he moved to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space 9</a></em> as a main character, expanding his past became a matter of necessity.

He got so many contradictory backstories (he was a former soldier, a former teacher, or else a very experienced DJ from New Orleans) that finally they had to make an episode to reconcile the inconsistencies, establishing that he and Andy had simply lied when they said he was an experienced DJ in the first episode.

Subsequent seasons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> tie-in's and supplemental books show that he worked for the LAPD's SWAT Team, Delta Force and the CIA, worked extensive field cases that called on him to do extraordinary feats, indirectly worked for/met with five of the series' major villains (including two members of his own family) years before they would put their plans to overthrow the U.S. into motion, sold out several of his CTU colleagues when they accepted bribes, went undercover in several different gangs and cartels and rescued his wife from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who planned to massacre her and several other civilians on live television.

Many of the stories she recounts are of bizarre sexual liaisons with high-profile celebrities, made all the more hilarious by her dead-pan delivery of these lewd stories. Hilariously, politician John Prescott showed up at her wedding as one of her exes, meaning at least one of her stories is true.

Unfortunately when this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> was written, the character was meant to be played by an actor at least ten years older than Steven Pacey.

Unfortunately this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentTeacherRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentTeacherRomance">Student/Teacher Romance</a> has distinctly creepy overtones once you do the math (it's been over six years since they met, and Dayna is still quite young when she joins the crew). As with Tarrant, this came about because the script was originally written for an older crewmember (Cally, who left the series).

She was a competitive gymnast, has a pilot's licence, and has lived in Osaka, Berlin, Macau, Stockholm — and, it's implied, at least a couple of other cities around the world. Somehow she fit all this in before attending the police academy at the same time as Jake Peralta, who is implied to be older than her (a sonic weapon which only affects under-35s is felt by her but not by him), and who seems to have no past more complicated than "grew up, became a cop".

<ul><li> Played for laughs with the numerous backstories assigned to Grandpa. Among other things, he spent 40 years as the night watchman at a cranberry silo, lived in the Statue of Liberty's head as a child, earned a commission as an under-aged officer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1">World War 1</a> (so under-aged that he still took naps and cried) worked as a strikebreaker during the Depression, fought in World War II as an Army infantryman in Europe, Piloted bombers in the Pacific, and so on. However, despite small hints that some of this is probably true, it's usually chalked up to his delusional senility.
</li><li> A more controversial example would be the episode "That 90's Show", which is half sliding timescale, and half Homer-being-aged-up-from-34-to-38. Set during the period of Marge and Homer's relationship after they had graduated high school but before Bart was conceived/their shotgun marriage, it mainly expanded upon Marge's background by revealing that she was a college graduate and that Homer spend his years after high school as a member of both an R&amp;B boyband (based on Color Me Bad) and a grunge rock group (that was part Nirvana and part Bush), that made him a household name. The fact that logically this occurs <em>after</em> he became world famous for singing barbershop in 1986, as shown in a flashback episode which showed him as older and already married with kids, is probably responsible for most of this controversy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> also plays this trope straight, and usually for laughs, mainly due to its fondness for using quick, random flashbacks for jokes. It doesn't just apply to all the random jobs and activities characters have performed in the past (namely Peter, Brian, and Stewie), but also to how some of the characters met each other. Multiple flashbacks have happened which show Peter meeting Lois, Peter meeting Brian, or Peter meeting Cleveland and/or Quagmire.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a> plays this for laughs with Doofenshmirtz's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">increasingly surreal</a> and traumatic childhood, which somehow involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">his parents being absent from his own birth</a>, repeatedly causing his family to lose prestige, and being ignored in favor of a dog, forced to pose as a lawn gnome, losing a science fair and poetry contest to a baking soda volcano, inexplicably being banned from Albania, and being disowned and raised by ocelots while smelling like pork and also being used as the ball in a dunk tank. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">These last four are never explained</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em> exaggerated this for a running gag, as the titular character's super-competent sidekick, Cornfed Pig, always appeared to have expertise and an extensive background in any task at hand. The trope was subverted to an extent when it was revealed that in all of Cornfed's many adventures, he had never successfully lost his virginity, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> for Cornfed's ridiculous past was attempted, perhaps inadvertently, by showing at least three different flashback scenarios at different times in the series of how he came to be friends with Duckman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> was a pretty good example of this trope, what with the extensive and varied training that Bruce had undergone in the past — everything from samurai training to magic lessons.
<ul><li> Exactly how Bruce planned it. Besides, you can do card tricks in Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> Roger the Alien from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> originally had a two-sentence origin: He was an alien being held at Area 51 who saved Stan's life. To repay him, Stan lets him live in his house. Over time, though Roger's past has been much more colorful — in one episode it was revealed that he's actually been on Earth for over sixty years (he was the alien who crashed in Roswell) and stories of his past exploits keep popping up. Like how during the 70's, he was a millionaire music producer who "invented" disco by exploiting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>, then lost everything when disco died. Or that he's inexplicably an Olympic-class figure skater. Or that he's inadvertently responsible for the death of Biggie Smalls. Or that he fought in the Vietnam War, against the Americans. And he invented MDMA.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, almost every episode featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Demona</a> delved further into her complex backstory.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em> episode <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Van Kleis</a> ends up thousands of years in the past. The episode shows several scenes and montages of him putting himself in suspended animation and waking up some time later. During those waking periods, he was shown being an adviser to the Egyptian Pharoahs, a Roman Gladiator, a Viking warrior, a Samurai and about a thousand other things that make no sense unless for some reason his sarcophagus was constantly being shipped thousands of miles while he was in it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em>: Robert Jebediah "Granddad" Freeman has this in spades. The backstory of the family has them coming from Chicago, and one season one episode clarifies that, having him live in the same neighborhood as fellow Tuskegee Airman pilot Moe Jackson after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Other instances, however, have him living in the segregated south, both when he was very little (his brief flashback about "a funny lynching story"), and when he was a full-grown adult, placing him in general civil rights marches. In what turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> of Huey's, he was also <em>Rosa Parks' accomplice on the bus</em>, though his attempts at defying segregation were ignored in that instance.
