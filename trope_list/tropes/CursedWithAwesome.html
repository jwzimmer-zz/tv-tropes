</p><p>A character has some "terrible" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">curse</a> placed on them (if they weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornWinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornWinner">born with it</a>) that is actually pretty awesome. Often, such characters will bemoan their fate and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">go to great lengths to be rid of the "curse"</a> instead of taking advantage of whatever cool side effects the curse may have.

Sometimes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyIsCool">subset of people try to tell him this</a>.

This is especially a risk if a balance between the awesomeness of the powers and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome">suckiness of the consequences of possessing</a> them is not maintained; if the drawbacks are outweighed by the benefits, then the character just looks whiny. On the other hand, it can make for some great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> if the character is saddled with something that is genuinely difficult to live with, but later figures out a way to benefit from it.

</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment">The Punishment</a> is an extreme form of this and usually done to someone that actually deserves it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spidey would be the trope namer if he had any cool catchphrase that related. Peter Parker is a genius, incredibly powerful (at least compared to us muggles), a successful photographer—who even published a book of Spider-Man photos — and a college student. Despite his poverty, he is able to provide for himself—including crime-fighting gadgets like web-shooters, webbing and costumes—his aged aunt and his supermodel wife. Remember? He bagged a chick so hot she should be using dorks like him as a paperweight. Not to mention Gwen Stacey, Betty Brant, Liz Allen, the Black Cat, Deb Whitman...
</li><li> This is ultimately deconstructed during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> saga. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a>, having hijacked'd Peter's body, uses it to be a superior Spidey. However, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenGoblin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenGoblin">Green Goblin</a> opts to bring everything down around his ears, he comes to realize that Peter purposesly stops himself from using his Awesome because of things like this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManNoir">Spider-Man: Noir</a></em>: When Peter got bitten by the mystic spiders, he hallucinated that a spider god would give him "The Curse Of Power". Considering how the Spider-Man powers have affected other Spider-Man, this isn't actually that far off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted with The Juggernaut. Those who are bestowed with the power of Cyttorak through his crimson gem are also compelled to do evil, regardless of their previous nature. However, Cain Marko is a natural sociopath, and doesn't need much prodding. When Cain tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turn over a new leaf</a> and joined the X-Men, Cyttorak was very unhappy with this development. Thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion">Cain's power was greatly reduced</a> and he was pushed into returning to a life of evil to regain the lost power.
</li><li> In its early history, the X-Men themselves tended to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">attractive heroes</a> who felt awkward about their powers, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">villains who reveled in their powers</a> were ugly. This trend was reduced with the introduction of the Morlocks, who were bizarre but kind, plus the general escalating public fear of mutants <em>because</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyLookLikeUsNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyLookLikeUsNow">they could look just like anyone else</a>.
</li><li> The first <em>X-Men</em> movie in many ways reflected this; the heroes were all extremely gorgeous people with cool powers played by people like Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and James Marsden, whilst the bad guys - with the notable exception of Ian McKellen - were all freaks. The later movies began to balance this out a bit more with the inclusion of characters such as Nightcrawler. Other X-Men films, such as <em>First Class</em> imply a number of evil mutants become evil <em>because</em> they're ugly; visible mutations make them bigger targets for prejudice, which in turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">makes them more cynical and bitter toward humans</a>.
</li><li> Also, some of the mutants who've wished to be cured over the years (and over the adaptations) have been mutants who looked human and didn't suffer from any lack of control.
</li><li> The X-man Beak became an interesting, fairly literal example. At first, he was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> since his only mutant power was looking like a giant plucked chicken. Than the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles">Exiles</a></em>' boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">The Timebroker</a> decides to draft Beak onto the team, and forcibly yank him away from his home reality. Why? Because Beak will supposedly save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a> some day. Essentially, the Timebroker just decided to hand Beak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">a great responsibility</a> while Beak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeSweetHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeSweetHome">just wanted his life back</a>, literally cursing him with awesomeness. Of course, the Timebroker turned out to be right when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Beak found a way to defeat Hyperion</span>.
</li><li> This point's been lampooned in Toyfare's <em>Twisted Toyfare Theater</em> comic, with a villain exclaiming "rich teenagers with superpowers? Yeah, I WISH I had your problems!"
</li><li> Inverted after M-Day which de-powered almost all the mutants. There is, for example, a home dedicated to helping mutants adjust to life without powers. One resident is a former telekinetic who used to use his powers for construction work.

He retorts it would be almost <em>impossible</em> for a straight man <em>not</em> to be turned on by her.

<ul><li> Deadpool was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">cursed by Loki to have Tom Cruise's face</a> until his father forgave him. Deadpool was not happy at all.

He eventually came to view it as just another form of ugliness.</span>
</li><li> Deadpool gets this again, in a sort of subversion. In Deadpool #64, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">curses him with immortality</span>. Where's the curse in that? Well, they both love Death, so Deadpool would actually be pretty happy being killable. Torn between Cursed With Awesome and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>— the curse only won out because that was Thanos's original intention.
</li></ul></li><li> Ironically enough, the literally Death-loving Thanos receives the immortality curse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThanosImperative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThanosImperative">The Thanos Imperative</a></em>, and he goes <em>completely omnicidally insane</em> as a result.

Of course, he is horrendously ugly by fire demon standards which makes him extremely handsome by human (or Asgardian) standards, but the Flame refuses to believe this.
</li><li> The Thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>. Super-strong &amp; nigh invulnerable. Sure he's not the best looking guy around, but despite this he's had several women attracted to him, Alicia Masters, Thundra, the second Miss Marvel, heck even Tigra seemed interested in him. Boo-hoo, poor Ben.
<ul><li> Although, this is pretty heavily subverted now. Ben doesn't hate his looks and is actually quite happy to be the "Ever-lovin' Blue-Eyed Thing", as it's brought him great success and many new friends.
</li><li> The most irrational thing he complained about was how he thought the first of these women would flee him if she were not blind. Dude, she has a pretty good idea that you are not normal-looking because your skin feels more like an <em>animate pile of rocks</em> than anything outwardly human.
</li><li> In fact, Alicia played a very big factor in him as a character early on. He doubted that she would fall for "plain old Ben" because she hadn't met him before he became the Thing, and tried <em>very</em> hard to resist his desire to become human again.
<ul><li> The Thing goes back and forth on the issue usually presenting himself as someone who has adjusted to the condition and enjoys the benefits, but sometimes something happens to remind him that not everybody accepts him.
</li></ul></li><li> The big issue comes from the fact that he inadvertably causes damage to structures around him. Buildings would have to be well-reinforced to support him and he probably wouldn't be able to take stairs or elevators. His fingers are too big and powerful to use normal, everyday things like telephones or cups, and everything in the Baxter Building had to be Thing-proofed just so he'd be able to live there. In terms of living his day-to-day life he's essentially handicapped.
</li><li> The Ultimate Universe version of the Thing has his condition played for full angst value but this is a younger version of the character. Aside from looking like a monster, he laments that he can't even figure out how to kill himself because he's too tough.
</li></ul></li><li> Thunderfoot, a homage to the character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em>, is cursed in the Vertigo comic book series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em> by a dark magician hare to change into a horrendous, disgusting form—that of a <em>human</em>—until he gets the love of a pretty doe (female hare). Actually, Thunderfoot is the most awesome lad the readers may have seen. Ever. But his attempts to woo lady hares are constantly thwarted by their fearful cries of "MONSTER! Monster!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HalloweenMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HalloweenMan">Halloween Man</a>, the eponymous hero of Drew Edwards' indie comic, is a pretty good example; though Solomon Hitch's "origin story" disfigured half his face and left him with a skeletal hand, he gains superhuman strength and agility, virtual immortality, and even vague psychic powers. In addition, his wealthy, attractive, and brilliant girlfriend Lucy and demigod best friend Ron (son of Dionysus) accept him without hesitation, even if many of the other, more "mainstream" heroes of Solar City do not. Subverted to an extent, as Halloween Man is still one of the undead and needs to gruesomely consume fresh organs from other monsters to maintain himself (rather than reverting to eating humans). It is also hinted that in at least some future time lines he flips to the dark side anyway, becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th">Jason Voorhees</a> type slasher.

</li></ul></li><li> In the comic <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Timespirits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Timespirits">Timespirits</a></em>, Our Heroes encounter a dinosaur-descended space pirate who has supernatural luck. She can never fail to do <em>anything</em> she tries. And when Our Heroes offer to remove the "Curse of Success" she jumps at the chance. Because, as she puts it, "I am so incredibly <em>bored</em>!". So she gets her luck extracted and has the ordinary chance of success and failure of anyone else - which she considers a blessing.
</li><li> This certainly happens to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>'s Dr. Manhattan. Being the only person with god-like powers in the entire known universe is a plus. But he lost his humanity, not really caring about anything but science. On the other hand, he doesn't care.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sillage">Sillage</a></em>. You would think that in a setting where everyone but the protagonist has psychic powers, to the point that she was not recognized as a person at first, might be a bad thing. Turns out it means she's an excellent spy/special agent, because she cannot be psychically detected like everyone else.

The fact that he cannot help but open any lock he's within a foot of no matter how foolhardy it is and how much he doesn't want to is a pretty big downside, but while it has mostly ruined his ability to hold a job it's also saved his life and others.

Gee, what a burden.
</li><li> For most folks who gain powers via Gamma radiation like the Hulk the Abomination, and General Ross, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">it's the opposite Trope</a> but there are exceptions:
<ul><li> The page picture's subject, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a>, started out as Bruce Banner's mousy cousin Jennifer Walters who transformed after being given a blood transfusion from Dr. Banner. She went from a shy, rather nebbish girl into... well, She-Hulk. Eventually, writers realized there weren't any real <em>downsides</em> to it, and she hasn't complained about the situation in <em>years.</em> (The trick is that, as the name implies, they were trying to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> - but while Bruce Banner turns into a horrific, mindless force of destruction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">most of the time</a>, Jennifer turns into a friendly, vivacious Amazon who is still mentally herself, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">tall, busty, and jacked</a>. Hard to see any downsides in that, especially since she didn't like who she used to be all that much to <em>begin</em> with.)
</li><li> Lampshaded as early as the late-80s, when at the end of an issue, Mr. Fantastic sadly informs Jennifer that due to a burst of radiation she absorbed, she is now permanently stuck in her She-Hulk form. A couple of beat panels later she replies, "So, what's the <em>bad</em> news?"
</li><li> Jen isn't the only one to benefit from gamma radiation. The Hulk's enemy the Leader was once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">nothing more than a janitor</a> until an accident involving gamma radiation turned him into a super-genius with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>. (He considered the green skin and enlarged, mutated cranium a <em>very</em> small price to pay.)
</li><li> Doc Samson transformed himself using stored energy siphoned from the Hulk in an attempt to turn the Hulk back into Bruce Banner permanently. Considering that it changed him from a somewhat nebbishy scientist into someone with the physique of a Greek god, the fact that it also made his hair longer and <em>green</em> was unplanned, but overall he admits it's still a good deal for him.
</li><li> Indeed, one theory about gamma radiation is that it transforms the victim into a physical embodiment of deeply repressed emotions. While the Hulk embodies the hidden rage that Bruce felt towards his abusive father, She-Hulk is a liberated, daring side of Jennifer that she had never been able to show before. Abomination is an unlovable bastard because Emil Blonsky is an unlovable bastard (or believes he is). Doc Sampson always wanted to be a paragon-style superhero, so that's what he turned into.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ROMSpaceknight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ROMSpaceknight">ROM and the other Spaceknights</a> constantly bewail the loss of their humanity, even though they can still think, talk, feel, and do pretty well everything else humans can, while also having supercool cyborg armor, the ability to fly, virtual immortality, and, of course, survive attack by the Dire Wraiths.
<ul><li> Not being able to get <em>out</em> of their armor probably sucks pretty hard. For one thing, you couldn't have sex. Actually, do there really have to be any other reasons?
</li><li> They also turned out to be <em>right</em> to bemoan their loss of humanity. A second generation of Space Knights was create which were more extremely transformed (and more powerful), and they all went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and destroyed the rest of their race and the parts removed from all the Space Knights, preventing anyone from ever transforming them back.
</li></ul></li><li> Zig Zagged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolves</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WerewolfByNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WerewolfByNight">Werewolf by Night</a></em>. At their creation, werewolves weren't "cursed" but merely given a useful ability; it later became a curse when the way to control those abilities got lost over time. So when Jack becomes a werewolf on his eighteenth birthday, it really is a curse: forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation">painfully transform</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdMoon">three times a month</a> with no control. But when he finally <em>does</em> learn how to control it, he starts to enjoy the abilities it gives him, being able to use his werewolf form to do good. Unfortunately, the curse seems to have a way of striking back. You can transform any time you want? Your uncontrolled werewolf form during the full moons will become stronger and more violent. You're happy you won't have to change <em>at all</em> anymore, not even during the full moon? You'll lose the ability, and from now on you'll be forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have visions of hell</span> when you transform.

<div class="indent">Obake. A subcategory of Yōkai, supernatural creatures of Japanese Shinto myth. Obake are beings that can take on any shape, from an inanimate household object to the most ravenous of beasts. However, despite that, Obake can be of various species, possessing various base forms; cat, dog, monkey, even human are just some of them. Obake have generally lived in peace, respecting all those around them. Secluding themselves from people, they are one with nature, in perfect harmony with it and each other as they live through existences which aren't limited by the passing of time.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Folklore </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In Christian folklore, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingJew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingJew">Wandering Jew</a> is ostensibly "cursed" with eternal—or at least unnaturally long—life for taunting Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion. Of course, this could double as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> from the Christian perspective: If the Wandering Jew truly is immortal, then no matter what good deeds he does to atone for his sinful act, he can never go to Heaven, since one must die in order to enter the afterlife.
<ul><li> However, without the curse, he would never have had time to repent, and he almost certainly would have gone to Hell. Sure, not being able to go to Heaven sucks, but between the choice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">"Live forever and never go to Heaven,"</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">"Go to Hell,"</a> he easily got a good deal. As Hell is (pretty much by definition) the worst possible thing, then even floating in an empty universe after it undergoes heat death would be a step up.
</li><li> Also, according to Christianity, the second coming will bring the kingdom of God anyways (with resurrection of the dead and so on.), so technically, it is not necessary to die, the guy just has to wait a bit longer.
</li></ul></li><li> According to legend, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThomasTheRhymer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThomasTheRhymer">Thomas The Rhymer</a> was captured by the Fairie Queen, and traded his ability to lie for his freedom.

<ul><li> The Groosalugg was cursed with unmatched combat skill. As he recounts his life's story to Cordelia, he talks about how his human heritage in the demon world of Pylea got him banished to the Scum Pits of Ur, meaning for him to die. Unfortunately, his awesome combat skills prevent him from dying honorably, as he destroys every one of his opponents, making him The Groosalugg, or undefeated champion.

<ul><li> Their main issue is with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Mundanes</a> hating them. According to the canon Psi-Corps trilogy, when the knowledge of telepaths first became public on Earth, it was followed by mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">Witch Hunts</a> for anyone who even seemed like they may be a telepath. This is despite the Pope (you know, the head of the largest religion on the planet) telling people that he approves of telepaths. The only time shown in the book where he is heeded is when an Italian mob boss lets a telepath go after cheating in his casino, provided he uses his gift to help him.
</li><li> To be fair, there is a lot about being a telepath in Babylon 5 that sucks. In order to keep from hearing the stray thoughts that everyone around them is constantly "shouting", one has to keep one's mind occupied with nursery rhymes, multiplication tables, anything and everything to generate "white noise" inside your own head. Because anything else is an invasion of privacy. Strong emotions are more difficult to block, so if someone's passionately intent on murder, you're going to hear it. And if you're hired to monitor a deal between two people, and one of them is preoccupied with "rather erotic" thoughts, well...

<ul><li> Similarly, McNair sees lycanthropy as a blessing rather than curse: "When bones break, they repair stronger, when skin tears, it heals tougher."
</li><li> Although in both cases, vampirism and lycanthropy <em>do</em> seriously suck, especially if you aren't prepared for it.

<ul><li> Sheldon is by far the most brilliant and was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a>. This, however, alienated him from his family and classmates and, as such, stunted his emotional development to the point where he has difficulty recognizing basic emotions in others. He's also stated that his eidetic memory causes him to not enjoy much of life because of the lack of challenge.
</li><li> Leonard was driven strongly by academic parents to succeed and became world-renowned as an experimental physicist. But he also was denied basic comfort and affection by his family and has great difficulty relating to women.
</li><li> Raj was brought up in great wealth surrounded by intense poverty. This privileged upbringing (probably caused by being surrounded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a> servants) causes him to not know how to act around people who aren't required to like him. The selective mutism around women probably came from somewhere in the same area once he had to get girls without his money.
</li><li> Howard's lack of relationship with his father and overbearing mother cause him to act out. He is by far the most outgoing and talkative of the main four but is often unaware of how much he is disliked. He also excelled in school in order to impress and bring pride to his mother. This costs him the ability to take care of his own life and he expects his mother (and later Bernadette) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">take care of him</a>.

<ul><li> Buffy, who is cursed to be a "hot chick with superpowers", as Faith once put it. The curse part is she has to use said superpowers to fight for her life every night, and the world's existence every late Spring. All Evil is waiting for is for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOnlyHasToWinOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOnlyHasToWinOnce">"one good day"</a> to fall on one where they can end the world. And statistically, she's ancient - most slayers die the same year they're chosen. At fifteen.
</li><li> In the episode "Nightmares", Buffy is temporarily turned into a vampire... which gives her the strength she needs to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>.

For the first three series they don't half go on about being spectacularly powerful witches (especially Piper) and are all somewhat inclined towards giving up their powers if given the chance (especially Piper...) in fact, they only stop complaining about their abilities (to freeze time or move things with their mind/astrally project or see into the future/levitate) in order to use them to save the day from demon of the week.
<ul><li> This may have more to do with the fact the writers set up the entire universe to ensure the sisters would never get to use their powers for anything besides demon-killing. Several episodes are centered around them trying to do something for themselves and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalGainHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalGainHurts">getting punished for it</a>.

</li><li> But some cry about it throughout the entire series. Such as Claire Bennet: her ability is regeneration, and she cries about it nearly all throughout season one, mourning how she's the freakshow of the cheerleaders, despite the fact that nobody except for a very select few friends and family knows about her ability, nor is her ability all that apparent unless she severely wounds herself in plain sight. Then in season two, it gets even worse, because she cries that she can't go around showing her ability and how restrained she feels. Never mind the fact that the only way to show her ability to others is by injuring herself. Never mind the fact that all she has to do in order to avoid suspicion is lay off her masochistic tendencies. Then she realizes the possibility of the company finding her, because they'll run tests on her and stuff, poking and prodding her. She cries about this too, even though it seems that's all she wants to do to herself; if you find an episode with Claire in it in the first two seasons that doesn't involve a suicide attempt or self mutilation, you get a cookie. And then in season three, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">loses the ability to feel pain</a>, and cries about that because it apparently takes all the fun out of self-mutilation.

On the other hand, House may just be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">brilliant ass</a>.

Liv is exceptionally resilient to injury; she can be shot and stabbed multiple times, she doesn't feel pain, she loses very little blood and the wounds eventually heal like they would for a normal person.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddleman">The Middleman</a></em> has a character who was cursed with immortality as a punishment for kicking someone else out of a lifeboat on the Titanic.

This also comes with a bent toward dark, murderous urges. That this <em>is</em> a curse is established in the Season 1 episode "Skin Deep", wherein <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Belle almost ends it with True Love's Kiss</span>. In a slight departure, while the show clearly wants us to see him as cursed, Rumpelstiltskin himself never complains about his powers, and is quite sensibly freaked out at the prospect of losing them and being at the mercy of the Evil Queen, not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing any chance of finding his son</span>.
<ul><li> The detrimental aspects are not emphasised as much, but the power of the Dark One is much like that of a djinn in that he has incredible power, but there is a magical item which grants the holder complete control over him (as well as the ability to take on the curse via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">You Kill It, You Bought It</a>). As long as he has the dagger, he can't be killed or controlled, but the curse also makes you prone to evil and the magic always comes with some kind of cost.

At first it seems like the devil owning Sam's soul looks like the best thing that's ever happened to him: he gets a cool job as a hunter of escaped souls, powers specially designed for each soul so he shouldn't have too much trouble with them, and the big guy's inside advice on how to get laid. However, the devil also occasionally screws with Sam's life just for the hell of it, and he can't say anything about it to the girl he really loves since it would jeopardize her ownership of her own soul.

<ul><li> There are a number of episodes when they <em>are</em> a detriment to him rather than a gift. There's the "zoning-out" problem, which nearly gets him run over by a truck in the pilot, when he focuses his vision too much on a flying frisbee. Also, after his ears get flushed out from all the wax build-up, his hearing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven">Turned Up to Eleven</a>, meaning he can't even focus at work thanks to all the tiny noises hitting him with the volume of a heavy metal concert. He's also extremely sensitive to pain, although Blair teaches him how to "dial it down" (specifically, using the "dial" imagery).
<ul><li> Funny thing is, it's never mentioned that the same super-sensitivity would also mean he would enjoy sex a <em>lot</em> more. Now imagine if two sentinels get it on...

Yep, an outsider with: two unbelievably loving parents, some awesome best friends who are totally supportive when they eventually learn his secret (and one's a hottie that's totally in love with him to boot), an acceptable level of baseline popularity in school, gets to looks like Tom goddamn Welling so most chicks think he's hot-as... oh and the small matter of developing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">wide array</a> of earth-shattering superpowers that make him a virtually unkillable demigod. He's not even superficially distinguishable from a human. Yeah, boo-frikkety-hoo, Clark; cry me a river... If it weren't for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">kryptonite</a> it would be win-win-win.
<ul><li> Admittedly, his whining becomes <em>slightly</em> more justified in later seasons as some people he loves die or move away, his would-be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OTP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OTP">OTP</a> starts getting really screwy, and increasingly more dangerous and determined adversaries are pitted against him. <strong>Still</strong>, you wish you could just tell him that a few years down the track he'll get the hot chick, be the universally beloved protector of the planet, hang out with a bunch of super buddies etc... SO JUST PUT A SOCK IN IT!

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, Teyla is understandably freaked out at first when she learns her telepathic abilities stem from the fact she's part Wraith. However, being a no-nonsense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>, she quickly comes to terms with her background and quickly sets out trying to figure how she can use it against the Wraith.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> The android Data is stronger than a Klingon, smarter than a Vulcan, doesn't need sleep or food or drink, can survive in open space or on any planet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">can interface with anything that moves</a> and doesn't have to worry about fear, sadness, hatred, or any other negative emotions, even if he's constantly the victim of racism. But, poor guy, all he wants is to be more human. And even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>, when he finally retrieves his emotion chip from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> brother, Lore, and it interferes with half of his regular operations, and makes him, frankly, a tool, he is still happy to hear LaForge say he's acting more human—in response to Data's chickening out and leaving LaForge in the hands of Dr. Soran and the Klingons. Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">next film</a>, Data gets enough control over his emotion function to turn it off when it gets in the way. Lampshaded by Q in one episode, where he points out a great many species spend millennia trying to be as close as they possibly can get to what Data is by default, as a way of pointing out how absurd his desire to be human is.
<ul><li> Star Trek tends to go in for this trope a lot. Odo in Deep Space 9 and Seven of Nine in Voyager are other examples of characters with cool abilities and immunities who go through lots of angst over the fact that they aren't the same as everyone else.
</li><li> Seven of Nine is perhaps an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>. Initially, she just wants to be a Borg again, since it's almost all she's ever known (she was assimilated as a young child). As the series progresses, she learns she can't go back, but doesn't entirely want to give up the positive things she's learned from the Borg (strive for efficiency and perfection). While she does set out to learn about and understand the positive aspects of humanity, she uses her differences in the best ways she can.

</li><li> Scott McCall from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em>. He doesn't see the awesomeness of lycanthropy when Derek Hale says the bite is a gift, arguing that being turned into a werewolf has made his life much more difficult and now he has to hide it from everyone around him. Justified at first by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>, but now he has full control and seems to have grown out of the angst. His best friend, Stiles Stilinski, rejects the bite later as well because of a similar reasoning and states that he's perfectly happy being a normal human.
</li><li> Although Captain Jack Harkness from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em> doesn't spend a lot of time bemoaning the fact that he can't die, he has clearly found the drawbacks to it, and there is a fair amount of subtext. He also has to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">watch almost all his friends, his lover, and at least one member of his family die</span>, then step up and fix everything anyway. He's sort of expected to be emotionless - not cold, just unable to be emotionally hurt or depressed. This, ironically, has got to be depressing.
</li></ul><ul><li> The Russian mini-series <em>Wolf Messing: Seeing through time</em>, based on the (possibly fictionalized) memoirs of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> psychic of that name, portray Messing's abilities alternatively as a gift and as a curse. It's all fun when he uses them on stage to read people's thoughts or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson">make them do something</a>. The pilot starts with Messing being asked a trivial question during a performance (which hockey team will win the championship), and he ends up getting a vision so disturbing (one of the hockey teams will die in a plane crash) that he cuts the performance short and immediately calls the Kremlin. He also gets horrible visions about the two World Wars before they happen. When a character later remarks about how great it would be to see bad things coming and change them, Messing points out that the bad things he sees are too grand to change by him alone. Even the plane crash still happens, despite him warning Stalin about it. Strangely, he is unable to foresee his own people being exterminated by the Nazis. He is also once asked to find a dead girl's body based on a photograph, and he visibly breaks down after touching the picture and revealing the location. When the cops ask if he'd like to help them full-time, he opts to be in the circus instead.

<ul><li> This depends on the player and character, for whom in some cases lycanthropy could ruin the character's access to powers or destroy the player's interest in the character by making him evil. However, many players enjoy playing this sort of brutal character and would not see it as a drawback at all. A player who is playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, however, would probably see almost no drawback to becoming a werebear.

Regarding werebears, they are still the good werebeasts, but the Monster Manual states that there are some evil ones. On the other hand, lycanthropes now have complete immunity to nonmagical weapons that aren't silver, and they have this regardless of what form they are in. This means that even a good aligned character could still put the "curse" to good use as long as they take the right precautions on the night of the full moon.

It's downright horrific. The GM is practically encouraged to have you one day wake up naked, covered in blood, with a horde of angry peasants brandishing pitchforks and an order of paladins hunting you down. The player does not control his character during his transformed states and has no idea what he did while changed.
</li><li> D&amp;D 4e has the ability for player characters of level 11 or higher to transform into a lich, provided they have the money to cast the ritual. Oh, truly this is a horrible curse... which bestows the caster with almost doubled hit points, powerful regeneration, immunity to disease and poison, a significant bonus to all defences, and the ability to reconstruct yourself from a phylactery if killed. And there's no gradual drift towards evil in the gameplay mechanics, either. Why shouldn't the PCs try this again?

</li><li> Up to 3rd Edition, a drow was turned into a drider (a centaur-like creature that was the upper-body of a drow and a giant black widow spider from the waist down) by their dark goddess Lolth as a punishment for failing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage">Rite of Passage</a>. Exactly why Lolth would turn one of her subjects into a likeness of herself and make them stronger in the process (letting them keep their divine spellcasting ability too if they happened to be clerics) <em>did</em> seem a little strange, and in the 4th edition, this was changed via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a>, making driders a privileged caste bestowed on drow as a reward. In 5th edition, however, this was changed back, playing this trope straight again.
<ul><li> Well, there <em>is</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation">agonizing transformation</a>, plus your mind gets wiped in the process. It's not exactly <em>fun</em>.
</li><li> For a while, the idea was that driders got 'stuck' — that is, they got powerful new abilities, but since they were now monsters they couldn't get class levels, so while vastly more powerful than the overwhelming majority of drow they weren't <em>quite</em> as powerful as the most powerful drow (Drow society pushing being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">The Social Darwinist</a>, this was a valid reason for Driders to be looked down at). The problem came in when edition changes made it possible for driders to gain class levels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">without changing the drider/drow relationship in settings that had been around before 3E</a>...

Some of the more munchkin-prone players enjoy picking "drawbacks" that may lack a certain sting.

(The other half is taking their stuff afterwards.)
<ul><li> Starts to lean a little more toward the "cursed" side of the equation if the character in question loses his ability to discern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe">friend from foe</a> in their rage-frenzy and winds up attacking their own allies.

</li></ul></li><li> Some players have turned some 'cursed' items to their advantage, embracing this trope. The greatest example was the classic D&amp;D Sword -1 Cursed, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">Clingy MacGuffin</a> which would, no matter what you did to get rid of it, would reappear in your hand when combat began. Many did not see a disadvantage of dealing with a -1 penalty for a weapon which was always available. This would eventually make an appearance in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> novels in the hands of a villain.
<ul><li> This is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/NinjaBurger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/NinjaBurger">Ninja Burger</a></em>, where the cursed item card has no drawback, and means the "cursed" item can now never be stolen or destroyed.
</li><li> Another cursed sword (which makes an appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>) actually gets a bonus to hit and damage to encourage people to use it. When practicing with it, there's no problem. When anyone attacks you, it causes you to go berserk and kill anyone in the vicinity, only calming down some time after all attackers are dead or have fled. In theory, this is a curse because of the risk of hurting your allies, but in practice, there are ways around this, and it may very well be your best available weapon if you're going the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> route.
<ul><li> Similarly, the 3.5 DMG goes so far as to list a sword that enrages the user as being boon or bane, depending on the wielder's own views. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/cursedItems.htm#swordBerserking">Seen here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> A Necklace of Strangulation chokes to death anyone who puts it on. It sounds like a horrible item to find. No one says you have to wear it. No one says you can't, say, bribe an enemy with it. Oops. There are many similarly wicked items enterprising players can abuse.
</li><li> Another classic example is the Bag of Devouring, a cursed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a> that tries to swallow anyone who reaches inside it. Many players are quick to see the potential in a portable garbage disposal. The general consensus is that any player who can't find a use for a "cursed" item isn't trying hard enough.
<ul><li> Which is why the DM Guide warns the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster">Dungeon Master</a> to never assume that players will "automatically" discard cursed items on realizing their status. It even gives an example - Dust of Sneezing and Choking, which does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, can do it to either the owner... or those orcs over there that just had it thrown over their heads. (The item is only "cursed" because it looks almost identical to Dust of Disappearance, which makes you invisible, and tracks as such when identifying it.)
</li><li> In the rules for randomly generating cursed items one possible curse means the item does the opposite of what it's meant to do. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">books themselves mention that this isn't necessarily a bad thing</a>, as a wand of "healing" that instead hurts people could be useful as a weapon.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>, each domain—a subsection of the plane—is ruled, at least in part, by a darklord, an incredibly evil individual, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">not always an unsympathetic one</a>. They get all sorts of shiny powers out of the deal, but it also earns them a curse—which, in and of itself, is personally tailored to the person so that, it wouldn't be so bad for anyone else, but the darklord's personality makes it so that it becomes unberable.
<ul><li> The demon lord Baphomet, who was supposedly either a human or an animal (presumably a bull, given his minotaur links) "cursed" to be a super-powerful demon lord ruling an entire layer of the Abyss and building his own monsters.
</li></ul></li><li> Given that the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> has the Immaculate Order, an entire religion devoted to demonizing the Celestial Exalted, it's entirely possible for a Solar or Lunar with Immaculate sympathies to view having become an incredibly powerful demigod as a curse. (Terrestrials are venerated by the Order, and Sidereals a) have been forgotten by most of Creation, including the Order, and b) are recruited, trained, and disabused of any inaccurate notions about Exaltation and the world in general within days of the Second Breath.)
<ul><li> Sidereals have to deal with Arcane Fate... a unique astrological phenomenon that causes any being not Sidereal or in the employment of the Bureau of Destiny to gradually forget that they exist. While this is a grand boon to their ability to operate as covert agents (especially since they can 'invent' cover identities that are unaffected by Arcane Fate), it likewise means that if they don't watch their step, critical allies and loved ones will forget they ever existed.
</li></ul></li><li> If you're <em>really</em> lucky in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, you'll end up like this. Example: The closest thing to retirement a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> might ever get is having their mangled, mortally wounded body put on life support and encased in a Dreadnought, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">heavily armed walking tank</a>, for <em>thousands of years</em>. Getting to blow shit up from beyond the grave, and sleeping the rest of the time, seems pretty cool.
<ul><li> There's one tale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orks</a> tell of a warband that ventured into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">the Eye of Terror</a>, ending up on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">demon world</a> where they were all slaughtered... only to be raised again every morning to keep fighting, for the Blood God. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Orks consider this</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">heaven</a></em>.
</li><li> The Eldar have an unusual version of this. In order to keep their emotions under control they dedicate themselves to a single career (called a Path), mastering that before leaving it behind and moving onto something else. However occasionally an Eldar will become "stuck" on a particular path and be unable to switch. The downside is that when this happens they risk losing control of themselves, the upside is they become VERY, VERY good at it. In particular Eldar who have become stuck on the path of either the Warrior or the Witch (called Exarchs and Farseers) are the leaders of Eldar society.
</li><li> Psykers in general in the setting. While it ranges from people being able to control their power to ones who would just implode and take half the city with him, most of them have some pretty awesome powers. Alpha-class human psykers are said to be able to destroy titans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that would make a Gundam look tiny in comparison, by crushing it with their minds. The aforementioned Farseers are able to see into the future and manipulate the strains of fate, but are otherwise cursed to crystallize slowly over time, becoming one with their own craftworlds.
</li><li> On the other end of the spectrum, Necrons also suffer from a case of this. They're more or less immortal (it's hinted that not a single Necron has ever permanently died, only to be reduced to atoms then teleported to a nearby tomb for repairs), possess strength on par with Space Marines or more, and have guns that strip you one molecule at a time to your bare bones. Necron Lords are even hinted to have sentience, and are able to command legions of his brethren. The cursed part? You're an antithesis to all living beings in the known universe and bar the select individuals (Lords) many Necrons no longer have sentience.
</li><li> The Primarch Ferrus Manus killed a silver dragon in a lava flow and the dragon's metallic skin fused to his arms, covering them with living metal. With his iron hands he could forge weaponry by working the metal with his 'bare' hands and never needed gauntlets in battle, since his hands were already invulnerable. His Space Marines, the Iron Hands legion, have developed a habit of intentionally replacing parts of themselves with cybernetic augmentations in homage to him. However, Ferrus didn't like his metal arms, precisely <em>because</em> they were so useful. In his opinion, he is being made weaker by depending on them and had decided that after the wars were over he would strip the metal off his arms, reassert his own strength and curb his legion's reliance on machine parts. Sadly, he was killed in battle before that could happen and the Iron Hands have gone on trying to fix their 'weakness of the flesh'.
</li><li> The Obliterators embody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> by being a perfect mix of man, demon and machine. It begins with contracting the Obliterator virus, melding with your firearm, generating ammunition for your firearm, developing the ability to absorb other firearms and finally becoming a full-fledged Obliterator. The awesome part is how Obliterators are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">Walking Armory</a> incarnate, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a> and the capability to produce and wield any weapon for any situation.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the "curses" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PalladiumFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PalladiumFantasy">Palladium Fantasy</a></em> give the character bonuses. For example, Glowing Red Eyes gives you a bonus to intimidation, and Frog Legs allow you to jump great distances.
</li><li> Some cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> have effects that <em>look</em> bad, but can be abused with certain combos. The poster child of this trope, however, is probably <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mist_Valley_Falcon">Mist Valley Falcon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He can be summoned at no cost, and has a whopping 2000 ATK, which is as high as it gets without drawbacks. The "cursed" part? He can't use that high ATK score without returning one of your cards to your hand. The "awesome" part? Try equipping <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Bang_Shot">Big Bang Shot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to one of your <em>opponent's</em> monsters before attacking. Yes, you get a powerful attack, <em>and</em> you get to kill one of your opponent's monsters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>! He can also return a <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fiendish_Chain">Fiendish Chain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that you want to use again. That's <em>saving a card</em>. The best part? His effect can be used to trigger <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_Wind_of_Mist_Valley">Divine Wind of Mist Valley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, allowing you to summon something like resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Reborn_Tengu">Reborn Tengu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> An even more notorious example is <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Imperial_Order">Imperial Order<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the only continuous spell negation trap in the game. Its intended downside is that it has a maintenance cost that you have to pay 700 life points during each of your standby phases or it's destroyed. This, however, wound up giving the person using it the option to cancel its effect before their turn really starts, allowing them to play their spell cards when they want to after denying the opponent the chance to play theirs. As spell cards are an important resource to the game (especially in spell based decks), this card gave a massive strategic advantage to the person playing it, resulting in the card being banned.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has the Oracle class, divine spellcasters who all are cursed with disabilities. The good news is, these curses come with matching benefits, which get more powerful as you level.
</li><li> Accepting a Geist into your head in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Geist: The Sin-Eaters</a></em> means having a near-demonic old ghost bound to you for the rest of your life and having to put up with seeing ghosts. On the other hand, you get all sorts of cool necromantic powers and, most importantly, if you hadn't accepted the "curse"? You'd be plain old dead. So, naturally, Sin-Eaters tend to see themselves as this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. Hell, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline">Tagline</a> is "A Storytelling game about Second Chances." It's by far the most optimistic game in the setting (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">though admittedly, that's a pretty low bar.</a>)
</li><li> The Accursed (subtle!) and Wounded Angel arcs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChuubosMarvelousWishGrantingEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChuubosMarvelousWishGrantingEngine">Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine</a></em> provide a mixture of neat benefits and unpleasant drawbacks. Wounded Angel relies upon developing physical and mental injuries of various kinds, then gaining powers based on those, while caging something horrible that gets let out if you run out of Divine Health Levels; Leonardo de Montreal, the Wounded Angel pregen, has powers like ripping out his heart to make himself a being of heartless perfection in the dark (it doesn't work in the light because his heart may or may not be fuelling the replacement sun - it's complicated), and holds in that space a nightmare known as the Red World. Accursed, meanwhile, involves becoming imbued with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">Power of the Void</a> until you can erase things from reality, but at the same time reality itself is prone to some kind of backlash against you...
<ul><li> The tumblr arc <a class="urllink" href="http://jennamoran.tumblr.com/post/136905972668/indomitable-1-of-2">Indomitable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> literally spells out its Curse as something that <em>would be</em> a more legitimate Curse except that it doesn't seem to have any actual drawbacks for you (and there's even a power that lets you inflict the drawbacks on other people).

<ul><li> The downside of the curse isn't directly the immortality. It's the fact that Jason feels so miserable he'd be suicidal, and CAN'T KILL HIMSELF to escape from it. Quick recap: the reason Merlin curses him is that he breaks his oaths of loyalty by betraying his fellow knights in order to be with the woman he (thinks he) loves, Morgan Lefay. She, in turn, promptly reveals she was just using him to give her son Mordred a shot at the throne. So basically, he murdered all his friends to be with a woman who thinks he's little more an inconvenience. You'd probably feel pretty sucky, too.

<ul><li> This later came back to bite him in the boney butt later on in the series when a new disease managed to "shove them through the door" and he suddenly found out how mortal he really was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out it was his hatred and malice keeping him alive all these years, and he blissfully went back to the way he was, much to the chagrin of the rest of the town.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the Treehouse Of Horror episode "A Costume To Your Face", a witch punishes the town by cursing them to become their costumes after they refuse to let her win the costume contest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">as she wasn't technically in costume</a>. Of course, for people like Marge (A skeleton), Disco Stu (Steve Martin Arrow), or Hans Moleman (A mole, and also not a costume) it's a true punishment, but people like Bart (Wolfman), Sideshow Mel (Spiderman), or Milhouse (Muscular construction worker) ended up enjoying their "fate" and not wanting to be changed back.

The worms then built a metropolis in his bowels and began overhauling his entire body, bringing him to a level of peak mental and physical capabilities. Everybody <em>else</em> treats this like a horrible affliction and resolves to remove his worms, but Fry thinks this is the best thing that's ever happened to him.
<ul><li> Incidentally the application of this trope also explained why no one else was eating bathroom sandwiches. Everyone <em>thinks</em> having worms is bad so the "affliction" is gotten rid of before anyone realizes it's a good thing.
</li><li> Really, the main reason it's treated like a curse by everyone else is that they just think having worms live inside you is too gross. They know about the benefits as they watch the worms mend a hole THROUGH HIS TORSO in seconds and see all the internal changes first hand. Leela spends time with Fry and falls in love with him because of how much they improve him. In the end, Fry sees them as a curse only because he can't tell if Leela loves him for him or for what the worms have made him.

Fluttershy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a>, is cursed with an unfitting deep voice, making talking even more awkward for her than usual. This becomes useful in the season four episode "Filli Vanilli", when her deepened voice let her stand in for Big Macintosh in an acapella quartet.

Being young and beautiful forever is something that many people through the ages in real life would drink potentially toxic elixirs in order to achieve. And all they had to do was overuse their powers. Since they're REALLY not 17, they don't have the age-related drawbacks, either. Not that it'd matter, since they could make their own alcohol, tobacco, porn, you name it, even if they weren't legally allowed to buy it. One of its draw backs however, is they can't get any real jobs that require someone to be at least 20 years old, and they were stuck working in a restaurant just to earn their own money.

They never die young and always live several years past the U.S. male life expectancy. What a terrible fate! It becomes even sillier when Arnold notices that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he did the math wrong; his predecessors died when they were <em>91</em></span>.

At first, Rudolph's red nose and Hermey's talent for dentistry make both of them "misfits", but Rudolph's nose is what saves the day at the end (and is a convenient light source), while Hermey's talent saves his friends from the Abominable. The Misfit Toys have this too. Apparently, at least <em>one</em> child in the world would love to have a toy cowboy that rides an ostrich or a choo-choo with square wheels on its caboose.

This only serves to make Skullnick even crabbier... until in the episode "Interdimensional Field Trip", where she learns more about trolls and the advantages that come with her new form, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">a lifespan as long as four centuries</a>.

She especially takes advantage of this when her (presumably) first Yaksha gets destroyed by the ligers and soon gets replaced with another one because in the same episode, she has the luck of encountering a man who loves her and tricks him into saying that three times. Another upside is that if a Yaksha stops loving Sonia, it turns back into its original self. This means that Sonia will always know who is merely infatuated with her, and who loves her unconditionally.
<ul><li> Yaksha is cursed to lose its original form and be stuck as this monster. A monster with an incredibly durable elastic body, that makes it a huge asset in battle. Not to mention all the time Yaksha spends cuddling with the woman it loves.

</li><li> With neurosyphilis, a recurrence of syphilis when latent <em>Treponema</em> bacteria start attacking the brain, it causes euphoria in its victims. They become more sexually active, happier, and more passionate. Because syphilis isn't very common anymore, this usually happens in old people. Now, you can imagine how being old and suddenly regaining your sex drive is unusual. A substory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> was inspired by this. That, in turn, was inspired by a real case study done by Oliver Sacks, which he wrote about in <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</em>. This 89 year old woman had been a prostitute in turn of the century Greece and contracted syphilis when she was 20. Since there was no treatment at the time, the spirochetes became latent and only affected her 70 years later. She started feeling horny for the first time in years, and sleeping with younger men. Her fellow prostitutes had nicknamed it "Cupid's Disease" (brothels should know a thing or two about STDs). Sure enough, when they tested her CSF, it was positive for neurosyphilis. And just like in <em>House</em>, the old woman wasn't sure if she wanted it treated. But she didn't have to worry. Her brain had been permanently "damaged," so the spirochaetes could be killed without reversing the mild disinhibition. In House's words, she was "cursed to feel happy".
</li><li> In the late 1940s Harry Corbett used to play the piano in a band. Then he started going deaf (he was eventually cured by an operation).

It consists of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphia">hypergraphia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a tendency to have heightened emotional and mental life and decreased sexual interest, and an inclination towards spirituality. Sure, seizures aren't fun, but the rest of it? Many writers would give anything to spend more time in that mindstate, especially the hypergraphia. Low sex drive is not much of a problem, you only lack the "urge" to mate like 99% of the rest of the population, but you can appreciate sex physically as much as everyone else... You are also much less likely to do stupid things (although, low sex drive can be a symptom of another problem such as depression or a hormone imbalance. It would be wise to double-check.)
</li><li> The religious hierarchy of Egypt was so angry at King Tut's father for trying to switch to a monotheistic system that they did their best to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">completely erase any history that his son ever ruled</a>. They were so successful that the tomb was only robbed twice months after the burial, the first of which stole limited items and the second of which the robbers were caught and the items returned.

On the other side, their relationships and self-control can become really serious issues, with a chance they end up putting themselves or others in danger.
</li><li> Russia is a vast country with extremely cold winters, two factors which drive up transport and living costs, and generally cause life in Russia to be an even greater pain. However, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Wars</a>, the vastness of Russia and the coldness of her winters played merry hell with the invaders' logistics - they were far more dependent on railways and, unlike the Russians, they didn't have enough horses to keep their troops fed and supplied properly over the massive distances involved.
<ul><li> Not just during the World Wars. People with eyes on Russia like the Teutonic Knights and Napoleon Bonaparte also got caught up in the winters, to the point that it was almost expected for a Russian Army to used a Scorched-Earth strategy - wherein they'd evacuate and then raze all the villages in the invaders' path <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">to keep them hungry and exposed to the elements</a>. Napoleon's failed invasion is considered (one of) his greatest failure(s). The Nazis also suffered this, and Hitler expected them to keep on going and not retreat. It's not for nothing that Russia's winter is sometimes nicknamed "General Frost" or "General Winter."
</li><li> Same applies to Finland. But also skiing or snowmobiling through the snowy wilderness in winter is far faster than walking or hiking through them in the summer, and the extremely difficult road conditions in the winter makes Finns skillful car and motorcycle drivers. <em>If you wanna win, get a Finn</em> is an old adage in motor sports. Many car manufacturers do their development work in Finland due to the Finnish winter and road conditions in wintertime.
<ul><li> Russian Lada had (and has still) an excellent reputation as a reliable winter car in Finland. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">generally not liked</a>, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">respected</a>. It can be said Lada itself was cursed with awesome - the properties which made it a good winter car made it awful to drive in other seasons.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Suspension with pay. You don't need to (in fact you can't) go to work, but you still get paid. Along the same vein, suspension from school: most kids hate school anyway, so you're going to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment">punish</a>" them with a couple of days off? Great! Some schools have gone to "in-school suspension" (basically all-day detention) to counteract this, but this also fails because students aren't really forced to work. For those that do take the time to work, they're able to do so at their own pace since they're not at the mercy of period bells.
</li><li> Shows with a small or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a>. Yeah, you may not get the best special effects or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> of a better funded show, but by the same tokens, the writers realize this, and you oftentimes can get a show that's better written and better produced. The producers of <em>Supernatural,</em> the old series of <em>Doctor Who</em> and the British <em>Being Human</em> have all mentioned working on somewhat small budgets (especially for a sci-fi series) forced them to get creative and put more effort into quality instead of spectacle.
<ul><li> Good Indie titles are the Video Game version.
</li><li> Adversity forces creativity.

Many many classic movies had similar situations, where a unique solution to a budget issue became the most memorable part of the film.

Since Marvel Studios didn't have access to its top-tier superheroes like Spider-Man or the X-Men when the franchise began in 2008, they had to work with B-list heroes, which gave the studio more creative freedom in reimagining and altering the characters without having to live up to pre-existing expectations by the public. Furthermore, the lesser-known reputation of these heroes forced the writers to focus more on making the characters relatable instead of relying just on brand name recognition.
</li><li> Certain types of synesthesia. Most people who have it describe it as a sixth sense that allows them to memorize things like formulas and phone numbers better than the average person as well; some who perceive sounds as colors have composed music by literally looking at it without the aid of sheet music. The downside? You're basically constantly hallucinating and describing your experiences to someone who isn't familiar with your particular manifestation of synesthesia makes you sound <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">like you just transferred in from Wonderland.</a> Of course, there's also the fact that it cannot be controlled.

They aren't fun to go to movies with, and suffer from anxiety often, but anyone who's ever been fired for repeated tardies knows that it's not without its benefits.
</li><li> Some people with bipolar disorder refuse to take medication for their condition, preferring the roller-coaster to a blandly-unpleasant existence of mild sedation and other drug side-effects.
</li><li> Super tasters. They have too many taste buds and as a result, they cannot enjoy delicious foods. But this forces them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItTastesBadItMustBeGoodForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItTastesBadItMustBeGoodForYou">actually enjoy healthy foods</a>. YMMV though, since certain healthy foods can be overbearing while less healthy ones with less complex flavors will be preferred.
</li><li> Single people. While a relationship can be a good thing for a person, it can also be bad. Very, very bad. So while single people may feel lonely at times (and may even be ridiculed by others!) they have more freedom, less worry/drama, more focus on goals, no worries about fidelity/exclusivity/trust, etc. relative to people in romantic relationships. All this can apply to virgins as well: there can be no surer protection against STDs and unwanted pregnancies than not having sex!
</li><li> Some people require a lot of stimulation to orgasm, or simply can't climax at all. This can make it difficult if not impossible to use masturbation to 'blow off steam' and relax, and it can also foster feelings of inadequacy in one's partners - who may feel they are 'to blame' for you not climaxing. But on the plus side you may well be able to work up to a very, <em>very</em> high plateau of sexual pleasure - the kind most might only be able to reach for a moment before climaxing. And then stay there. In some cases, for <em>hours</em>. Cursed with awesome indeed.
</li><li> Human biology states that wisdom teeth should grow in, but some people have a hereditary condition that prevents this from occurring. While this is technically a genetic defect, it only works to one's favor in an era of modern dental hygiene.
</li><li> Working weekends. While any shift that requires this does not seem desirable, it has a large advantage that most don't realize unless they've done it: If your days off are normal business days, this means you have days off when everything is open and you can get errands done far easier and at less of an inconvenience to your normal schedule. It also allows one to go shopping at stores that are open 7 days but are far busier on weekends and beat the crowds. You can actually get far more done on your days off.
<ul><li> The same with working the night shift or early morning. Many radio hosts, for example, only work when doing their show, and then spend the rest the day doing whatever they want.
<ul><li> Some private schools require you to work on Saturdays, but because of this, the days off you normally would have are added to your holidays. For instance, in UK schools that do this you would get nine weeks summer holiday instead of six, plus extra weeks at Christmas and Easter too. You get a great feeling of vindication when people from other schools have to go back to school when you have several more weeks of holiday left. That's not to say it's not frustrating to lose your full weekend though.
</li></ul></li><li> Many computer programmers prefer working the night shift because it offers fewer distractions.
</li><li> If where you work is a non-trivial commute from home, working at night and on weekends can have the benefit of not having to deal with the horrendous rush hour traffic.
</li></ul></li><li> Some guy on twitter tried to threaten women with the "curse" of not dating them. Which led to this hilarious five-act play by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnScalzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnScalzi">John Scalzi</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/09/25/an-anti-feminist-walks-into-a-bar-a-play-in-five-acts/">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> There are quite a few people with high metabolisms that wish they could actually pack on the pounds. This is despite them being able to eat as much as they want without gaining any weight, and svelte people being generally considered quite attractive (to the point where there's many a model who's little more than skin and bones).
</li><li> Poets/Writers/artists who've had horrible lives. In return of a lifetime of suffering (losing their parents very early, starvation, disease, etc.), they write far better works than ones whose lives were happier. A good example is Attila József, a young Hungarian poet whose father abandoned the family when he was three years old and mother died nine years later, ended up in the psychiatric ward, and died when he was crushed by a train. Still he wrote beautiful and amazing poems that were even melodized by some punk bands. Though some of them only get their appreciation they deserve after they die.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amtrak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amtrak">Amtrak</a> does not run any high speed lines outside the Northeast Corridor due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">lackluster federal funding</a>, forcing it to take winding routes through mountainous terrain - giving train-riders among the best views you can get on any trip in the world. Few railroads in the world offer so much "the journey is the destination" as Amtrak does. However, it can also become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> as Congress does not see tourism and sightseeing as something the federal government should spend money on.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2no4d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2no4d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2no4d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Never mind all that tourism and sightseeing does wonders for local economies, or that Congress can always somehow find money for highways, airports, and cruise ship terminals.</span>
</li><li> This turned out to be the case with Secretariat, considered the greatest race horse of all time. After his death an autopsy revealed that his heart was freakishly much larger than your average horse, and almost certainly the result of a genetic mutation, however this enlarged heart's ability to pump much more blood is the primary reason for his speed.
</li><li> Some people with Kallman Syndrome as told in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1852-6-awful-ways-life-changes-when-you-never-go-through-puberty.html">this Cracked article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. When the male recipients are too late to be treated, their semen can be infertile and are subjects for their kids' look. Yet the male recipients will not go bald much later than normal men treated or not. And hey, if they are treated they still have their youth for some time and their voice wouldn't crack.
</li><li> Small-name creators may not be making enough from what they produce for entertainment for it to be their main job, but they generally enjoy better relations with their fans (due to not being flooded with constant fan messages), are more likely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">do what they do out of passion</a> rather than just to make money, and don't have to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">downsides of being super-famous</a> such as constant public scrutiny.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome">Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a condition where a woman is born effectively genetically male on the inside, yet still developed female genitalia and hormones. It leaves any recipient lacking reproductive organs and completely infertile. However the way it affects body development means that women with it <a class="urllink" href="https://jenapincott.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/when-the-perfect-woman-is-genetically-male/">often end up absolutely gorgeous.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Underachieving students in school, who have to struggle and work hard to get marks. Once they're out of school and likely pursuing a career that doesn't require a high level of academic prowess, they're likely to find themselves excelling purely on the work ethic they developed.
</li><li> People in small or obscure cities may lose out when it comes to things to do around town or participating in big-name events (such as concerts of popular musicians) that are only held in bigger cities that people actually care about, but one of their perks is that where they live is less likely to be flooded by tourists who crowd places or disrespect the local culture.
</li><li> Having an eidetic memory, sure it's of great use when you're revising or remembering the most important things. However, you are going to be stuck with bad, cringey or even traumatic memories as well. An eidetic memory works both ways.
</li><li> Heterochromia can be either this <em>or</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>. Most people think it looks cool, and it usually doesn't have any side effects. In some cases though (depending on the cause)it can cause vision problems or be indicative of another health issue.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobbieWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobbieWilliams">Robbie Williams</a> is quite possibly the most famous solo male pop singer alive, having sold 75 million records since leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakeThatBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakeThatBand">Take That</a> in 1997, but the price of his fame is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">he has never been successful in the United States</a>, having only a few minor hits in the US despite being a juggernaut everywhere else. But rather than seeing this as a career frustration, Williams takes advantage of it by making his home in the US—Los Angeles specifically—since it's the only place in the world where he can live anonymously and give his family a normal life.
</li><li> ADHD and ADD helps with some things in life, but unless the circumstamces are already in your favour they may not be of any use.
<ul><li> To compensate for the short attention span, many ADHD individuals develop the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a> — but this also makes it harder to focus on any one thing, since they cannot filter out the very details they use to scan everything.
</li><li> Hyperfocus diverts all brain power on a single thing, which allows for faster learning... but cannot be triggered at will, usually only happens if the subject is already interesting, you'll be less aware of your surroundings/needs and can be a massive time sink. For example, one may come up with an idea for a project at 4pm, starts doing it and realizes at 4am they haven't eaten anything for the last 14 hours, they've been postphoning a bathroom break for 3 hours and have screwed up their schedule.
