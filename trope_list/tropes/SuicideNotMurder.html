<ul><li> As pictured above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> users this more than once:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> Yoko Okino's ex-boyfriend committed suicide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpurnedIntoSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpurnedIntoSuicide">casts suspicion on her</a>, but Conan clears her.
</li><li> Another case alluded to was when the ex-CEO of a company committed suicide and tried to frame his former business partner, only to be found out by Conan's father Yusaku. Years later, his son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide">tried the opposite</a> and was foiled by Conan himself.
</li><li> In the backstory for the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Detectives Koshien</span> mini-arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a rich and mentally unstable young lady from Fukuoka hung herself in her mansion. Due to a thief's meddling, her butler's silence about it <em>and</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">Amateur Sleuth</a>'s mistaken deductions, the case was mistakenly filed as murder and her handmaid was blamed for it. The poor maid threw herself into the sea in despair, and her best friend (another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">Amateur Sleuth</a>) created the whole <em>Detective Koshien</em> deal to find and punish the people who drove the girl to her death.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When a male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> hung himself a few days before he was about to make a huge comeback, his ex-girlfriend and now-manager decided to plant evidence that pointed more to a murder. She did it because they shared a very sad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> that would come to the surface if the press dug into his possible reasons to kill himself, so making people think he'd been killed would distract them.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13">Golgo 13</a>: The Professional</em> has a weird version of this. The film starts with a powerful man's son being killed by Golgo 13. At the end, we learn that the son had hired Golgo to kill him - he felt he could never live up to his father's expectations, but was too squeamish to kill himself.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the "The Too Many Cooks Caper" in <em>Detective Comics #500</em>, where a dying detective fakes his own murder at his retirement dinner, causing the other detectives at the dinner to go after the mobster he framed for the crime.
<ul><li> This story was based on the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> story "The Case Batman Failed To Solve!!!" from <em>Batman</em> #14 (December 1942-January 1943). The scenario is essentially the same but with Batman as one of the detectives present. Batman solves the case but doesn't disclose the solution to allow the dead detective Dana Drye's mystique to remain intact.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Joker's final joke is to frame Batman for his own death. Batman <em>did</em> break Joker's spine, but didn't go through with murder as he originally intended - Joker then taunts him and laughs as he <em>snaps his own neck despite being paralyzed</em>. Sure enough, the police believe Batman broke his code and killed the Joker.</span>
</li><li> The opening scene of Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ruse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ruse">Ruse</a></em> miniseries has Simon Archard declare a nobleman's death suicide, not murder, despite the fact that he was stabbed several times in the stomach and his <em>head was cut off</em>. He cited evidence such as a lack of defensive wounds, the discoloration of the man's skin and blood, a faint but distinctive odor, and ink stains on his hands — which indicate that he hastily wrote a suicide note and did the deed with cyanide, after which the first person to discover the body staged it as a murder to avoid scandal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em> has an interesting play on this when Myndi Mayer commits suicide and is subsequently shot by a man intending to kill her without realizing she was already dead. It takes a while for the whole of the story to be revealed, and the fact that she was already dead before being shot is learned before the motives of her shooter.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TurnaboutStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TurnaboutStorm">Turnabout Storm</a></em>. Ace Swift did get himself killed, but it was entirely by accident. He'd left a gap in his lightning-proof suit while trying to blackmail Rainbow Dash into losing the upcoming race. As Ace flew up towards a cloud later, he was struck with a lightning bolt in the exposed spot, causing his own death.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhereTalentGoesToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhereTalentGoesToDie">Where Talent Goes To Die</a></em>. The fifth murder victim is found drowned in the baths, and some suspect that it was a suicide, but there are a number of points indicating that it was murder- the victim's arms and legs were bound, there was a chloroform-soaked rag near the scene, and the victim, being a Christian, believed that committing suicide would send her to Hell. It ultimately turns out that the victim allowed the killer to kill her since Monokuma was threatening to harm the students' families if a murder didn't occur soon.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Film </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the original ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalAttraction">Fatal Attraction</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> slits her own throat to try and make it look like the man she'd been dallying with had done it to get rid of her.
<ul><li> Actually, that likely wasn't her intent, since she sent him an audiotape warning that she felt suicidal. It's implied that this tape would get him out of jail. But then, she may have been too crazy to think things through.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a movie called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CookiesFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CookiesFortune">Cookie's Fortune</a></em>, where the old lady killed herself and left her fortune to one of the other characters... and her daughter was the first one to discover her, and so scandalized by the idea that she would have killed herself, and that people would think ill of the family for it, that she planted evidence to make it seem like murder, which led to a series of events that ended in a very just ending.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeaveHerToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeaveHerToHeaven">Leave Her to Heaven</a></em>, the insanely jealous Ellen, despondent when she realizes her that everything she's done to hang on to her husband Richard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (allowing his invalid brother to drown, deliberately causing herself to miscarry)</span>has instead driven him away (he's fallen in love with her sister Ruth), poisons herself and makes it appear as though Ruth (with or without Richard's encouragement) has killed her. It almost works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndOfDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndOfDays">End of Days</a></em>, one of the cops investigating a crime scene involving a man having been crucified to a ceiling after the Devil paid him a vist suggests with no trace of sarcasm in his voice that "maybe he did it to himself". Jericho, speaking for the audience, mocks him for it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The man is later revealed to be a Satanist.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fletch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fletch">Fletch</a></em>, Chevy Chase is hired by a wealthy man to break into his house and murder him. The wannabee-victim explains that he has bone cancer and will die horribly in a few weeks, but doesn't care to commit suicide as it would invalidate his life insurance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out it's a scam on the victim's part ... but that's only fair because Chevy's "junkie drifter" facade is also a pretense by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Intrepid Reporter</a> character.</span>
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em>, as part of the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>.
</li><li> A double twist variant serves as the bookends for the story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IRobot">I, Robot</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The robot <em>did</em> kill Dr. Lanning, but it was actually because Lanning told him too.</span>

</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Narc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Narc">Narc</a></em>, similar to the insurance examples below.
</li><li> Angier pulls this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrestige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrestige">The Prestige</a></em>, with the added twist of (sort of) not actually being dead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShadowOfTheThinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShadowOfTheThinMan">Shadow of the Thin Man</a> has two dead bodies show up in connection with a gambling racket; a jockey whose body was found in the shower, and a corrupt journalist on the take from the racketeers, both shot. Though the connection between them is tenuous at best, Nick bets Lt. Abrams that "there was only one murderer". He's right, but not in the obvious way; the jockey committed (accidental) suicide. He had thrown races on the orders of the racketeers, was afraid of being exposed, and planned to kill himself. He chickened out at the last minute, dropping the gun down the drain in the shower, but did so in such a way that the hammer hit a curve in the drainpipe and the gun went off. Nick figures this out and retrieves the gun, but conspires with Lt. Abrams to use it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">Framing the Guilty Party</a>; they will tell the press that the same person who killed the jockey killed the journalist, and the murderer will put forward a suspect to take the fall for both crimes.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnivesOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnivesOut">Knives Out</a></em>: Marta, Harlan Thrombey's nurse, accidentally injected him with an overdose of morphine, and when she realised it he set up a fake alibi for her and cut his own throat because he was very old and didn't want her to have her life ruined by one genuine mistake. However, it then turns out that the drug supply was deliberately sabotaged by a would-be murderer to ensure that Marta would make that mistake. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And twisted one last time when it is revealed that Marta didn't overdose Harlan after all, making the suicide pointless.</span>

</li><li> A variation in "The Norwood Builder" where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the victim only faked his death in order to avenge himself on the supposed murderer- or rather the supposed murderer's mother for having refused him in his youth. He also did it to swindle his creditors by sending his money to a bank account with a different name.</span> And it would have worked except for a fingerprint belonging to the murderer being found y the police. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Holmes knew the print wasn't there the previous day, which led him to realize the victim was still alive, and some quick calculations involving the size of the rooms and a straw fire led him to the truth.</span>

<ul><li> A variation in <em>Murder at the Mews</em>: The suicide had been without second intentions, but a friend of the deceased planted fake evidence to make it seem like it was a murder committed by the person who had driven her friend to suicide with his blackmailing.
</li><li> Agatha Christie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript">recycled</a> this from "The Market Basing Mystery", which has the same method of suicide, and the same method of disguising it as murder.
</li><li> This was attempted in <em>Wasps' Nest</em>. A dying man who has lost his fiancee to his best friend decided to kill himself using cyanide after convincing his love rival to purchase said poison for the purpose of getting rid of a wasp nest in his backyard. Thankfully, Poirot caught wind of his plot and switched out the poison with harmless soda.
</li><li> Agatha Christie changed the ending of her <em>Appointment with Death</em> novel in the play adaptation. There, the tyrannical Mrs Boynton cannot bear the thought that her family will be free from her psychological torturing of them when she dies, so she kills herself in a way that will make it look like one of them did it so she can still keep tormenting them in death. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>.

In the first case, the fact that the death appeared to be murder was due to chance, but the second case had the more usual situation of the suicidal person deliberately trying to frame an enemy for murder.

In the novel, a clumsy Serbian assassin (who's distantly related to him) tries preventing him from doing so, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeenThereShapedHistory">accidentally kills him</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">his extra index finger</a> hits the trigger.
</li><li> In <em>Fletch</em>, the book by Gregory McDonald, the protagonist is hired by a wealthy man to break into his house and murder him. The wannabee-victim explains that he has bone cancer and will die horribly in a few weeks, but doesn't care to commit suicide as it would invalidate his life insurance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out it's a scam on the victim's part he wants to murder Fletch... but that's only fair because the protagonist's "junkie drifter" facade is also a pretense by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Intrepid Reporter</a> character.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>
<ul><li> One episode had a woman who tried to frame a doctor for her murder by having an affair with him and committing suicide.
</li><li> A man who lost all his money in Blackjack (trying to use the double-every-bet tactic) wedging a knife between a door hinge and slamming himself into it making it appear he was stabbed to death, so his life insurance would cover for his brother.
</li><li> Another time involved a hunter making his suicide look like a hunting accident for very similar reasons - in this case to allow for a generous life insurance payout to his wife.
</li><li> An episode has Catherine, Langston <em>et. al.</em> dealing with a woman who sought to escape her financial woes and rocky marriage by framing her husband for her 'murder'. The 'murder weapon' was ingested poison - namely, two full tubes of <em>fluoridated toothpaste</em>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>.)
</li><li> A subversion occurs in the episode "Who Shot Sherlock?", where the victim is the Holmes of a Sherlock Holmes club. Greg finds the gun attached to an elastic cord, concealed in the fireplace. It looks like <em>The Problem of Thor Bridge</em>, but it turns out the victim was drugged with morphine instead of Holmes' habitual cocaine, and it's a murder disguised as a suicide disguised as a murder.
</li><li> Hodges' 'death' (actually a scenario for his board game) in "You Kill Me" turns out to be this.
</li><li> One of the New York episodes involved a man who shot himself outdoors with a gun attached to helium balloons. The gun floated away but did eventually come down to earth and was recovered.

<ul><li> The wife of a chronically ill man who killed himself concealed the suicide because he would have not been buried in the church if she hadn't, suicide being a sin and all. Interesting as there was no "murderer" set up.
</li><li> Another example: Jessica has to save an old Irish cop friend who is set up by a career criminal dying of brain cancer. He used a hollow wall and a stone to drag the gun out of view.
</li><li> Another episode had a dying Italian winery owner who invited his daughter's latest boyfriend, who he knew to be a Mob hitman, to the house in hopes the hitman would kill him and his death would make the family work together. Unfortunately, the plan went wrong and the vintner killed the assassin.

</li><li> In another episode, a young mother with severe, untreated postpartum depression blows up her car to kill herself and her children. She never specifically says she meant for it to look like murder, but it's mentioned that she rejected another method (carbon monoxide poisoning by intentionally breaking a space heater) because people would know what she had done, implying she wanted people to think someone besides her was responsible.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Used in several soap operas, particularly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em>. Devastated when husband Josh leaves her to reunite with ex Reva, Annie suffers a miscarriage. However, the baby remains in her womb. At a party, Annie lured Reva to the top of a steep staircase, provoked her into an argument, then made it appear as though Reva had shoved her down the stairs. Reva was charged with manslaughter for the death of the baby until it was proven that the baby had died long before Annie fell down the stairs.

</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> apparently drew this conclusion when he and Watson played the board game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue">Cluedo</a></em> in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS02E02TheHoundsOfBaskerville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS02E02TheHoundsOfBaskerville">The Hounds of Baskerville</a>" episode, thinking it's the "only possible solution".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a>:</em>
<ul><li> A woman faking her own murder got the plot rolling in the episode "On The Line", loosely based on the Conan Doyle Thor Bridge story. The audience saw her go through with it in the cold open, including a 911 call where she identifies an old enemy of hers as her "assailant". Sherlock figures it out pretty quickly but soon regrets exposing the plot, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man she framed was a sadistic serial killer</span>.
</li><li> Season one episode "You Do It To Yourself" featured a professor shot dead in front of witnesses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">in his eyes</a> — which looked like a vicious revenge killing. The truth is, he hired his own hitman after being diagnosed with an incurable and fatal illness, whose first symptom manifests in the eyes — and out of spite, he arranged things so that evidence would point to his Teacher's Assistant (and his wife's lover) hiring the hitman.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise">Death in Paradise</a></em>
<ul><li> An episode featured an elderly woman made a voodoo prediction about her own death at the hands of a "scarred man" and then died in suspicious circumstances the next day. As it turns out, she had long suspected this particular scarred man of her daughter's murder, and she faked her own murder at his hands in order to get the police to investigate him again.
</li><li> In another episode, it <em>looks</em> like this when it a while into the episode turns out to be suicide made to look like a robbery gone wrong so the insurance pays out. There's one more twist left to be played, however... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the victim had been manipulated into committing suicide by his doctor, who had gone so far as to lie the victim had a terminal illness.</span>
</li><li> In yet another episode, this becomes clear towards the end of the episode. <em>Unlike</em> the above examples, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the person committing suicide wasn't involved with making it appear as if he'd been murdered. It was the victim's <em>friends</em> that arranged that when they found the body, in a bid to frame a faux-friend who was lying to and blackmailing the victim.</span>

It later turns out that Spencer <em>had</em> committed suicide and Dr Rush planted the weapon in Young's room, not to frame him, but to throw enough doubt on him to get him replaced by someone would <em>would</em> permit Rush to conduct experiments on the Ancient Control Chair.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> had Dr. Beckett playing an attorney whose client was accused of murdering a neighbor. The neighbor's daughter had disappeared under mysterious circumstances when a little girl and the neighbor always believed that the client was responsible. Sam eventually discovers that the neighbor slit her own throat with one of the client's kitchen knives to invoke this trope.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> had a murder turn out to be suicide where the victim planted evidence to convict three girls who had bullied her. Somehow in the end, we're supposed to be sorry for the victim because she was bullied and not the three teenagers who could have gone to prison for life. Raises the question of would we still feel the same way if she had just shot the three girls?
</li><li> A variant happens in one episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElleryQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElleryQueen">Ellery Queen</a></em>.

In this case, the goal was to give them all a bad weekend of being accused. Scheduled service for the elevator would have revealed his suicide.

Unfortunately, an unanticipated delay between her overdose and her arrival at the painting caused her to fall down a flight of stairs and suffer severe injuries. Undeterred, she then crawled on the floor to get that one last look at her beloved's painting; this unfortunately created the impression that she had been beaten and that she desperately attempted to escape her attacker before she succumbed.

The problem is, Team Gibbs can't arrest either of them because no matter who they chose, there's enough ambiguity in the evidence to establish reasonable doubt that it could have been the other one, making it impossible for a jury to convict. It turns out the guy killed himself, and that the two women set up the ambiguous crime scene <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsuranceFraud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsuranceFraud">to collect and split the life insurance money as it wouldn't pay out on a suicide</a>.

The trial which eventually leads to Phoenix's disbarment is one in which Phoenix is defending Zak Gramarye (real name: Shadi Enigmar), who is suspected of murdering his mentor, Magnifi Gramarye. During the trial, it's shown that Zak was sent instructions to kill Magnifi by Magnifi himself (who was already dying of cancer); however, it's revealed that Valant, Magnifi's other apprentice, also got the instructions and that Magnifi was testing his apprentices to see who was worthy of his inheritance. Phoenix proves that Valant manipulated the time of death, leading one to the thought that Valant is the murderer. However, after investigating, Phoenix learns that both Zak and Valant could not have committed the crime, leaving no other possible suspects. It's not until seven years after the trial ends that Phoenix finds out Magnifi committed suicide, as he had always planned to.

He actually tricked one of the students into poisoning him, so that whether he died of the poison or by dropping the spear (as a result of being poisoned), said student would become the murderer.

<ul><li> "Justice Be Done" features Jack and Trixie going to the reading of the will for Mordecai Brasseau, an occasional but not particularly well-liked client. The will, actually a recording of Mordecai reading it, requests the detectives find out who murdered him. He was poisoned gradually over a long period, a period so long that none of the suspects, his last wife, his son, his daughter, and his lawyer, were ever around him long enough to pull it off alone and mostly hated one another too much to do it together. Because of this, Jack and Trixie realize that Mordecai's murderer was Mordecai himself, that his "murder" was an act geared towards getting his estranged family to realize how insensitively they had behaved towards him since all they had seemed to want was his wealth. To honor Mordecai's wishes, they decide to put on a big deductive show making it clear why each person is a suspect, revealing why they couldn't have done it, then revealing the truth. They aren't particularly proud of themselves over the act, regarding this as the worst of the multiple bad cases Mordecai had brought them.
</li><li> "A Simple Case of Black and White" features Jack and Trixie being hired by a pro bowler, Jim White, who wants to reunite with the woman and child he ran out on. However, when Jack and Trixie find the woman and her little boy, they return to their client to find him murdered, shot in the stomach by a gun registered to the woman's current husband, Donald Black. The gun was reported stolen a year ago and the detectives realize that White was in town for a tournament at that time. Their theory becomes that White was in town last year, found his ex with a new husband and son with a new father, and plotted revenge against the man he felt had taken what was his. To this end, they determine, the gutshot was deliberate, a slow and painful means of death in order to give himself time to get rid of the evidence of his suicide. The episode ends with police lieutenant Sabien telling everyone that confirmation of this theory was waiting on snaking the glove White had worn to keep powder burns off his hands from his toilet.

</li><li> A suicide staged to look like a murder was the official conclusion in the 1978 death of Leonard Fagot.
</li><li> Books on forensic medicine usually include case histories or crime-scene descriptions of real deaths that initially appeared to be suicide and were later ruled to be murders or vice versa.
<ul><li> A particular well-thought-out one was where the woman pointed the gun at herself from above and in front of her chest and shot herself through her clothes. A woman who commits suicide by gun <em>usually</em> does it from below and under her clothes. The forensic specialist had one of those indescribable hunches, and performed a test on the woman's hands for gunpowder residue; it came back positive. This, combined with the total <em>lack</em> of gunpowder on her ex-boyfriend's hands (and he'd been tested far too soon to wash or otherwise destroy the evidence) led to the verdict of suicide, not murder. (Yes, it was a revenge plot.)
</li></ul></li><li> Fox Lake, Illinois cop Charles Joseph "Joe" Gliniewicz committed suicide on September 1, 2015, and tried to make his death seemingly look like he was murdered with his own gun by unknown assailants.
