</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bartender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bartender">Bartender</a></em>: According to Hanegashima, every cocktail is a Tough Act to Follow. Either you underperform, and the customer will never return, or you do your best, and your customer will come back, and expect you to do even better.
</li><li> Following the cult success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodTheLastVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodTheLastVampire">Blood: The Last Vampire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a> was entrusted to work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ProductionIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ProductionIG">Production I.G</a> on their own version, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC">Blood-C</a></em>. However, the overall reception of the franchise was mixed, coupled with the low BD/DVD sales of the TV series and the movie bombing in the Japanese box office despite the latter being funded by the Japanese government. This also affected CLAMP's later works.
</li><li> Every series in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> franchise following the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> has been notably controversial for some reason or other, also making this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">First Installment Wins</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> has created quite a few short manga since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, but they've barely registered on most people's radars. It might be because they're almost all single-volume series, though. He's never even attempted a long series since <em>Dragon Ball</em> ended, partially for fear of this trope. He does avert this trope in the video game realm, where he remains quite popular as the head artist for the cult classic games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon">Blue Dragon</a></em>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> series. His earlier series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump">Dr. Slump</a></em>, was a huge success in its native Japan, and was considered the tough act there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite the success of <em>Fist of the North Star</em>, artist Tetsuo Hara never quite managed to match its level of success in his following works, with <em>Hana no Keiji</em> being his only other serialized manga at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Jump</a></em> to had lasted a standard three year run. He eventually left Shueisha to form his own production company Coamix with his former editor-in-chief Nobuhiko Horie in 2001, where he was given the creative freedom to work on the <em>Fist of the North Star</em> prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheBlueSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheBlueSky">Fist of the Blue Sky</a></em>, which enjoyed a full ten year run thanks to Hara himself being a co-founder of the publishing company, but it's overshadowed by its more successful predecessor.
</li><li> This also applies within <em>Fist of the North Star</em> itself, as everything after Raoh's death is generally seen as a downhill trend in quality. In fact, the final chapters after the Land of Shura arc (which is the last big conflict in the manga) were not adapted for the anime series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a> Last Order</em> is an example. The original <em>Gunnm</em> was a huge success; it was translated into English under the name <em>Battle Angel Alita</em> and became a must read manga classic for people getting into the genre. The sequel is no where near as successful and only survived mainly because of dedicated fans of the original giving it a cult following.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em> was a very popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsWithGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsWithGuns">Girls with Guns</a> manga and did good enough to get a well made 3 episode OVA that also became very popular. The follow up <em>Gunsmith Cats Crash</em>, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">rejected by most fans</a> for it being just silly action with no focus on plot and character development like the original.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Jewelpet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Jewelpet">Jewelpet</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetTwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetTwinkle">Jewelpet Twinkle</a></em> is the second season, and the one whose shadow looms over every sequel season. The reason for this is because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> and had lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, and then they decided to follow it up with three light-hearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LadyJewelpet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LadyJewelpet">Lady Jewelpet</a></em>, the sixth season, is considered an improvement (being similarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>), but has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> due to the drastically reduced screentime of the titular Jewelpets. And let's not get started on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">Franchise Killer</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetMagicalChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetMagicalChange">Jewelpet: Magical Change</a></em>, which even got cancelled before its time because of how badly it was received.
</li><li> For those who are fans of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetSunshine">Jewelpet Sunshine</a></em> (the third season) is the one the other gag series (and <em>Lady</em>) struggle to live up to.

The manga sequels and movies have suffered from this as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> had this problem with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">He became very bitter over this</a>, but has lightened up considerably since working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> tends to suffer from this as a whole, depending on how well or poorly received the previous series was.

Sometimes the creators deal with this by making their series <em>such</em> a departure that there's no way to compare it—such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> being followed by the unabashedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a> that is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em>.

</li><li> This is probably the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda">Eiichiro Oda</a> has said he won't do anything else after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is finished.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> fell victim to this.

</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan">Sazae-san</a></em> had become a huge success and the most viewed anime ever (a record which remains unbeaten to this day), Machiko Hasegawa created a new comic strip called <em>Granny Mischief</em> about an old woman who always spent her time creating trouble for her fellow man with all kinds of pranks. It's just as funny as <em>Sazae-san</em>, but never became quite as popular.
</li><li> Director Kazuki Akane started strong with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em>, which became wildly popular (even broadcast on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxKids">Fox Kids</a> in the United States), and remains to this day one of the most iconic anime from the 1990s. His next project was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Geneshaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Geneshaft">Geneshaft</a></em>, which was seen by few and hated by most who did. His next creation was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a></em>; most who know of it know only about how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a> paid for it (as much as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">FUNimation</a> paid for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>) and how poorly it sold. Next came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein">Noein</a></em>, which fared better in popularity and reception, but only modestly. His latest work was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a>: Decode</em>, which sold very poorly in Japan.

This created decently high hopes for its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em>; hopes that <em>Energon</em>, having a very rushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, could never meet. The final installment, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em>, ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyImprovedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyImprovedSequel">inverting this trend</a>; <em>Energon</em>'s disastrous launch left a <strong>very</strong> low bar that <em>Cybertron</em>, with its strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and plotting, was easily able to jump over.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">first season</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aikatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aikatsu">Aikatsu!</a></em> is widely regarded as the best season of the series (if not the entire franchise) in terms of writing, character development and world building in spite of the less-than-stellar animation. Some of the franchise's most iconic songs, namely "Diamond Happy!" and "Calendar Girl", also come from this season. The following three seasons and reboot series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AikatsuStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AikatsuStars">Aikatsu Stars!</a></em> are generally considered to be significantly weaker in the aforementioned categories despite the improved animation. <em>Stars!</em> got hit even harder with this as it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">completely tanked</a> to the point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamco">Bandai Namco</a> lost money on it and is running the risk of becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">Franchise Killer</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AikatsuFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AikatsuFriends">Aikatsu Friends!</a></em> is a second attempt at reviving the franchise, but its optics are not looking too good.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosHead">Chaos;Head</a></em> anime was the first to be adapted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ScienceAdventureSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ScienceAdventureSeries">Science Adventure Series</a> (to mixed reviews). After that, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> anime was released, to mass critical acclaim and being listed as one of the top anime of all time on various anime database sites. None of the adaptations after <em>Steins;Gate</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/RoboticsNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/RoboticsNotes">Robotics;Notes</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OcculticNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OcculticNine">Occultic;Nine</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosChild">Chaos;Child</a></em>) have managed to capture the same level of success.
</li><li> Irodori's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends">Kemono Friends</a></em>. After gaining <em>massive</em> popularity with its grounded approach to the plot and gateway status to the rest of the franchise, no other media associated with it before or after could match that level of acclaim. Tomason was a definite victim of this, especially since they picked up the reigns for Season 2 after Tatsuki's firing and ran against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kemurikusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kemurikusa">Irodori's immediate next work</a>. To say it had a lot to live up to was barely scratching it.
</li><li> Many people were surprised to hear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiromuArakawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiromuArakawa">the author</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, one of the most high-rating manga and anime of all time and a very dark adventure story, would be making a slice-of-life dramedy about a boy going to an agricultural university, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilverSpoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilverSpoon">Silver Spoon</a></em>, and it clearly had its previous work's shadow looming over it. Many were pleasantly surprised that <em>Silver Spoon</em> turned out to be just as high-quality as its predecessor in its comedy and character-driven drama and exploration.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> was very well regarded (save for the ending) during its run, and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em> has had nowhere near the same amount of popularity or success. Fans have speculated that certain plot points and characters from <em>Negima</em> were added to bring back fans of the previous series, as it wasn't nearly as related to the previous series in its earliest chapters.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BoogiepopSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BoogiepopSeries">Boogiepop Series</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> of the light novel medium, and because of its huge impact Kouhei Kadono never really managed to create another series that was as successful.

Chuck Austen followed Johns' run, and was widely considered to be one of the worst writers in the franchise's history.

<ul><li> <em>Green Lantern</em> also has Geoff Johns, who brought back Hal Jordan (without displacing any other human Lantern) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCop">Space Cop</a> stuff, while also expanding the mythos to include multiple Lantern Corps, and turning the franchise into a gigantic space opera that became central to the DCU. The stuff that followed by Robert Venditti is <em>not</em> looked highly upon, nor are any of the <em>Green Lantern</em> series that take the space opera approach. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLanterns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLanterns">Green Lanterns</a></em> gets a pass for having the characters focus on Earth and being more about everyday superheroics, but that's about it.

He was followed by Reginald Hudlin, whose work was immediately hit by the this trope in full force. His run initially outsold Priest's by quite a bit, but as time went on, sales fell sharply. A relaunch stunt involving T'Challa's sister Shuri taking over as the lead didn't do much better, and the title was eventually cancelled under new writer Jonathan Maberry.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some feel that every era lives uncomfortably under the shadow of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a> era, who redefined Daredevil into the gritty noir character known today and established much of his expanded mythos and acclaimed stories, such as the Hand, Elektra, "Exposé" and "Born Again".
</li><li> Any <em>Daredevil</em> run following the <strong>hugely</strong> successful Bendis and Brubaker eras. Both were massively successful mega hits and award winners, and the follow-up, Andy Diggle's run, is as a result not looked highly upon. Waid's run gets a pass for being very tonally different than the Bendis and Brubaker runs, but the Soule run that followed got this treatment for not living up to <em>all three</em> runs, <em>as well</em> as the hit Netflix series.
</li><li> Despite following those two, Mark Waid's <em>Daredevil</em> run is now <em>also</em> this. Noted for its more lighthearted and optimistic tone, while still maintaining a darkness and drama to itself, the run is noted for being a much more different take on the character that didn't eschew the darkness, but addressed it directly. It's also liked for the focus on supporting characters like Foggy Nelson and Maggie Murdock. Following this run, the idea of a darker <em>Daredevil</em> run was not only negatively compared to the Bendis and Brubaker eras but also the more optimistic Waid era.
</li></ul></li><li> Anything <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a></em> related following Rick Remender's <em>Uncanny X-Force</em>. While the previous run had its fans, it has a very big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> for being almost a parody of what X-Force is (mutants who kill to protect other mutants). Remender portrayed this and didnt glorify it, and in fact deconstructed the entire idea of a mutant kill squad, while still allowing for character development. He also masterfully implemented X-Men history into his run. The runs that followed... well, theyre more traditional X-Force runs (meaning style over substance and grimdark galore), and just arent considered as good. To put it lightly: <em>Uncanny X-Force</em> is considered not only the best X-Force run, but also one of the best X-Men comics of all time, while every <em>X-Force</em> run that followed is barely remembered.
</li><li> Ed Brubaker's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em> was lauded as a great reinvention of the character and his mythos, combining political commentary with a sleek spy-fi angle while having lots of twists and turns. It's also noticeable for having Bucky Barnes not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a> in retconning him into a much darker character, but turning him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> by making him the new Captain America. The series was an audience and critical darling and brought the character into a new century. Every run that's followed has been negatively compared to it. Rick Remender's run was considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a> pulp sci-fi when it wasn't loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> and Nick Spencer's run became controversial for the sheer <em>volume</em> and unsubtlety of its political commentary <em>before</em> it pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a> to turn the titular character into a nazi (and made an event out of it).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grayson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grayson">Grayson</a></em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/BetterThanItSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/BetterThanItSounds">Better Than It Sounds</a> spy series about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> operating within an organisation determined to find out the secrets of superheroes. While originally loathed for not having Dick as a superhero, a cover depicting him holding a gun and cancelling the then-ongoing <em>Nightwing</em> series, come release, it gained popularity <em>very</em> quickly, and helped launch the career of Tom King and provide some mainstream work for Tim Seeley. The series was liked for its fundamental understanding of the character despite its strange situations, playful yet very strong dialogue, as well as actually doing something new and refreshing with a Batman character. The series ended and was followed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NightwingRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NightwingRebirth">Nightwing (Rebirth)</a></em>, written solely by Seeley. While not considered <em>bad</em>, it's considered a fairly standard Bat-family superhero comic, and the absence of King is very noticeable, as Seeley had Dick narrate every issue. To say <em>Grayson</em> fans aren't wow'd is putting it lightly.
</li><li> Similarly, Tom King faced this. Not only did he have to follow-up the beloved <em>Grayson</em>, but he <em>also</em> had to follow-up the Hugo-nominated, Harvey and Eisner Award-winning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision2015">The Vision (2015)</a></em>, his acclaimed reinvention of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmegaMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmegaMen">Omega Men</a></em> and sleeper hit <em>Sheriff of Babylon</em>. These were <em>all</em> comics that were hits in a single year. Eventually, his sole project would be as the main writer for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanRebirth">Batman (Rebirth)</a></em> ongoing. The series is known for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>, and a lot of it is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> from readers who had heard about King but hadn't read him. The dialogue is considered not as skillful as in <em>Grayson</em>, <em>Omega Men</em> or <em>Sheriff</em>, it's not considered as original as <em>any</em> of the mentioned works and hardly does anything <em>revolutionary</em> with the character, which kind of became King's whole thing thanks to all his popular superhero works doing those things. King himself jokingly acknowledged the possibility of this trope taking effect.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tom King</strong>: Realize I'll never be on this many year list things again. You're only the new guy with new ideas once. Grateful to be on this ride now.

<ul><li> Mark Waid's run developed Wally so that he became more than just Barry Allen's successor as the Flash, having him grow and mature across the entire run. It also featured what is considered one of the most realistic relationships in superhero comics in Wally's relationship with Linda Park. Not only that, but it introduced the concepts of the Flash Family, unifying DC's speedsters into one family dynamic, while also introducing beloved speedster Bart Allen (Impulse). Waid introduced the concept of the Speed Force, which has become central to the <em>Flash</em> mythos and gave the franchise a more mythical element. Waid's run told larger than life stories that could span across time and space, or just focus on one city, but all were steeped in strong character work. His run is considered the <em>definitive</em> run on the franchise, and nothing that follows is looked as highly upon, including Waid's own returns to the book.
</li><li> Geoff Johns' run is considered this too, though is also considered not as good as Waid's. Johns brought in a smaller scope, focusing on world-building with Keystone City and Central City. Johns' run is also known for its strong villains, bringing back the Rogues, setting up some new characters, and bringing in fan-favourite villain Hunter Zolomon, a character that is considered incredibly sympathetic yet monstrous, and incredibly powerful without being overpowered, along with having an interesting motivation and personal relationship with Wally, to the point that every evil Speedster has been negatively compared to him. Johns' run is also known for how it gradually built up over time, with almost every arc leading to an epic conclusion. Like Waid, subsequent <em>Flash</em> works are often negatively compared to Johns' run, including Johns' own subsequent <em>Flash</em> work with Barry Allen (Wally's predecessor as the Flash).

It reintroduced Wonder Woman's post-Crisis origin while updating it to incorporate the Cheetah and was very well-liked for being sentimental and heartfelt while never being boring, and interesting inclusion of the Greek Gods that incorporated more recent and nuanced interpretations of them. The following runs are disliked for either being boring, bringing back Wonder Woman's disliked New 52 origin or disliked interpretations of the Greek Gods.

When it was released in spring 1996 after some two years of writing and several months of proofreading and editing, the Rangerphiles believed that all <em>CDRR</em> fics to come had to live up to these high standards. As they felt they couldn't write anything even close to it, they decided not to write anything at all. <br/>It wasn't until 1997 that another <em>CDRR</em> fic was published.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PixarRegulars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PixarRegulars">Lee Unkrich</a> admitted to waking up physically ill from worry while directing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3">Toy Story 3</a></em>, afraid he would screw up the series. He turned out to be wrong, as the third film was able to get extremely positive reviews by the fans and critics alike. Unfortunately, that warm response has made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3">Toy Story 3</a></em> this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a>; their next film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars2">Cars 2</a></em>, was the company's first outright failure with critics, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave">Brave</a></em> didn't exactly help matters (in spite of it still garnering positive reviews and winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar for 2012, it was a surprise win over Disney's better-received <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em>), with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity">Monsters University</a></em> being the studio's lone standout of the period (the critically better-received of the trio).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGoodDinosaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGoodDinosaur">The Good Dinosaur</a></em> fell into this rut.

As a result, the movie was generally well-received, more so than Pixar's <em>Cars 2</em> beforehand, but not nearly as much as its predecessor and only around the same lines as <em>Brave</em> and <em>Monsters University</em>. More concerning, it's also the first Pixar film to actually be a domestic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a> after 20 years of the studio's filmography (Pixar's rivals at Disney Animation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation">DreamWorks Animation</a> had bombs handed to them rather early in their existence, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SinbadLegendOfTheSevenSeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SinbadLegendOfTheSevenSeas">Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas</a></em>, respectively.)

Consensus-wise, <em>Finding Dory</em> isn't seen as epic-scale as the hype led expectations for it to be, but is still regarded by many to be a worthy follow-up to <em>Finding Nemo</em> nonetheless (especially with its record-breaking box-office results, such as the highest-grossing animated film in North America since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek2">Shrek 2</a></em>).
</li><li> The announcement that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4">Toy Story 4</a></em> was in production was met with an extremely polarizing reaction within mere minutes, especially from those who thought that the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3">Toy Story 3</a></em> was the perfect ending for the franchise and that any further movies would be stomping all over said ending (or, at the very least, were skeptical that <em>4</em> would garner as enjoyable or emotional of an experience as <em>3</em> did). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail">In spite of this</a>, upon release, the movie was ultimately a success with critics and fans and regarded to be just as good as the first three movies (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">though some still swear up and down and all-around that the third movie should have been the end of the franchise</a>).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SharkTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SharkTale">Shark Tale</a></em> came out just after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek2">Shrek 2</a></em> became a smash. The film's attempt to be a more mature story (with the death of an instrumental character) didn't tune in with either audiences nor critics, and was received much less favorably. This film also followed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo">Finding Nemo</a></em>, and got two negative labels: being called a mess all of the negative cliches DWA has been derided for, and having the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score out of all of their movies. It didn't help that the studio's following film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madagascar">Madagascar</a></em> would become wildly popular.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersVsAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersVsAliens">Monsters vs. Aliens</a></em> was a milder version, as it was sandwiched between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon">How to Train Your Dragon</a></em>, with both becoming notable for marking Dreamworks' turn into more story-based films.
</li><li> The studio entered a devastating rout after <em>Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted</em>: A few films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCroods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCroods">The Croods</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrPeabodyAndSherman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrPeabodyAndSherman">Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman</a></em> and <em>How To Train Your Dragon 2</em> became modest successes although neither got much notice. On the other side, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheGuardians">Rise of the Guardians</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Turbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Turbo">Turbo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PenguinsOfMadagascar">Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> became notorious bombs that almost bankrupted the studio. After <em>Penguins</em> was released, DreamWorks's PDI branch was closed while COO Mark Zoradi (a 30-year Disney vet who had only joined the studio months earlier), and CCO Bill Damaschke were fired. By 2015 however, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Home" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Home">Home</a></em> gave studio a badly-needed boost and <em>Kung Fu Panda 3</em> became as successful as the series' previous entries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShrekTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShrekTheThird">Shrek the Third</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShrekForeverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShrekForeverAfter">Shrek Forever After</a></em> also struggled to live up to the well received first two movies in the series.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoBatmanMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoBatmanMovie">The LEGO Batman Movie</a></em> had the bad luck to follow the critically acclaimed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie">The LEGO Movie</a></em>. While <em>Batman</em> is seen as a good movie, which turned a profit at the box office, it's generally considered somewhat of a step down, with much lower tallies than <em>TLM</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Storks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Storks">Storks</a></em> was an even bigger example, being Warner Animation Group's second movie, and its first entirely original property. This movie had a different crew behind it, and was met with far less praise from critics, as well as having to contend with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagnificentSeven2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagnificentSeven2016">The Magnificent Seven</a></em> on opening weekend. While it was ultimately the more profitable film thanks to a lower budget and far better overseas numbers ($109.7 million compared to <em>The Magnificent Seven's</em> $68.9), it was still considered a disappointment by Warner Bros.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGONinjagoMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGONinjagoMovie">The LEGO Ninjago Movie</a></em> failed to win over critics who enjoyed both of the two previous theatrical Lego movies, with reviews calling it too generic, with less effort to appeal to older audience members. These turned it into WAGs first movie with a Rotten RT score, as well as its first box-office bomb.

<ul><li> The Boeing 747, upon its first flight, was the world's largest passenger aircraft. Known as the Queen of the Skies, it has changed aviation forever and it's still going strong for more than 50 years. By the time Airbus unveiled the A380 however, times have changed. Although it is bigger than the 747, it couldn't keep up with the demands such as fuel efficiency and passenger load. Also, there are fewer A380 orders compared to the 747 and its family. Even worse, there are some airports capable of handling a 747, but not an A380! After more than a decade since its launch, Airbus has decided to halt its production and some airlines started to retire the A380 and focus on smaller planes which are more fuel efficient and feasible than the A380. This shows that future jumbo passenger aircraft couldn't match the impact and success of the Queen.
<ul><li> The 747-400 variant is this for the 747 family. Since its launch in the late 80s, it has become the most successful 747 variant, outlasting its predecessors. Although more airlines are retiring that variant, including Delta and United, the 747-400 is still around, with British Airways being the largest operator. When the new 747-8 is launched, in spite of the success of its cargo variant, its passenger variant isn't as big of a hit as that of the 747-400.

He is known to have appeared on the same bill with them only once, during an engagement at Keith's Orpheum Theatre in Columbus, Ohio, in January 1915. At the time, the Marx Brothers were touring "Home Again", and it didn't take Fields long to realize how his quiet comedy juggling act was faring against the anarchy of the Marxes. Fields later wrote of the engagement (and the Marxes):
<div class="indent">They sang, danced, played harp and kidded in zany style. Never saw so much nepotism or such hilarious laughter in one act in my life. The only act I could never follow...I told the manager I broke my wrist and quit".

Though far from the best game ever made, it was critically ravaged like it was the worst. This affected the manufacturer quite heavily, as this string of successes prompted arcade operators to pre-order pinball machines in large quantities sight unseen, confident that whatever was released next would be just as good. However, the weak early response to <em>Popeye Saves the Earth</em> by players terrified these operators, knowing they had paid a lot of money for <em>Popeye Saves the Earth</em> without the ability to return them. Some arcade game historians say that <em>Popeye Saves the Earth</em> falling below expectations scared enough operators from buying pinball that it was a direct cause of the industry's near total collapse a few years later.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> 2011</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>. This match got a five-star rating from <em>Dave Meltzer</em> — the last time the WWE managed that was the first Hell in a Cell match between HBK and the Undertaker (which was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a>'s debut). While every match Punk and Cena had together afterwards easily clocked at four stars and above, it's kinda hard to match this one for a variety of reasons, mainly being the atmosphere just isn't as charged as it was in Chicago (CM's hometown, by the way), and the stakes just weren't as high, lowering the drama factor. It's not helped that this is considered to be one of the best matches WWE has put on in <em>years</em> (with some even going on to say that it's the best match in WWE history).
</li><li> <em>WrestleMania XXVIII</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> vs The Undertaker in Hell in a Cell with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. In a 'Mania headlined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>, this is the match that everyone thinks about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a> TakeOver: Brooklyn</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a>. The fact that it was a Divas match of all things made it more surprising, but afterwards many consider it to be the greatest women's match in WWE history (despite the fact that it was on a <em>developmental</em> brand), and one of the matches of the year. In fact, the biggest, glaring flaw that everyone saw in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor">Finn Bálor</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Owens</a> ladder match, a sure show stealer on any other card, was the fact that it had to follow this one, and that match was relegated to a footnote. It was so good that their rematch got to headline the next special, making history in the process. Like with Taker/HBK, while the sequel was also considered amazing, most people still prefer the first.
</li><li> <em>WrestleMania 29</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>. Granted, this one is debatable seeing as not only was it the best match, many believe it was the only good match on the card (besides the always decent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a> match).
</li><li> <em>WWE NXT TakeOver: Dallas</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn">Sami Zayn</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a>. Expectations were already high enough considering the resumes both had, and this was Nakamura's debut match and Zayn's last NXT match, but then both men proceeded to blow those expectations out of the water. An instant classic, this match is nigh-universally considered the best match in all of 2016's <em>WrestleMania</em> weekend and one of the forerunners for match of the year. Even the highly anticipated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai">Asuka</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> match for the NXT Women's Championship wasn't able to live up to it, nor was the rematch for the NXT Championship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor">Finn Bálor</a>, and both, under normal circumstances, would've been sure fire contenders for match of the night.
</li><li> <em>Battleground 2016</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn">Sami Zayn</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Owens</a>. Great spots, perfect storytelling, and an emotional ending, it was the perfect match to cap off their rivalry (for now). What makes this even better is that this show had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> Triple Threat for the WWE Championship on it, and that was an amazing match as well. The fact that Zayn and KO managed to steal the show from one of the most anticipated matches in WWE history is nothing short of astounding.
</li><li> <em>WWE Roadblock</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>. Though it was mainly this in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> at <em>WrestleMania 32</em>. It was absolutely no secret that most fans wanted Ambrose in the main event that year. While the company wasn't willing to relent on Reigns, they gave a title match to Ambrose at a WWE Network special as compensation, while Reigns was out for his deviated septum. The match Ambrose had with Hunter ended up being the main forerunner for Match of the Year until Nakamura/Zayn happened at <em>Dallas</em>. Ultimately, the match Reigns and Hunter had wasn't able to live up to it.
</li><li> <em>WWE NXT TakeOver: New Orleans</em>: <strong>The entire event</strong> was this for the then-upcoming <em>WrestleMania 34</em>, and arguably for every <em>NXT TakeOver</em> special from here on out. Already having its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">Tough Act to Follow</a> in <em>NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia</em>, which ended in a five-star classic between then-NXT Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndradeCienAlmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndradeCienAlmas">Andrade "Cien" Almas</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnnyGargano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnnyGargano">Johnny Gargano</a> (the first WWE match to get this rating since the above-mentioned Cena/Punk match seven years ago), <em>New Orleans</em> completely outdid <em>Philadelphia</em>, with only one match clocking below four stars, and being bookended by <em>two</em> five-star matches; the opening match, which was an epic six man-ladder match to crown the first ever North American Champion, and the main event, which was the long-anticipated unsanctioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">grudge</a> match between former tag team partners turned bitter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemies</a> Johnny Gargano and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TommasoCiampa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TommasoCiampa">Tommaso Ciampa</a>.
</li><li> <em>WrestleMania 34</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>. Yes, really. Blowing even the best expectations out of the water, this match completely undid the entire crowd, and Ronda went from being derided by the IWC to their newest darling almost as soon as the match was over. It was so good that even <em>Dave Meltzer</em> felt that <em>WrestleMania</em> should've been over after that. Not even the highly-anticipated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> match (which had the added handicaps of a dead crowd and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>) could live up to it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>. TNA was originally created to fill the void that WCW left — the problem was that the times had changed and a lot of the stuff that made WCW so big were either regarded as passé or had their flaws magnified by TNA's attempts to rehash it. Then they started emulating the stuff that <em>killed</em> WCW during its disastrous final years (not-so-coincidentally, this was when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a> returned to the booking team), and somehow made WCW look <em>better</em> in comparison.
</li><li> The NXT women's division as a whole pulled this on the main roster women from the 2014-2015 period. NXT started giving the women time to wrestle, feuds that had meaning, fans were into them and the matches were usually hits. The match that really put NXT's women on the map - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte</a> vs Natalya at <em>Takeover</em> - was followed by a series of lackluster matches in the feud between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee">AJ Lee</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a>. General consensus was that the main roster women's matches were okay, but had no chance of overshadowing NXT. The 2014 <em>TLC</em> PPV was the worst offender, taking place only five days after an NXT special.
</li><li> The annual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a></em> PPV always has the titular match as the main event. By nature of the match's design, the Royal Rumble keeps the crowd constantly active, wearing them out by the end when they finally reach the winner. As a result, the rare occurrence where the match <em>isn't</em> in the main event has the following matches having to endure dead crowds. This problem only got worse during the 2018 <em>Royal Rumble</em> PPV, where there were <em>two</em> Rumble matches thanks to the historic, first ever <em>women's</em> Royal Rumble. Because of the novelty of the match, the women's match was the main event that year and the men's match was placed in the middle of the show, exhausting the Philadelphia crowd for the following two matches. The women's match managed to wake them up, but needed the aid of a proportionally larger amount of nostalgia/surprise entrants than the usual Rumble match (going by the formula of the men's match) to do so.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Microsoft Windows</a>:
<ul><li> Throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEighties">The '80s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, Windows slowly but steadily matured, staring out as a shaky graphical environment for DOS computers and growing into a more capable, fully-fledged operating system. Windows XP, released in 2001, represented the culmination of this maturity; it completely ditched any sort of dependency on DOS and was based on the previously business-oriented Windows NT codebase. Since NT was built from the ground up to be a multitasking OS with protected memory and improved dependency management, it had greatly improved stability compared to prior releases of Windows. In spite of some notable remaining flaws (especially when it came to security), many users thought it was "good enough", especially after many of these issues were ironed out by service packs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hepo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hepo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hepo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As proof of this, Microsoft continued supporting XP until <em>2014</em>, 13 years after it released, and even then released some critical security patches after that, due to the huge numbers of people and organizations that stuck with XP regardless.</span>. Microsoft seems to have thought this too, and thus sought to make XP's successor, Windows Vista, into a revolutionary product packed with cutting edge must-have features that would entice people to upgrade. Unfortunately, this made Vista into an overly ambitious project that ended up releasing in an unfinished state despite its protracted development time, and both users and hardware manufacturers refused to adopt it due to its high hardware requirements, instability and incompatibility with existing hardware and software.
</li><li> Microsoft followed up Vista with Windows 7, which many described as "What Vista should have been," or "Vista with the kinks worked out." It had all of Vista's improvements to security and graphics, but with the stability and compatibility of XP<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wz1w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2wz1w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wz1w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Partly due to genuine improvements in the OS, and partly because hardware and software had had the time to update their products</span>, leading it to become Microsoft's new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">Tough Act to Follow</a>. Indeed, they struggled to follow up 7 much in the same way they struggled to follow up XP, with Windows 8 being widely criticized for pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">We're Still Relevant, Dammit!</a> by shoehorning an interface designed for phones and tablets into an OS primarily used on desktops and laptops. While Windows 10 managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">Win Back the Crowd</a> to a significant degree, many Windows users still long for the golden days of 7 due to Windows 10 having some controversial elements such as forced updates<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3261x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3261x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3261x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which often interrupt your use of the computer to deliver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a> software without giving you any choice in the matter</span>, and a shift towards a "software as a service" model that pushes things like advertisements in the OS and brings privacy issues through increased data collection.

<ul><li> Any team that was led to success by a standout athlete has trouble after he goes away - best example being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan">Michael Jordan</a>-less Chicago Bulls.
<ul><li> Or the Denver Broncos without John Elway. It's actually eerie how similar those two turned out: Jordan was universally regarded as basketball's greatest player, while Elway was a top class quarterback. Both retired in 1999 after winning championships, and neither team has truly recovered. (Of course, Jordan came back with another team, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">we prefer to not think about that</a>)
</li><li> Another would be the 49ers without Jerry Rice or Joe Montana, as well as the Dolphins without Dan Marino, and the Bills without Jim Kelly.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a>, Ferrari after Michael Schumacher. Or any other team.
<ul><li> Schumacher's career after he returned to the sport after retirement. The most race wins in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> history, most driver championships and all around legendary. Naturally it would be impossible for him to live up to his own record since he hadn't raced in F1 for a number of years and he wasn't in a team as good as Ferrari. Initially he got some flak (which everybody noted for being unreasonable) for not being his "old self" but his post-retirement career has been respectable. Fortunately, this made Kimi Raikkonen's return to the sport easier as people accepted that they couldn't expect too much - his post-retirement career has been equally respectable.
</li><li> In Brazil, anyone after Senna - Rubens Barrichello in particular got some flak from being the new Brazilian driver but unlike Senna not having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">his prowess, powerful car or luck,</a> <strong>until</strong>, that is, he pulled the proverbial rabbit out of his hat by beating The Stig.
</li><li> In the UK this has an odd occurrence, having produced so many successful drivers means that not one of them is overwhelmingly considered to be the greatest (Moss, Clark, Stewart, Hill, Mansell and Hamilton all being equally well regarded for example) but the commentary partnership of Murray Walker and James Hunt (or Martin Brundle) and the BBC's use of "The Chain" as the theme song for the coverage are so etched into the public mind that any other suggestions will always be compared to that.
</li></ul></li><li> Every Brazilian National <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Football (Soccer)</a> Team after the Pelé-led team of Mexico 1970. The winning teams of 1994 and 2002 have come close, but since Korea-Japan the team has been increasingly beaten in any World Cup they are in, leading to the "Verde-amarela"'s infamous 7x1 loss against Germany in the 2014 World Cup.
</li><li> Argentina and the "Maradona Curse": Diego Maradona's infamous doping-related retirement in the 1994 World Cup led to the downfall of the same team which had won two World Cups in 1978 and 1986, and the last two (South) America Cups, their 1993 championship being the most recent trophy for the "Albiceleste". And while they got the upper hand in Brazil '14, they were crushed by Germany in the finals, while beaten one year later by Chile in the 2015 Copa América (and one year later as well in the "Centennial Cup"). This has gotten to the point Messi has been mocked for his subpar performance for his national team while being Barcelona's superstar.
</li><li> Also in soccer: For a long time, the USA women's national team was this after the groundbreaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a> champions of 1999. Despite four Olympic golds since then, it took 20 years for the team to <em>completely</em> exit the shadow of the 1999 team. The 2011 World Cup team came close, but lost to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Japan</a> in the final. The shadow finally lifted in 2015, when the USWNT dispatched longtime nemesis Germany in the semifinals and got revenge against Japan in the final. It went away decisively in 2019, when they dominated what by all accounts was the strongest women's field ever assembled to repeat as champions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4j242');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4j242" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4j242');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">How dominant? They never trailed once in the tournament, outscored their opponents 263, and led for more than 70% of the total time they played. And the only times they were seriously pressed in the tournament, they were only in danger of an equalizer. Not to mention that they took down four top-10 teams in the process (of course, they entered the tournament at #1). One player went so far as to say before the tournament that she felt the US had the two best teamstheir starters and their bench.</span>
</li><li> English examples. England's 1966 World Cup winning squad (The Brit team of later years has been more notorious for its failures). Liverpool in the 1980's (they have not won a league title since 1990!), Manchester United's 1999 Treble winning side, Arsenal's Invincibles from 2004.
</li><li> The New York Yankees will never be as loved as when they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth">Babe Ruth</a>. They probably will never even be as loved as when they had Mickey Mantle. Respected, maybe. <em>Feared</em>, yes...
</li><li> Bill Mazeroski, the Hall of Fame second baseman for the Pittsburgh Pirates, called his walk-off home run to win the 1960 World Series to complete an upset of the Yankees "a curse in disguise." He was never a prolific hitter, and outside of Pirates fans, people saw only that home run, not realizing he is the best defensive second baseman to have ever played the game.
</li><li> Roger Maris, after breaking Babe Ruth's single season record for home runs claimed the rest of his career would have been "a helluva lot more fun" had he never done that.
</li><li> Any league with a salary cap essentially forces this as any team with a surprisingly good year is forced to get rid of half their players since they're now demanding pay raises, especially if they win the championship. Aversions happen in teams that are centered around a few key players or have excellent general managers.
</li><li> When legendary goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel left Manchester United in 2000, the Red Devils had a tough time finding a 'keeper good enough to replace him; Mark Bosnich and Massimo Taibi were busts, Fabien Barthez was good but inconsistent, Roy Carroll wasn't good enough, and Tim Howard only became a star after he was transferred to Everton. In 2006, United finally got a star GK in Edwin van der Sar; some even consider him better than Schmeichel left. This was averted when van der Sar retired in 2011; while replacement goalkeeper David De Gea initially had some struggles, he eventually adapted to the Premier League and became one of the best, if not THE best, 'keepers in the world (while becoming Spain's own replacement for Iker Casillas).
</li></ul></li><li> Manchester United manager cases:
<ul><li> No manager has yet been successful at replacing Sir Alex Ferguson. Fergie's replacement David Moyes was an abject failure, turning a title-winner into a mid-table side, while Moyes's own successor Louis van Gaal was widely derided for boring tactics, underachievement versus smaller teams, and a host of disappointing signings.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note516dq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note516dq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note516dq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He did, however, bring in such hidden gems like Ander Herrera, Daley Blind, and Anthony Martial; it was also under his watch that homegrown phenomena Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford became first-team regulars and former reserve Chris Smalling became a regular starter at CB. </span> Next came José Mourinho, who basically destroyed his reputation with even more underachievement, plus conflicts with players <em>and</em> management, that saw him sacked after a poor start to the 201819 season. The ship was righted to a certain extent when former United star Ole Gunnar Solskjær was hired as caretaker manager, improving things to the point that the "caretaker" label was removed near the end of the season, and after a shaky start to 201920 leading a youthful side to a third-place finish and Champions League football for 202021, but the jury is definitely still out on that.
</li><li> The managers who came after Matt Busby's retirement in 1969 suffered from this: Wilf McGuinness was out of his depth, Frank O'Farrell didn't get along with the players and made some terrible signings, Tommy Docherty relegated the Red Devils (he did bring then back to the top flight, though, made a couple of title challenges and won the FA Cup) Dave Sexton's style of play was sleep-inducing, and Ron Atkinson, despite never finishing lower than fourth and winning two FA Cups couldn't knock Liverpool off their 80's dominance. Ferguson himself was close to being another failed successor to Busby, but an FA Cup win in 1990, followed by great signings (Peter Schmeichel, Andrei Kanchelskis, Denis Irwin, and Eric Cantona) and a legendary batch of Academy graduates, ensured that he would successfully live up to Busby's legacy and outshine Busby himself.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is partly the reason why Oakland A's fans hate current owner Lew Wolff. The A's former owners Charlie Finley and Walt Haas were nothing short of legendary; Finley was an eccentric yet successful owner who headed the small-market A's during their early 70's "Swinging A's" dominance (thanks in no small part to guys like Catfish Hunter and Reggie Jackson), while Haas became well loved due to his excellence as an owner (the late 80's-early 90's A's successes were under his ownership) and his constant presence in the East Bay community. Wolff, on the other hand, is a cheapskate who doesn't really care about the A's; his refusal to spend money was what caused the A's to constantly lose stars like Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, Barry Zito, Yoenis Céspedes, and Josh Donaldson. If it weren't for Billy Beane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moneyball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moneyball">Moneyball-based</a> genius, the A's in the 2000s would've become a bigger joke than their equally unsuccessful Oakland neighbors (the pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry">Curry</a> Warriors and the post-Gruden Raiders).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> are prone to this. Heaven forbid any athlete returning for their second, third, etc Games doesn't match or improve on their previous performance—1992 Albertville gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi saw this coming a mile away and decided not to return for the 1994 Lillehammer Games.
<ul><li> Any sensational record in any sport. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Bob Beamon set a world record for the long jump with a jump of 8.90 m. Prior to this, the world record had been broken thirteen times since 1901, with an average increase of 6 cm; Beamon's jump bettered the existing record by 55 cm. The defending Olympic champion Lynn Davies told Beamon, "You have destroyed this event." The record stood until 1991. Beamon himself never won another Olympic medal.
</li><li> The absolutely daunting task that any future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> swimmer will have to face if they try to defeat Michael Phelps' record in Beijing 2008 of winning 8 gold medals in a single Olympics. As of Rio 2016, with 28 medals (23 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze) to his name, Phelps is the most decorated Olympian <strong>EVER</strong> in any event. And to top it off, by surpassing the 12 individual titles won by Leonidas of Rhodes in 152 BC, he also broke a 2168-year-old record set during the Ancient Olympic Games themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jamaica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jamaica">Jamaica</a> has been desperately searching for its next Usain Bolt since <em>before</em> the Rio Games, with him making it clear that they would be his last and not wanting to lose their well-established sprint dominance. Even so, regardless of nationality, it's unlikely his legendary record of three-peat victories in the 100m, 200m, and 4*100m will ever be matched or broken.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61lxc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note61lxc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61lxc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though Bolt would later lose one of the relay golds when one of his teammates tested positive for PEDs.</span>
</li><li> The 2000 US women's gymnastics team faced this going into the Sydney Games, knowing that they would be unlikely to measure up to the Magnificent Seven of 1996. Indeed, the team failed to medal—the bronze medal that they were eventually awarded was given ten years later and by default. While the 2016 team averted this, winning gold just like its predecessor (and performing even <em>better</em>), it's safe to say the 2020 team might suffer from this too.
</li></ul></li><li> As for personal tough acts to follow, quintuple Olympic ski jumping champion <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matti_Nyk%C3%A4nen">Matti Nykänen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a particularly sad case — not only did his sports career plummet with his failure in adopting the modern V style, so did his life. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>: <em>since the 1990s, his status as a celebrity was mainly fuelled (...) by his personal relationships, his "career" as a "singer", and various incidents related to heavy use of alcohol and violent behaviour</em>. He ultimately died in 2019 at all of 55, less than three months after having been diagnosed with diabetes. Again, according to The Other Wiki: <em>He reportedly did not adhere to a diet recommended to diabetics and continued to drink alcohol.</em>
</li><li> Brett Favre, after signing with the Minnesota Vikings, had the best season of his career, almost taking the team to the Super Bowl. The second season with them... well...
</li><li> When Andy Roddick won his first Grand Slam and became the World No. 1 in 2003, he was expected to continue the dominant American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a> tradition on the heels of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer">Roger Federer</a> shot to the top of the tennis world soon after and Roddick would never again win a Slam or hold the No. 1 position, but it's a sure bet that even if Federer hadn't been around to beat Roddick in four Slam finals, he would still have been doomed to fall short of Sampras's 14 Slams and Agassi's 8 in spite of being good enough to be included in the Tennis Channel's list of top 100 players.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer">Roger Federer</a> was so good at making dominating the rest of the men's tennis tour look like a walk in the park for him for four years, winning 11 out of 16 Grand Slams in 2004-07 and being ranked No. 1 for a record-breaking 237 consecutive weeks, that him starting to lose more than once in a blue moon after 2007 was viewed by some fans and pundits as him "being in decline" even though he was still easily one of the top 2-3 tennis players in the world year after year. Federer himself said that he had created a "monster of expectations" after his loss to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> in the 2008 Australian Open semifinals was perceived as a disappointment because he had made the finals of the last 10 Slams.
</li><li> In 2012, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> won one Grand Slam, the year-end championships, a total of six titles, and finished the year as No. 1, which would qualify as an incredible season by any reasonable standard — but since this came right after his otherworldly 2011 season in which he won three Grand Slams and went undefeated for over 40 matches, the general consensus of his 2012 season was that it was "good, but not as good as his 2011 season."
</li><li> The 70s dynasty of the "Steel Curtain" Pittsburgh Steelers is not only hard to follow for the franchise itself, but also for most teams in the NFL, even the ones that succeeded in creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> winning dynasties themselves. In the case of the Super Bowl, it's called the "Super Bowl Hangover"; the New England Patriots were the last back-to-back Super Bowl Champions, and, until the 2014 season, were the last team to win a playoff game after winning the Super Bowl the previous season. The latter part was broken by the 2014 Seahawks, who made Super Bowl XLIX, but lost to the Patriots.
</li><li> It's common in season previews to treat the last champion that retained its core players with "anything less than a repeat will be a disappointment for fans".

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> Jacques Villeneuve is a curious example. He won the World Championship, and more races than his father Gilles, plus the Indianapolis 500 and the IndyCar championship. Yet, he still lives somewhat in the shadow of his father even though Gilles never won championships. Mostly this is because Villeneuve Sr. was a very spectacular and charismatic competitor tragically killed in his prime, driving for Ferrari. Also, Jacques' winning career in F1 lasted all of two seasons before he then spent the next decade in the midfield. Of the two, Gilles actually had a longer winning career.

</li></ul></li><li> With the conclusion of Rugby World Cup 2015, with the New Zealand team - the All Blacks - standing victorious once again, the retirement of rugby legends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">Richie McCaw</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">Keven Mealamu</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Dan Carter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Conrad Smith, Ma'a Nonu</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Tony Woodcock</a> has rugby fans feeling this trope deeply.
</li><li> The Edmonton Oilers have had an extremely tough time following the sudden departure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WayneGretzky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WayneGretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> in 1988. Everyone swore he couldn't be traded, but indeed he was, and the Oilers were left struggling to find their identity without him. Decades came and went with the Oilers struggling to even maintain a decent seasonal record, let alone find their next Gretzky (though they did win one Cup without him), before they finally seem to have struck gold with Connor McDavid, who to boot wears 97 on his jersey - just two away from the league-forbidden 99 (though the Oilers retired it on their own before the NHL at large did). Gretzky's 99 banner might not be all that big, but it certainly casts a huge shadow for McDavid and his teammates to skate under. He seems largely up for the task, though, guiding the Oilers farther than they had been in years in just his second season of playing for them in 2017. That's not to say there's no pressure on him to turn things around for this franchise, though...
</li><li> The FIFA World Cup has had several instances of defending champions that were knocked out in the first round of the competition<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8e4ce');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8e4ce" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8e4ce');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(not counting Uruguay in the 1934 World Cup, when they refused to join; that being said, Argentina, second-placed in the previous World Cup, was knocked out in the first round)</span>
<ul><li> The first defending champion to be knocked out in the first round of a World Cup was Italy in 1950. A combination of external circumstances, such as not having any of the World Cup double-winning players (thanks to the Second World War), the 1949 Superga air disaster killing many of Italy's best players, and poor planning (travelling by boat instead of a plane due to the aforementioned event) led Italy to be defeated by Sweden (who would advance to the finals) and defeating Paraguay, which was not enough to go to the next round.
</li><li> The second example happened in England 1966. Defending champions Brazil were pitted against Bulgaria, Hungary and Portugal, and ended up knocked out in third place after defeating Bulgaria and being defeated by both Hungary (who were knocked out in the quarter finals against the USSR) and Portugal (revelation of the tournament, defeating the USSR in the third-place match).
</li><li> The first and most noticeable example comes in 2002. After winning the 1998 World Cup at home turf as well as the 2000 Euro Cup <em>and</em> the 2001 Confederations Cup, France makes an embarrassing display not only by being knocked out in a group containing Uruguay, Denmark and first-timers Senegal, but also <em>by failing to score a single goal</em> (a draw against Uruguay and defeats to Denmark and Senegal). It was such a shocker that FIFA assumed France's terrible performance was due to defending champions not needing to play qualifiers, ending up unprepared. Ever since, the defending champion needs to play in the qualifiers to earn their place in the next World Cup. It seemed to go fairly well at first, as Brazil reached quarter-finals in the 2006 World Cup...
</li><li> ... but then, it backfired <em>spectacularly</em>. In the 2010 World Cup, defending champions Italy were handed a very easy group, against first-timers Slovakia and second-timers New Zealand, as well as Paraguay... but ended up in the <em>last</em> place by drawing against Paraguay and New Zealand and losing to Slovakia. The other finalist of the 2006 World Cup, France, also failed to get past the group stage (in a group with eventual fourth-placed Uruguay, Mexico and hosts South Africa) after drawing against Uruguay in the first game, and a scandal popping up as they lost against Mexico and South Africa.
</li><li> The 2014 World Cup pitted the two 2010 World Cup finalists, Spain and the Netherlands, together alongside Chile and Australia. One of the toughest groups in the competition indeed, but Spain being knocked out with one game remaining, after being demolished 5-1 by the Netherlands (who finished third) and being defeated by Chile, was unexpected. They did win their third game against the also-eliminated Australia, however.
</li><li> Germany has one of the most powerful national football teams, only being knocked out in a first round once (in 1938), and they had won the 2017 Confederations Cup without their best players. A mixture of the 2014 World Cup-winning team with the 2017 Confederations Cup-winning team ends up with Germany being knocked out in the 2018 World Cup group stage against Mexico (whom they lost 1-0 in the first game), Sweden (who they defeated 2-1 in the last play, after a comeback) and South Korea (whom they <em>lost</em> 2-0 during the final minutes of the game). This makes <strong>three</strong> defending champions being knocked out in a row in the group stages.
</li><li> On a similar vein, the winner of the Confederations Cup has never won the following World Cup. Brazil in 1998 (winners of the 1997 Confederations Cup) and France in 2006 (winners of the 2003 Confederations Cup) have got the closest to breaking this trend, but both lost in the final match.

</li><li> Lionel Bart stuck it big with Theatre/Oliver, but his 5 others musicals didn't make such a impression.

Complainers tend to overlook the fact that even so, HF's story is still a tad more complex than that of an average, non-licensed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> line, and its characters are among the most developed of any original-LEGO characters (if still far from <em>Bionicle</em>'s). LEGO themselves consider HF a wholly separate entity — a line that occupies the same niche as <em>Bionicle</em>, but it's not a follow-up. Further, they deliberately set out to <em>avoid</em> creating another complicated universe such as that of <em>Bionicle</em>, partly because of this trope, but mostly because a simpler story is easier to promote to younger kids, which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> has a hard time realizing.

But the old fans felt the story was watered down and too kiddie, unlike the original which had actual planning put into it. The line was cancelled even before LEGO's three year house minimum due to historically poor sales.

Magic Box has produced several other, similar collectible toys throughout the years (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FlickToStickBungees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FlickToStickBungees">Flick-to-Stick Bungees</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/StarMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/StarMonsters">Star Monsters</a></em>), but none of them have ever met the same level of success as <em>Gogo's Crazy Bones</em>, usually only producing two series/sets of characters at the most (if even that), in stark contrast to <em>Gogo's</em> having <em>way</em> more sets than that.

This divide ended up cutting into the show's profits and resulted in the return of the Critic, much to the dismay of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker">Doug Walker</a> himself, who loved <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel">Demo Reel</a></em>, and wanted to focus on that project of his dreams; instead having to torch the thing and bring back the character everybody else wanted.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> had such a devoted and passionate fanbase that when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> premiered, it was held to an impressively high standard and unfortunately, in the eyes of many fans, did not meet expectations. And since then, <em>Beast Wars</em> has become almost like a measuring stick for newer Transformers shows to be compared to.
<ul><li> The Transformers franchise suffers from this as a whole. Despite numerous reboots the 1984 series is considered the definitive version. Any new version is compared to it and rarely passes. Even <em>Beast Wars</em>, the most successful reboot had hatedom for a while (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">"Trukk not munky"</a>, <em>et al</em>).
</li><li> One of the reasons why this situation results in numerous arguments among fans is because the <em>Generation 1</em> show and <em>Beast Wars</em> are seen as "the standard" for different reasons by different people. G1 for many fans <em>is</em> the definition of Transformers — its concepts, the characters, the designs, the overall "feeling" of the show is what hard-core fans want to re-experience in every new cartoon. <em>Beast Wars</em>, on the other hand (and nowadays <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> as well), is used as a comparison point because it is a generally good, solid, quality production. In short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">part of the fandom</a> strives for the preservation of details between the different TF iterations, while the other isn't so concerned about these, just want a show that's <em>good</em> in its own right.
</li><li> Another <em>Transformers</em> show that gets this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRobotsInDisguise">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em>, which directly follows the generally well-regarded <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>. The general consensus is that trying to be a sequel to <em>Prime</em> is <em>RiD's</em> entire problem; if taken as its own story that just happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">set in the same continuity</a>, it's pretty enjoyable and fun. However if taken as an epic continuation of <em>Prime</em>, as the creators described it, than it stumbles badly, as <em>RiD</em> largely leaves <em>Prime</em> alone, merely using that show as a source of backstory.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>, being the first successful animated sitcom on TV proved particularly difficult to top, even for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> themselves. They tried with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a></em>, but it never caught on quite the same way. Many Hanna-Barbera animated TV series after that failed to duplicate the enormous success <em>The Flintstones</em> had. Eventually the first animated TV sitcom hit to surpass the success of <em>The Flintstones</em> with children and adults would be from a completely different studio: a little show called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>.
</li><li> Many of the revivals of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> have suffered from trying to live up to the quality of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation">Golden Age</a> theatrical cartoons. That said, quite a few productions tried to avert this by intentionally going in a different direction from the original shorts, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> going for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom">sitcom</a> approach.

It does help that <em>Superman: TAS</em> is more grounded (by Superman standards) than most adaptations while still managing to be lighthearted, entertaining, idealistic, adventurous, relatable, and extremely faithful to the source material and mythology of the original Superman comics with only some minor deviations (some of them have made it into the comics no less), which is one of the many things that the live action adaptations have failed to accomplish (as they tend to be either too campy, dramatic, or, as of recently, depressingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangsty</a> and too different from the source material).

The high level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gags</a> in <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em>, especially in its early seasons, can make it unbearable to sit through for viewers wanting more drama and/or characterization.
</li><li> The first animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicstrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicstrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> special, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></em>, attracted half of the nation's TV viewers of its time, won a Pulitzer Prize, and continued to air every winter for over 50 years. The second, <em>Charlie Brown's All-Stars</em>, didn't win any awards, and only aired sporadically afterwards. The fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsTheGreatPumpkinCharlieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsTheGreatPumpkinCharlieBrown">Charlie Brown's second most popular TV special</a> came a few months afterward probably pushed it even deeper into obscurity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em> has the misfortune of following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> among cartoons based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>. After the series' announcement, fans <em>already</em> felt like cursing Marvel Animation for not going beyond 52 episodes of <em>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em>, despite the fact the announcement said nothing more than, "A new <em>Avengers</em> cartoon will come next year."
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> premiered in 1997 as one of the premiere shows of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning">One Saturday Morning</a>, it attracted a huge fanbase (most being a part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>) and critical acclaim, as well as being nominated for many awards (and winning one), getting a very successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RecessSchoolsOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RecessSchoolsOut">movie</a> (and two direct-to-video films), and gaining various types of merchandise, while the rest of the shows on the block eventually faded into obscurity. In 2001, the creators made another show for the block, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LloydInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LloydInSpace">Lloyd in Space</a></em>, which despite getting very good ratings and reception, it never matched the popularity <em>Recess</em> had (and eventually got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>). The later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoundPuppies2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoundPuppies2010">Pound Puppies</a></em> series from the same creators is also not looked on upon as fondly as <em>Recess</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> hit the proverbial jackpot with the amazing success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy">Ren &amp; Stimpy</a></em> in the 1990s. Most, if not all, of his subsequent cartoons have been widely panned, or at best receive a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a> response.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> While the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> series is widely beloved, the various comic book continuations (especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheSearch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheSearch">The Search</a></em>) have gone on to receive mixed reception. Meanwhile, sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> (and its own comic book continuations) have also received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">wide variety of responses</a>, with general consensus averaging out to the show being good, but nowhere near the level of its predecessor.
</li><li> On the subject of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, while Book 4 is generally considered to have concluded the series in a very satisfying way, Book 3 is generally considered by <em>Avatar</em> fans to be the one book/season of <em>Korra</em> that was around the same quality level as the best of <em>Airbender</em>, a height that Book 4 wasn't quite able to reach for many.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> have built a reputation as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Sacred Cow</a>, with a rabid fanbase hailing them as dripping with perfection. Both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> miniseries' and <em>especially</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> seasons have been doomed to the highest levels of scrutiny in comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many fans feel that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TUFFPuppy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TUFFPuppy">T.U.F.F. Puppy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BunsenIsABeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BunsenIsABeast">Bunsen Is a Beast</a></em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post Script Seasons</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FairlyOddParents">Fairly OddParents</a></em> do not measure up to this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ButchHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ButchHartman">Butch Hartman</a> series, feeling that he set the bar so high with it.
</li><li> For the series itself, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheUltimateEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheUltimateEnemy">The Ultimate Enemy</a></em> special is the most loved episode of the series for its dark tone and memorable villain. As such, later episodes and the show's divisive third season failed to be as well-liked.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> had this problem with its villains. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the first season had Malware, a terrifying and intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Knight of Cerebus</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">beloved by fans</a> and had the unique gimmick of being an evil mechamorph trying to make his own Omnitrix. After him, none of the other villains were able to capture the same level of interest; the Incurseans, Albedo, the Rooters, Maltruant, and even classic baddies like Vilgax and Zs'Skayr just couldn't compare to him. His departure from the series is cited as one big reason the show went through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a>.
</li><li> For a while many felt that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>'s last great show and that Disney TV Animation had fallen into a rut since, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> being the only good show coming out of the studio. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> would eventually come out, however, and is seen as the beginning of a renaissance that includes other shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The season finales following the Season Four finale "Twilight's Kingdom" are this, with the two-parter being seen as having the best combination of action pieces, big character moments, adventure elements, stakes, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">shake-ups to the show's dynamic</a> than any season finale before or since. Season 5's "The Cutie Re-Mark" is viewed as much more subdued and anti-climactic in comparison, with any shared elements being done to lesser effect, the Mane Five and other major characters being demoted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">background characters</a> being something of a disappointment, and Starlight Glimmer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">the resolution</a> which results) being viewed unfavorably. Season 6's "To Where and Back Again" is even more underwhelming, having even less action and cinematic feel, a lack of the main characters in favor of Starlight leading some of the supporting characters in saving the day, and said group having no means of fighting back against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> until the very end, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">Only the Author Can Save Them Now</a>. Season 7 and Season 8's finales only got <em>more</em> divisive.
</li><li> Season 5 in general is seen as a tough act to follow to Season 4, which was seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">a return to form</a> for the show. From the aforementioned characters, Starlight Glimmer, and the Season finale, Season 5 is a hot point of contention because of the lack of any of the interesting arcs and stories Season 4 had<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9lx7c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9lx7c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9lx7c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Season 4 had the Rainbow Chest/Rainbow Power overarching plot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAl">Weird Al</a> guest starring in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode">Musical Episode</a>, the Power Ponies, the Equestria Games, the Breezies, weird bat transformations, the continuation of the Discord arc, etc.</span> The mid-season hiatus didn't help matters either.
</li><li> Season 6 got hit with this even worse. While still considered a decent season by the fandom, it was criticized for the overarching plot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Starlight Glimmer's</a> redemption, not having enough standout episodes and a lot of the episodes suffering from poor comedy (including an over-reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance">cartoonish</a> faces as the crux of jokes, sometimes multiple times within a single episode, to the extent where even scenes intended to play out seriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">accidentally devolve into dumb jokes</a>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCopiedItSoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCopiedItSoItSucks">They Copied It, So It Sucks!</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: Most people agree that the newer episodes have greatly suffered in comparison to the gold standard set by the first three seasons before the first movie and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Cancellation</a>. The second movie was a return to form, but nevertheless isn't quite as beloved as the show itself. Second-half episodes that had to follow a beloved classic, such as "Home Sweet Pineapple" or "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V", are also seen as this to some people (with first-half episodes like "The Secret Box" and "Krabby Land" seen as the inverse of this).
</li><li> Every DC cartoon has had to deal with this since the end of the beloved and influential <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a></em>, which was critically acclaimed for its faithful and mature treatment of the source material.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> had a small problem after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncancelled">Uncancelled</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mako">Mako</a>, the voice for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy">deliciously evil Aku</a>, had died in the eleven years between the show's fourth and fifth season. He was replaced by Greg Baldwin, who had done the same for General Iroh in the last season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> following Mako's death, with generous consensus being that while Baldwin did a good job, he wasn't as good as Mako's Aku.
</li><li> Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> received acclaim from both critics and the fans, being considered one of the best seasons of television that year. Season 4, although still considered a good season, received criticism for less interesting, creative plots, and humour that didn't land quite as often.
</li><li> After the first season villain Nox who was both terrifying and very sympathetic, the second season villains of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>, Rushu and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quilby</span> felt rather lackluster, though the latter character has his defenders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">Noddy's Toyland Adventures</a></em>, despite making some changes from the original books, was one of the most popular and faithful adaptations of the original <em>Noddy</em> books, and none of the revivals have been able to match its success in the UK.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> also went through a number of TV series adaptations. The first <em>Welcome to Pooh Corner</em> is a live action variety show that has become largely obscure, though the second show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em> was not only an animated series incredibly loyal to the style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em>, but ran on a good animation budget, had creative and sometimes emotionally powerful story lines, a valid number of the original voice actors, and a catchy theme song, averting Disney's usual run with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries">Recycled: The Series</a> by being considered a terrific companion piece to its respective film. While later shows, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBookOfPooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBookOfPooh">The Book of Pooh</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyFriendsTiggerAndPooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyFriendsTiggerAndPooh">My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh</a></em> garnered a fan base, they were considered a significant step down from <em>New Adventures</em>. Some even go far as to say the later feature length instalments pale compared to <em>New Adventures</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment">Disenchantment</a></em> is a fairly solid show on its own merits, but it has to live up to the fame of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a>'s previous titles; the previously mentioned pop culture symbol that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, as well the minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Sacred Cow</a> and adored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>. Both have huge fandoms and widespread recognition between both public and critics, so it's no wonder why some people felt underwhelmed by the new show.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw">Milo Murphy's Law</a></em> is well received, its not seen as being on-par with the creators' previous show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>. It doesn't help that the show's second season began with a crossover between the two series, followed by some characters becoming heavily integrated into the series. This led to a common complaint that MML, regardless of any writing improvements, is being overshadowed by its predecessor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>: The critical and commercial success this show received resulted in Western animation fans holding it up not only as the bar for its successor series on Disney's networks to meet, but Western children's animation as a whole. Fans would spend the next several years comparing any show with an overarching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> or any hints of mystery to <em>Gravity Falls</em>, with Disney themselves trying to recapture the formula with shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Amphibia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Amphibia">Amphibia</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse">The Owl House</a></em> (the latter two being headed by GF alumini).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OverTheGardenWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OverTheGardenWall">Over the Garden Wall</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s first original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries">Mini Series</a>, and saw immediate critical and audience acclaim that cast a large shadow over all future miniseries that the network would produce such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LongLiveTheRoyals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LongLiveTheRoyals">Long Live the Royals</a></em>, as well as shows that had their first seasons branded as such, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AppleAndOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AppleAndOnion">Apple &amp; Onion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a></em>. Even if the general consensus is highly positive (like with <em>Infinity Train</em>), the question of "But is it as good as <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>" will inevitably pop up.
