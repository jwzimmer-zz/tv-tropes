<ul><li> In a Vonage VOIP commercial, a couple with a new child walk into the room where the father refers to their daughter as "their new bundle of joy". Hearing the word "Bundle" the wife remembers something and explicitly states that they are losing a lot of money to his current phone bundle and they should drop it. The husband, seemingly unable to hear the word "Phone" in her sentence, thinks she is talking about their child. So when she states they should get rid of the bundle as it will just get harder to do the longer they don't, the husband has a look of utter horror on his face.
</li><li> Some of the Bresnan Communications commercials involve a married couple talking about 2 different things
</li><li> A commercial features a husband and wife talking about how they've "been waiting so long" and hoping something has "turned blue" and how excited they both are. <em>She's</em> talking about a pregnancy test. <em>He's</em> talking about the new cans that change color when the beer inside is at the ideal temperature. When they realize this, she runs away crying, and his attempt to apologize... falls flat. "It's blue like your eyes!"

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Gohan gets blackmailed by a girl to go out with her (not Videl), since she knows "his secret." No, it isn't that he's the Great Saiyaman; it's that he wears teddy bear underwear.
</li><li> In episode 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BokuWaTomodachiGaSukunai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BokuWaTomodachiGaSukunai">Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai</a></em>, when playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a> game, Kodaka tells Sena and Yozora that since its a co-op game, they should try playing more cooperatively. Both girls immediately "agree" they should "play more cooperatively" from that point on, and in the next scene they're just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">fighting each other</a> more than the monsters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Ed and Al begin talking to Maria Ross when she mentions <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hughes</span>'s death. However, due to Mustang telling them that he retired to the countryside, they think Ross is talking about his <em>retirement</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's then subverted when she mentions that he received a double promotion. When the Elrics question the flawed logic of somebody retiring and receiving a Double Promotion, both parties realize what happened.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao">Demon King Daimao</a></em>, when Akuto goes to visit Junko's father, he doesn't realize that the reason for the visit is a marriage interview, rather than just a typical meet and greet. Junko however, thought he knew, and their conversation is pretty ambiguous until she secretly meets with him in his room at night.
</li><li> Expertly done in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>, where the main character has a running conversation with himself which has little do with what several characters who come in one at a time have to say to him... but somehow manages to sound okay to them.
</li><li> The last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KyouNoGoNoNi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KyouNoGoNoNi"> Kyou no Go no Ni</a></em> ends with two of the characters talking about a childhood promise they made. The boy is talking about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise">Childhood Marriage Promise</a></span>, and the girl is talking about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her (broken) promise not to tell about the time the boy wet his bed</span>.
</li><li> Happened at least twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>, at least in the OVA, with a newly-arrived girl claiming to be 'the promised girl', but actually talking about an entirely different (but nonetheless important) promise than the one that's been a central theme for the entire series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, Negi asks Asuna to accompany him on a trip to search for traces of his father, as his magic partner. Asuna misinterprets it as a love confession, as do Yue and Nodoka, who overhear it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Haruna doesn't</a>, but she does enjoy the ensuing hilarity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki">Mayo Chiki!</a></em>, Jiro receives his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss">First Kiss</a>" from Subaru as CPR; later, Kanade kisses him as well, and he believes this to be his first. Subaru notices that he seems troubled and offers to help as a friend, but freaks out when he starts talking about his first kiss. She thinks he found out and doesn't know about the kiss he had with Kanade, while he has no idea about Subaru's kiss and thinks Kanade told her about her own. The discussion becomes quite heated, and neither realizes what the other's talking about until much later.
</li><li> A staple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mitsudomoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mitsudomoe">Mitsudomoe</a></em>. Such as Shinya's fangirls mistaking a younger photo of the triplets' dad for their crush. Futaba being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">Daddy's Girl</a> leads to some awkward tension between them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>. In episode 27, Nanami thinks she has laid an egg. The rest of the episode is full of this trope whenever she tries to talk to someone about it.
</li><li> Episode 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> opens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">Itokishi</a> talking to his student <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Harumi Fujiyoshi</a> about producing "fan-made publications". He's talking about self-published poetry; she's talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">erotic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">doujinshi</a>.
</li><li> Several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em>. A notable one is when Eri idly asks Tenma if she's seen a male body before. Tenma says yes, referring to a wrestling match she had recently gone to with Karasuma. The resulting conversation has Eri thinking Tenma is talking about sex while Tenma describes the various moves she saw at the match.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>: Touma confronts his dad about getting involved with magic and casting the appearance-swapping Angel Fall spell... and his dad thinks he's just talking about collecting occult souvenirs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi">Kimi no Iru Machi</a></em> could be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeries">The Series</a> of this trope. Seriously one cannot go three chapters without the story of the week situation around a character thinking of one thing and everyone else thinking of something entirely different. Though it doesn't help that the characters have a habit of using vague comments. Some Key Examples being:
<ul><li> Eba being told that Erectile Disfunction could lead to failed relationships. Believing the it is some kind of Gum Disease she goes around casually asking all of her friends about Haruto might having this.
</li><li> Eba's friend asks if she and Haruto would like to try this sometime to which she holds up a magazine with an article about a vacation. Eba sees another article about sexual exploration and thinks she wants to have a threesome, and is later shocked that Haruto is so casual about accepting.
</li><li> Haruto is on a trip with an old female friend to which he causally mentions that he met up with someone he hasn't seen in awhile and is happy to be with her. While he was talking about his girlfriend Eba, she believed he was confessing his feelings to her.
</li><li> Then there is the situation where Haruto's female neighbor asked if there was anything she could do to help him after he helped her earlier. He comments that she could help help him with a load he needs to get out. While he is talking about his dirty laundry, she assumed he wanted to have sex with her.
</li></ul></li><li> Mashiro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou">The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant">Idiot Savant</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>, so she causes quite a few of such moments.
<ul><li> In episode 2 , Nanami walks to school with Sorata and Mashiro. She asks them what their relationship is, and the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant">Idiot Savant</a> Mashiro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">innocently</a> answers that he's her "first boy". She then makes it sound like they're lovers, causing Nanami to run off, and she finally clarifies he's the first boy she's befriended, which irritates him due to her out of context dialogue just moments earlier.
</li><li> Another hilarious incident occurs in episode 7, when Mashiro enters the bathroom after Sorata is done cleaning it up. His sister Yuko wonders what he's been doing at the apartment, when she shows up, and pats her belly and says its ready. His sister immediately assumes they were sleeping together and passes out. Then Mashiro mentions that dinner's ready.
</li><li> One that Mashiro was not to blame: In episode 11, Sorata overhears Rita on the phone talking to Mashiro's father. She says that Mashiro will be returning to where she belongs, and he immediately assumes she would be heading back to England. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Episode 12 reveals that said place was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyHousehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyHousehold">Sakura Hall</a>, and Mashiro was at the airport with Rita merely to send her off, something she had planned to get Sorta to tell Mashiro what she means to him.</span>

Guido goes to great lengths to prevent his son from developing trauma from this by preventing him from finding out that they're there to work to death, instead making him believe these jobs are all part of a game, and the prize for winning is a tank. At the end of the film, the Nazis have fled the camp after killing anyone they can find, and the Jews all leave, until only Giosuè remains, his father convincing him to hide. Just as Giosuè leaves his hiding space, an American tank rolls in to camp, and the drivers take him with them until they find his mother. Giosuè still believes what his father told him, and believes that the tank was theirs, so as he is reunited with his mother, he happily cries out that they won, while his mother says the same thing, only she is referring to the fact that they survived.

</div></li><li> Dear God, <em>all the time</em> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em>. The show frequently structured entire episodes around such miscommunications, often showing the same conversation two or three times over from different perspectives.
<ul><li> Notable examples include: Sally thinking Patrick's girlfriend is stepping out on him with Jeff, while Patrick's girlfriend (who's bisexual and in favor of an open relationship) thinks Sally is hitting on her; Patrick flirting with Jane's therapist, with each one believing the other is gay; and the telephone mess involving a phony bar full of Australians and "Giselle, the French bitch" that leads to Susan and Steve's break-up.
</li><li> One favorite is when the guys are having a conversation with Sally's date. He's a butcher, but Sally told everyone he's a surgeon, so they are all shocked when he explains that she's one of his regulars and even more shocked when he states, "Well, you know how it goes. Just a few good cuts and you have the woman of your dreams."
</li><li> The episode <em>The Girl with Two Breasts</em> showed Jeff's attempt to flirt with a beautiful Israeli woman. Despite the language barrier (Jeff only speaking English, her only Hebrew) it appears to go well. The story then rewinds to show it from the woman's perspective (her speaking fluent English, him a gibberish faux language). The word he assumed to be her name is revealed to be Hebrew for "breasts". It only goes downhill from there.
</li><li> <em>9 1/2 Minutes</em> shows the same short period of time from three different perspectives, with almost every conversation in the episode falling under this trope. The new character of Oliver runs a comic shop. Other characters mistakenly believe him to be a gynaecologist, which makes many of his statements (the shop name "Hellmouth"; John Hurt's chest-bursting scene in <em>Alien</em> being "the reason I got into this business") inadvertently horrifying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>: In an early episode of season 1, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWeaponmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWeaponmaster">Matt</a> shows up to the office sporting a nasty bruise over his right eye from a fight with the Russians. Foggy and Karen ask him what happened and Matt shrugs, saying, "Yeah, yeah, I wasn't paying attention last night. It was my fault." Matt is talking about how the Russians had lured him into a trap that he narrowly got out of alive, while Foggy and Karen are led to assume that he accidentally tripped or walked into a door, and Foggy suggests he get a seeing eye dog.

The only one there is J.P., who thinks Patrice is Dwayne's replacement. He asks Patrice if he is the "new guy", and Patrice replies "I suppose him". J.P. then goes to say that he hads big shoes to fill, how much Florence misses the last guy, and how he needs to "keep things warm" till Dwayne gets back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em> near the start of season 6, Carlos and Lynette have a conversation where Carlos is talking about Lynette having breast implants while Lynette thinks he is talking about her pregnancy that she is trying to keep a secret from him, no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenConfession">Mistaken Confession</a> resulted though.
<ul><li> An earlier example (Season 5): Lynette thinks that Tom is using the warehouse where his group rehearse to have sex with another woman. It actually happens that one of his sons is using said warehouse for that. When Lynette confronts Tom, Tom thinks that he's speaking about their son, but after Tom tells her about it, Lynette realizes in horror that his son is having sex with an older woman(much to Tom's shock, as well).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>: At one point, Dexter is presented with some of his blood slides.

Laura talks to Sally, who reveals that her beau's a mortician, and she's reluctant to tell her friends because she's worried they'll make fun of her. At the same time, Rob and Buddy discover the guy is married, leading to an amusing conversation between Rob and Laura:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rob:</strong> Wait'll I tell you what I found out! <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> I found out, too. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> You did? How? <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Sally told me. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> Sally told ya?! <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Well, of course, Darling, don't you remember? That was the point of the whole luncheon. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> You mean Sally knows? <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Well, naturally. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> Well, she doesn't care? <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Oh, not too much. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> Well, I can't' believe that! <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Well, see, what's she really afraid of is that people will kid her about it and make jokes. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> Jokes?! Honey, I don't see that that's anything to joke about! <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Gee Rob, you must be one of her square friends. <br/><strong>Rob:</strong> Square?! Is that what you call it?

I talked it over with Laura, and she agrees! <br/><strong>Carl:</strong> You talked it over with Laura?! <br/><strong>Harriette:</strong> Sure, she's part of the family! Carl, it's just that you do the same thing over and over, all summer long, every single Saturday. <br/><strong>Carl:</strong> Well, excuse me, but I think once a week is pretty darn good considering my back problem! And besides, you can help, you know. <br/><strong>Harriette:</strong> Well, I would, but you always want to be in control! I thought if you got your act together, we could invite the neighbors over! <br/><strong>Carl:</strong> <em>Invite the neighbors over?!</em> <br/><strong>Harriette:</strong> Well, why not? It's not like it's a big secret! They know what we're doing! They're doing the same thing, only better! <br/><strong>Carl:</strong> Just <em>how</em> do you know that? <br/><strong>Harriette:</strong> Because Marge gave Ted the article and he's cooking up a storm. You should taste his burgers! <br/><strong>Carl:</strong> What's that supposed to mean? <br/><strong>Harriette:</strong> What I said.

Whenever he is asked who he is, Savitar responds with "I am the future, Flash." Although Barry takes this as a boast from Savitar about how powerful and influential he is in the future, he eventually realizes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the actual quote is "I am the Future Flash."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> does the equivalent of moving from Newtonian Physics to Quantum Mechanics to this trope. About a third of the episodes from later seasons are built on this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, Chandler ends up thinking that Monica intends to get breast enlargement surgery, while Monica thinks Chandler is freaking out about her becoming pregnant. As a result, Chandler barges in and asks that Monica not change at all - she responds that not only her breasts will swell (as a result of pregnancy) but also her hands and feet as well. They talk for a bit, getting more and more confused, until eventually Rachel mentions the baby and they realize what the other was talking about.
<ul><li> On another episode, Rachel reads a book about female empowerment that refers to women's power as their "wind", which is constantly stolen by men. Ross asks her if she's ready to go to the movies and she says no, she will not let him steal her wind. Ross hasn't read the book and has no clue what she's talking about.

Jesse, however, thought they were talking about a big upcoming gig he had gotten. It got really hilarious when Jesse said that it resulted from natural talent and him constantly practicing in garages, living rooms, etc. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverInnocentEyesAndEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverInnocentEyesAndEars">causing Danny to cover D.J and Stephanie's ears</a>), followed by him wanting them to be there cheering for him all the way.

</li><li> Played with, as a technique, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. The characters will often hold two conversations simultaneously, seamlessly seguing from Conversation A to Conversation B, replying, and then seguing back to Conversation A. Lather, rinse, and repeat. However, every time, everyone knows what the other person is talking about, as Conversation A is about the medical case, and Conversation B is usually the cast social dynamics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Sorry, Bro", Marshall needed a new pair of pants and Lily brought them to the workplace, only to run into Barney. Barney being Barney assumed she was there to give Marshall something else. Their conversation ends with Barney thinking that Lily wanted <em>him</em> to give Marshall that "something else."
</li><li> Also in "Mary the Paralegal", when Ted and Mary are retiring to their hotel room. Mary, who really <em>is</em> a paralegal, has no idea that Ted thinks she's a prostitute hired by Barney:

Well, look, let's just... have a few drinks... we'll relax... <br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long. <br/><strong>Ted:</strong> Must be tough. <br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Yeah, I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about anal! <br/><em>[Ted is horrified]</em>
</div><ul><li> And again in "I'm Not That Guy", when an interviewer from an adult magazine mistakenly calls Ted instead of the porn star who shares Ted's name. Ted thinks he's being interviewed for an architecture magazine:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Ted:</strong> Wow, I've been reading your magazine since I was a little kid! <br/><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Oh. ...That's a bummer.

</li><li> An episode of the Russian medical sitcom <em>Interns</em> has two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">Bykov</a>'s interns: Lobanov and Romanenko, get together for a drink. Why? Lobanov overheard Bykov and Kisegach (Romanenko's mother and the hospital administrator) discussing her pregnancy with Bykov's child, which Romanenko doesn't know about. Meanwhile, Romanenko is asked by Lobanov's ex-wife Olga to tell Lobanov that she's pregnant from the one night when they got back together. They start talking about kids and how great they are, trying to lead up to the big news. Romanenko ends up dropping the bomb first. Lobanov is too shocked to do the same and leaves.

Charlie then confronts Mac and Dennis about it, thinking they're trying to go into the pastry business with the Chinese fish factory across the street. It takes them a while to figure out the miscommunication.

</li><li> One skit done by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeyAndPeele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeyAndPeele">Key &amp; Peele</a></em> has Key and Peele texting each other, with Key mistaking Peele's text for rude and apathetic, when Peele mistakes Key's texts for calm and casual.

The mark for the episode, a journalist, has been steered towards a politician to ask about an alleged government project called "Destiny". The Destiny that he thinks she means is his favourite stripper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matador1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matador1978">Matador</a></em> has a rather amusing example. The Varnæs family is talking about Hitler's death, when Misse steps in a mentions a death. The Varnæses assume she's talking about Hitler too, but it turns out that she's talking about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her husband, Professor Andersen.</span>

</li><li> And again, when Gloria is trying to apologize to Claire for accidentally sending a rude email, and Claire is talking about the kids walking in on her and Phil having sex. By the end of it, they think Gloria is offering a threesome with them.
</li><li> After Jay accidentally insults a pair of vacation acquaintances, Gloria tells them he's going senile. Then they try to talk to Manny about it, beginning with "We hear he's a little off his game," which gets Manny thinking they're talking about Jay's golf skills ("He does swear a lot. The worst is when he goes in the woods.").
</li><li> And again, after Phil sticks an advertisement for his business (selling houses) on his van, that makes his wife and Haley <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForProstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForProstitute">look like hookers</a>, and gets a lot of phone calls as a result: "Well, I think the carpeting matches the drapes; I haven't checked in a while.

When C.J replies in the negative, it clearly sinks in for her that a chapter of her life is ended, and while the tourist is just innocently conversing with someone who he thinks must just have had some business there, C.J's responses, while honest, are loaded with wistfulness and significance that he obviously can't pick up on.

But the inspector also needs Erik's signature. He asks his friend Normann to do this, but the attempt is thwarted as Normann is forced to take on another role as the inspector mentions other people and Erik begins lying about them too. This leads to him and Normann having to play various fake roles in order to cover up the fraud as more and more oblivious people arrive at the scene and begin asking questions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as they take on more and more ridiculous personality traits and come up with more and more complex excuses.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em>, Cleveland is trying to find a friend for his son, Cleveland Jr. He walks up to one boy and asks him if wants to play with Cleveland Jr. The predictable reaction ensues.

His follow-up "It's okay, Stewie had some too!" only made things worse.
<ul><li> In another episode, Stewie hears Meg's new "boyfriend", Kent, reveal that he is gay and has a crush on Meg's brother. Stewie is convinced that it's <em>him</em> he's talking about, though really it's Chris. Later, he and Brian, the latter of whom knowing the truth, have a conversation regarding the topic, and both think the other talker is referring to a different brother.

Meanwhile, Wilma and the Rubbles hear of Fred allegedly going around town with lots of cash, leading to a confrontation where Barney calls out "Fred" for acting like a rude, stuck-up jerk, while Gotrocks thinks he's one of his associates come to take him back to the office.

Goofy, on the other hand, thinks he's working as a janitor, and that the chimp is training <em>him</em>. Neither party catches wise to the other's beliefs, even when Goofy wins the Nobel Prize.

</li><li> The main plot of "Jared has Aides", the joke being that Jared actually means "aides", as in a dietitian and a personal trainer, and not "AIDS", the disease. Jared thinks that everyone is angry because he didn't actually lose his weight solely by eating Subway, when, well, why do you think people might be upset when Jared goes around saying that he "wants to give everyone in the world aides"?
</li><li> A similar gag worked in "Simpsons Did It", where the boys think that Sea-People and Semen (aka Sea-Men) are interchangeable. This leads to one of these conversations with Chef, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">whose initial reaction is to push the couch (with the boys on it) outside his house and close the door</a>.

When she fainted from grief in class, she was sent to the school nurse, where she babbled a bit about her hamster (but in incomplete sentences) and ended by saying "Grandma went bye-bye." The nurse then promptly spread word that Elmyra's grandmother passed, leading to a bunch of people arriving at the Duff household for an impromptu wake. Nearly every conversation with the Duff family regarding the deceased falls into this for the rest of the episode.
