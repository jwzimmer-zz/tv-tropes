Their secret weapon is a simple two-word philosophy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "I Won't"</span>. By the time the commanders of the ship realize how infectious the locals way of thinking and living is, half the enlisted men on the ship have gone AWOL and disappeared into the local population while half of those left are locked up drunk in the brig chanting the philosophy over and over in defiance. The Federation ship is forced to depart immediately, lest they lose any more essential crew-man and end up stranded because they can't even run the ship. They end up classifying the world as not worth conquering with a dangerously insane culture that warrants a social quarantine to prevent it spreading and infecting other places.

<ul><li> This tends to be a common occurrence throughout the <em>The Bible</em>.

This brings about many an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise">Superweapon Surprise</a> when the army of several hundred trained soldiers get slaughtered by a single farmhand with the Power of God.

It is kept hidden and unused until the last possible moment due to its extremely devastating effects (it burns starships from the inside out, cooking the crew alive). However, when the alien races are massing in force and defeat seems inevitable, the weapon is fired, and the resulting horror and surprise annihilation of the entire enemy fleet scare the other races into submission. The humans become rulers of known space, and force everyone to live peacefully in alliance, or else. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is later subverted when it comes out that Circe does not in fact exist. The enemy armies were just <em>incredibly</em> unlucky: in a ridiculously unlikely coincidence, a solar flare erupted from a nearby star, found the enemy fleet in its path, and bathed it in extreme amounts of radiation. The human government decided to work this in its favour and spun up the Circe superweapon story. As a new threat looms closer and closer, and everyone expects the humans to defend the alliance and defeat the invaders with the fearsome weapon, the human government finds itself in a bit of a pickle.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em>Look to Windward</em>, free floating "airspheres" out amongst the stars host megafauna: extremely long-lived zeppelin-like creatures called behemothaurs. While intelligent, they appear to be easy targets. However, a mysterious [[ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionalTraveler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionalTraveler">Dimensional Traveler</a> transcendent race]] looks over the apparently hapless gasbags: any who mess with them tend to go extinct across this entire plane of reality (and possibly other planes as well).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Excession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Excession">Excession</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a> puts whole war fleets in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedBadassInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedBadassInACan">deep storage</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretGovernmentWarehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretGovernmentWarehouse">inside of asteroids</a> &amp; other inconspicuous places after their last big war.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRDickson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRDickson">Gordon R. Dickson</a>:
<ul><li> In <em>The Alien Way</em>, an aggressive alien race discovers Earth by analysis of floating space debris and launches a covert surveillance mission as a prelude to invasion. Sadly for the aliens, humans not only know about them, they deliberately left those debris and used the alien mission as a tool to psychologically profile the would-be conquerors and find out all about <em>their</em> civilization and military capabilities. Then humans sent images of starships ready to strike the alien homeworld and an offer of peace.
</li><li> The short story "3-part Puzzle": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the galactic overlords decide humans are too dangerous, are about to organise to wipe the out, and get the first message ever from a telepathic, invulnerable race - NO</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Several stories in Christopher Anvil's Interstellar Patrol setting used this trope:
<ul><li> In one, a human colony of pacifists not in the main human government is targeted for conquest by a nasty species. Turns out the colony is composed of people who don't want to fight because they are so badass that if they don't keep themselves under tight control they'd waste their own planet.
</li><li> Another featured a peaceful, agrarian, planet. Where the local farmers had such bioengineering skill that the plants could eat the invading spaceships, let alone their organic crews.
</li><li> And yet another peaceful planet topped that. Hard to successfully invade a world where the inhabitants have the ability to mentally control tectonics and the weather.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInvertedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInvertedWorld">The Inverted World</a></em>, the inhabitants of the City regard the native "tooks" as hopelessly primitive, and savagely exploit them. Then it turns out the villages they've encountered so far were just the most badly impoverished in the area — word of the City's rape and pillage has spread to other villages, ones that have rifles and grenades...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutOfTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutOfTheDark">Out of the Dark</a></em> has one that <em>neither</em> side was expecting. The alien Shongairi have invaded Earth and thoroughly trounced the conventional militaries of Earth. They hit a bit of a brick wall when trying to <em>occupy</em> Earth, however, as their weapons are designed to fight lower-tech enemies due to galactic laws against conquering technologically-advanced worlds. However, the war's outcome is still inevitable because the Shongairi sit in orbit and drop rocks on any major human military force. Things look grim for mankind, up until Mircea Basarab, leader of one of the human resistance groups, finally takes off the kid gloves and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> reveals he is <em>freaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a></em></span> and proceeds to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> take his cadre of vampires and whup the Shongairi's collective asses.</span> Who the hell saw <em>that</em> coming?
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlastairReynolds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlastairReynolds">Alastair Reynolds</a>' novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PushingIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PushingIce">Pushing Ice</a></em>, the alien "McKinley" mentions this as one reason why they want to establish trade with the humans instead of just blasting them and taking what they want.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>: The planet of Exocron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Vision Of The Future</a></em> is defended by a pretty pitiful defense fleet, which doesn't stand much of a chance against the powerful slaver fleet which tracked the protagonists there. However, it turns out the slavers were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">deliberately led to Exocron</a>; the Aing-Tii monks, Force-users who usually don't go out of their territory but hate slavers, pop into orbit and, with their weird alien tech, waste the attacking fleet in a matter of minutes, then promptly leave again.
</li><li> Although never attacked, China in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a> books is considered to be this. They have no standing army, and their dragons are more interested in poetry and math than warfare, but their breeding skills are remarkable so their dragons are all superior to their non-Chinese counterparts, and they have a lot more, so if they were attacked, they can easily conscript a massive army.
<ul><li> This exact fate befell Francisco Pizzaro when he tried to conquer the Inca.

When every non-violent attempt at bringing them under the heel of typical culture fails absurdly in the face of the colonists' laid back outlook on life, the military might of the expedition is brought to bear... Only for an incredibly powerful weapon hidden in a crater on the planet's moon to blast it into oblivion. Interestingly the military delay their move until the colonists' orbiting spacecraft is on the other side of the planet, in the belief that it's a hidden-in-plain-sight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">Tool Conversion</a> weapon.

The colonists demonstrate that they are much more savvy and strategic than the military gave them credit for. They co-opt all the ground force as they can. When final mutiny aboard the miltiary warship begins, the colonist wait for the most dangerous hard-liners to make their escape in a shuttle craft. They knew that the worse rats would have a plan to flee the ship when it sinks; the General Ripper, his most essential loyalists and those that could pay for the privilege to abandon their fellow expeditionists. Then they blow the shuttle craft out of the sky. This is what is known as a decapitation strike.

</li><li> The US, and later with help from the UN, was this to South Korea during the outbreak of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>. While the North Korean military was armed with the latest in Soviet weaponry, the South Koreans had little support from the US at first, and as a result, the North Koreans managed to deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to the South until they overstretched their supply lines and were pushed back by the UN/South Korean forces. Today, while South Korea's military is no longer the pushover it was during the 1950's, the US still has a defense treaty with them should North Korea take any aggressive actions against the South.
<ul><li> And on a similar note, China acts as this for North Korea, having assisted them militarily in pushing the UN forces out of North Korea to prevent a total collapse of the North Korean regime.
</li></ul></li><li> Like Costa Rica, Iceland has no standing army. However, it's a member state of NATO, meaning that should it ever be attacked by another power, the United States and most of Western Europe can be expected to come to its defense. NATO militaries even take turns on active duty protecting them.
<ul><li> Luxembourg is in a similar position.
</li></ul></li><li> Canada. While not any more or less militant than most first-world countries, their biggest means of defense even before their own armed forces is that they're right next to the almost absurdly well-armed United States of America. Any serious threat to Canada, pretty much by definition, would be at least as dangerous to the US, which would respond in kind.
<ul><li> Mexico is protected precisely the same way. The fact that Canada and Mexico are the second and third largest energy suppliers to the US (after the US itself) doesn't hurt.
</li></ul></li><li> Really, this applies to almost any country in the Americas, which are now the USA's economic and strategic backyard. Though a long standing (all the way to Monroe) U.S. policy, the USA has only really had the power to back it up in the last hundred years or so - <em>Chile</em> had a bigger and better fleet than the USA until the late 19th century. In any case, as it stands every country in the Americas except Cuba is almost guaranteed to pull one of these off in the form of US intervention - unless the USA itself <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama">invades<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada">otherwise interferes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with you, of course. The threat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunboatDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunboatDiplomacy">the latter</a> came with the presence of the former, actually.
</li><li> Austria seems like a weak country in the middle of Europe with no army to speak of. They aren't even a part of the NATO. However they have a defensive pact with the USA, Russia, the UK and France.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence">Wars of Italian Independence</a>, the Kingdom of Sardinia and its successor state the Kingdom of Italy were after the Papal States, both because they contained Italy's traditional capital of Rome and due the erratic behaviour of the reigning Pope, Pius IX, but in spite of clear military superiority, most decisively demonstrated when the Sardinian Army overran most of it in <em>days</em> in 1860, they didn't move against Rome itself, and even protected it from Garibaldi's attempts to do just that. That was because Napoleon III, ruler of the Second French Empire, had in his interest to preserve the Pope's independence and threatened military action to protect Rome (and his garrison in the Eternal City <em>did</em> fight the one time Garibaldi managed to slip past Italian surveillance), and given France was both military superior and the closest thing Italy had to a real ally the Italian government didn't move but just tried to settle the relationship. This ended up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>, as Pius IX took the French protection as license to continuously provoke the "subalpine usurper", much to Napoleon's own chagrin, until in 1870 France lost the French-Prussian War <em>badly</em> and couldn't protect Rome anymore, at which point Italy <em>immediately</em> invaded and conquered Rome, proclaimed it the new capital, and relegated Pius IX in what would later become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VaticanCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VaticanCity">Vatican City</a>.

Even as they survive in their last city, all other cities taken over by humans, they refuse to consider using their arsenal of highly advanced weapons, using only weapons comparable to the primitive middle age weapons the humans have. Even if it means their extinction as a race. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ekrose</span> convinces them to use their weapons, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> is a severe understatement.

As it turns out, Dabog hasn't always been the pleasant world it is now. The colonists had to fight tooth and nail to tame it and built a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">servomachines</a> for that purpose. Centuries later, only one remains in operating condition, the <em>Golden Eagle</em> (<em>Aquila</em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">English translation</a>). Its pilot Igor Rokotov takes it out of the bunker collapsed by the nuclear destruction of the nearby city and engages the PCVs nearby. The <em>Eagle</em>'s cruiser-grade lasers and AI-assisted controls turn out to be far superior to the mechanized troops the Alliance has deployed, and the staggering losses force the admiral in command of the invasion to pull back to high orbit. Unfortunately, this wouldn't safe the planet, as the protracted siege results in the sustained nuclear bombardment of the planet, which wipes out all life on the surface and leaves Dabog as the testament to colonial defiance and the Alliance's ruthlessness. Meanwhile, the Alliance quickly realizes the paradigm shift in ground warfare that servomachines represent and start producing their own, with the Free Colonies making copies of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>.

They threaten to use it in the event of an invasion. Turns out it's just a bluff, which no one seems to be buying. Then, in the middle of the invasion, an American destroyer disappears and reappears in orbit. The President couldn't sign the order to pull out troops fast enough.

They invade, only to find out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust">reaction drives and solar sail launching lasers are actually pretty good at blowing things up</a>. Surprise! This is referred to as the Kzinti lesson: "The more efficient a reaction drive, the more effective a weapon it makes." Related is Jon's Law which states "<em>any</em> interesting space drive is a weapon of mass destruction".
</li><li> On at least one occasion a Bussard Ramjet ship <em>itself</em> was used as a RKV (Relativistic Kill Vehicle).
</li><li> The Wunderlanders managed to turn a mining tool into a weapon that carved a giant divot into a planet. A "divot" large enough to be visible from space, and deep enough to hold half the atmosphere and change the planet's ecology. It's called the "Wunderland Treatymaker". And when humanity annexed the planet, they renamed it "Canyon" for obvious reasons.
</li><li> Personal communication lasers are just tight beams for sending encoded messages. Shooting from the ground to a ship in orbit requires a bit of power to prevent blooming and errors, so the dial goes from "very low" to "reach orbit". Shooting it at someone 20 yards away when you're using the "reach orbit" setting yields... spectacular results.
</li><li> An even more spectacular variant can be seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FleetOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FleetOfWorlds">Fleet of Worlds</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an <em>interstellar</em> communications laser, aimed very precisely, is used to achieve the impossible: destroy a General Products hull. The Puppeteers are convinced that their pet humans have somehow obtained antimatter, since General Products hulls are invulnerable to anything less.</span>
</li><li> The Puppeteers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> deny they carry any weapons at all, though it's something of a half-truth. For instance, their flashlight-laser just illuminates dark places. Don't tighten the focus too much, though: someone could get hurt. Louis Wu lampshades this fact in-universe. As Nessus is pointing out the devices he has brought on the expedition, and says "this is not a weapon", Louis notes the different ways they can still be used as weapons. Wu nicknames the ship "The Lying Bastard". Even a Puppeteer's natural weaponry is an example of this. Puppeteers are constantly running from trouble, not just because they're cowards, but because their physiology allows them to deliver backwards kicks that can kill people. Still mostly because they're cowards, though. Only insane Puppeteers actually bother with the lethal kick when they could be sprinting over the horizon. Which is sad, because the times we've seen a Puppeteer kick someone has always been awesome.
</li><li> Human beings themselves, along with other mutated hominids, can be considered a Superweapon Surprise, seeings as they can, if they ingest enough Tree of Life, transform into Protectors, the (presumed to be lost) third developmental phase which features heightened intelligence, superhuman strength, increased pain tolerance, biological immortality, and an uncontrollable compulsion to protect members of their respective species.

The Psilons invade and quickly subdue the colonists, waving off their feeble attempts at resistance. The protagonist finds one of the four bunkers used for planetary defense (the other three were destroyed by the Psilons during the initial bombing run) and manages to kill several Psilons in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>. Just as the rest of the colonists are about to be executed (the Psilons don't keep prisoners and only enslave those who have shown they can kill them), they offhandedly kill a member of the primitive indiginous race. Suddenly, a large number of the natives shows up and <em>slices the battleship in half</em> with a combined directed microwave attack. It was previously mentioned that anyone who slights a native can be fried to a crisp using their biological ability to emit directed microwaves. It's just that nobody thought that they could do that to a massive warship.

Earth laughs; the moon doesn't have the military capability to keep out Terran police. The Moon demonstrates that the Catapult (essentially a giant railgun) it uses to send grain shipments to Earth can also be used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">drop big rocks on military targets and major cities</a>. Also, converted mining lasers make reasonably good point-defence guns when properly cradled and controlled by a sapient super-computer.
<ul><li> The Catapult is somewhat of a subversion, as during the talks the Moonies did warn they were able to do just that (there was still a massacre, but that was owed by media spinning it as a ridiculous bluff, with thousands putting themselves in the targeted areas in defiance and getting disintegrated for that). The real surprise came when the Terran spaceships managed to disable it... And the Moonies unveiled the one they had built in secret. Earth surrendered soon after.

After the aforementioned escape, the New Republic finds itself in possession of the worst weapon of mass destruction the universe has ever seen. This is decidedly against its principles, so the craft is ordered destroyed - which is somewhat difficult to achieve, considering it can withstand the pressure at the core of a star without a scratch.

This, combined with the Vasari's failure to scout ahead far enough before invading TEC space, causes the Vasari to severely underestimate them, thinking that they are just another small, low-tech race to eradicate. The Vasari then attack a human system, and have to fight tooth and nail against cargo ships and merchant vessels retrofitted as warships, but finally take it.

Though the US always had tiny standing military forces relatively to just about everybody else, they remained small even as the country developed into a local, then regional, and eventually global power. This is because after around about the 1850s, the country's geography and economy began to serve as its greatest defensive assets. That is to say the US was a relatively large country quite far removed from any potential threats, one that began to develop a prosperous and largely insular economy with decent infrastructure to boot. After the mid-19th century an embargo or blockade began to be of limited effectiveness because the country (the north, at any rate) was its own greatest customer, and an invasion would be tricky for reasons which are also rather obvious. The US was not unique in its ability to make use of female labour or in terms of the convertability of its factories, but it was the sheer size of the country's burgeoning population and well-developed industrial base that allowed them to pull this economic trick off so dramatically in the course of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>.

The British had taken a considerable hammering in France and had little in the way of proper equipment to spare for the newly-formed Local Defence Volunteers... But it so happened that the majority of said Volunteers were farm workers, exempt from conscription as they were performing essential war work. Farm workers tend to own shotguns and small-caliber rifles for pest control and sometimes hunting small game, and use them often enough to be quite good with them.
<ul><li> Also, Britain after the evacuation of Dunkirk had a lot of fuel backed up, and found after a bit of experimentation that it could be very useful, especially when barrels of the stuff could be set alight. Tests also proved that pressure-greasing equipment, when fueled with liquid a bit more runny than grease, made short-ranged but rather effective flamethrowers.

The latter two are usually very well trained and the former is dangerous because of a lack of training.

Turned out the barges were the first-ever galleasses: large merchant barges that the Venetians had armed with 36 guns on the sides (a galley, the standard warship on both sides, embarked four, two fore and two aft, all smaller than the ones on the galleasses). When the Ottomans managed to get away, they had lost <em>70 out of their 206 galleys</em> and their formation was in disarray, and the galleasses were intact.

It proceeds to blow up a good number of Nazi warships before it gets overwhelmed and requests help. Cue dozens of armed spaceships from <em>all</em> other nations (except Finland), which proceed to obliterate the Nazi space fleet. Oh, and one of those ships is the supposedly-destroyed <em>Mir</em> station. Then comes the Nazi flagship <em>Götterdämmerung</em>, a gigantic war machine that is so overpowered and complex that the most powerful Nazi computer (the size of a room) can't control its systems. But an iPad app can. When unleashed, it simply flies through the Earth fleet, smashing a number of the ships on its windshield.

On the remote outskirts of god-forsaken planet, in the huge desert, a small bunch of ragtag people scavenge for a living. Do not get trigger-happy yet: those people are, in fact, bred by their demanding enviroment to be the best fighters in Universe. And their numbers are seriously underestimated... Long story short, a hundred years and several books after being bothered, they sweep their Jihad holy crusade across the Galaxy. Woops!
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, with an alien race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> called the Pemalites. The Pemalites had great technological power, and used it only for peaceful and playful purposes. They were invaded and destroyed by another race called the Howlers. It's explained that they could have forged their plowshares into swords, could have repelled their invasion, but they chose not to do it because they couldn't bring themselves to become violent killers. So they were destroyed, and their memory is a cautionary tale against the dangers of pacifism. In a later addition, it turns out that they were created by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Ellimist</a>, and learned to have such an overwhelming love for life that they could never kill.
<ul><li> Played straight with the Pemalites' androids, the Chee. Although simarly loaded with pacifist protocols, they are are super strong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Animorphs use a crystal to turn off said protocols, leading Erek to take and kill more Hork Bajir than the entire GROUP can manage.

Previously, only Romulans and Suliban had the tech, and they weren't sharing. The advantage is first demonstrated, when the Admiral's flagship arrives, and the Admiral attempts to negotiate with the Klingons. The Klingon leader pretends to agree to a ceasefire, then a cloaked ship with a giant prow rams the Admiral's ship, cleaving it in half. Slightly subverted in that the ship's crew manages to overload its warp core, taking the Klingon ram-ship with them. Later on, the cloaking tech is disseminated throughout the Klingon fleet, making their ships all the more dangerous. That's why it's all the more important when the <em>Discovery</em> pulls the same trick on them with its experimental spore drive.

Most of the game involves a hunt for what you think is a superweapon. The <em>actual</em> super weapon turns out to be a race of seemingly-harmless aliens that perform various menial tasks.

No, really. Unfortunately, it really is <em>only</em> an activation key — it provides no control, so the new supersoldiers rampage through the ship this was tested on and you have to reroute it into the nearest star and escape alive.

The Terrans responded by rapidly militarizing and beating the Xendar all the way back to their homeworld, at which point the Drengin exterminated the Xendar so their involvement would not become known (all other races assumed that the Terrans wiped out the Xendar).

The Suul'ka in question are the insane Liir elders who in an attempt to avoid their inevitable death by crushing enslave the entire Liir race and run them through rapid industrialization in order to have them build a massive spacesuit they can live in. After the last time this happened the Liir rose, led by the Black and decided that they weren't going to let that happen any more. Oh and that they were going to go ahead and get rid of those insane elders already in space. Cue most of the Suul'ka dying. A few got away though and as of <em>Sword of the Stars 2</em>, they're back.
<ul><li> The bioweapon used to destroy them also turned out to be a tad bit bigger than the viruses they more commonly use. As in, it was effectively a "good" Suul'ka.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a> has a rather weird case in the city of Mechanicsburg, which was the home of the Heterodyne dynasty - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Sparks</a> crazy even by the Sparks' standards. This obviously means the city is, in fact, a death trap looking like a city. However, since the dynasty is presumed to have died out and only a Heterodyne can properly use it, nobody expects the stuff to be used. Then, Klaus Wulfenbach (ruler of most of Europe due to his politics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">"don't make me come over there"</a>) is incapacitated - in Mechanicsburg. This quickly starts a free-for-all war with Mechanincsburg as the battleground. Guess what happens.
<ul><li> Then, the armies actually overcome the resistance; weakened, but still too powerful to beat...and then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Jägers</a> arrive.
</li><li> Played with in the case of the Baron. Although Wulfenbach has no lack of conventional weaponry and troops, it's actually the <em>unconventional</em> stuff you should be <em>really</em> afraid of: his highway construction, fire-fighting, and communication units. Construction machinery which can liquefy solid rock, firefighters equipped with freeze-cannons that can crack open fortresses, and long-range light signal airships, which when focused at closer range can incinerate anything on the ground. His troops can take over cities. His non-combat units can make cities cease to exist.
</li><li> To some degree, stronger Sparks are walking potential armies with the stuff they can create. This is explicitly mentioned for the Heterodynes (being very strong Sparks). Every strategist will give you the same advice (and they have done so for centuries): Whatever you do, <em>do not</em> give the Heterodynes time. Strategically speaking, they are machines that turn "Time" into "<strong>Death. Lots of it.</strong>"

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder31');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder31" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The possibility of atomic weaponry had been theorized by every major power in the war, but the Germans believed it wouldn't make a noticeable difference in the war (and they kept drafting their best physicists and sending them to die in battle, as well as dismissing some of the underlying scientific theory as 'Jewish Physics'), the Japanese didn't quite have the gear and the resources they'd have needed and the Soviets couldn't spare the necessary resources while also trying to defend from Germany. It came as a surprise to everyone when the US turned out to have achieved the unachievable.
<ul><li> The Kamikaze, the Kaiten torpedo, and the Baka bomb. At a stage when the US had already essentially won the war as long as they kept fighting, these suicide weapons were a most unpleasant surprise.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> (as in <em>real</em> Ninja) weapons were all derived from farm implements and often disguised and used as such so that they can carried and used in the open. Keep in mind that, at least from the beginning, Ninja were strictly defensive clans allied against oppressive samurai.
<ul><li> The shillelagh, in Ireland (and, no, not the little, short cudgels passed off to tourists as shillelaghs, nowadays). The knob on the end of that "walking stick" can pack quite a wallop, especially if it's filled with lead (referred to as a "loaded" stick). Though it could be argued that this doesn't apply that well to the trope in general, as few with any sense of history would describe the Irish as "peaceful".
</li></ul></li><li> The First Opium War. In response to the imprisonment of British merchants and the destruction of their merchandise by the Qing, the British dispatched the HMS <em>Nemesis</em>. This was a brand, spanking-new, iron-hulled steamer that far outclassed anything the Qing had, and this is not counting the fact that some other British ships possessed more guns than <em>entire Chinese fleets</em>. The conflict, which heavily revolved around the use of naval power, was ridiculously lopsided in favour of the British and served to highlight just how far Europe had advanced (and how much the Qing had declined).
</li><li> Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands because the islands were completely undefended (the only British "military" asset stationed there at the time was an Antarctic research ship, and even that was about to be pulled out) and they believed the British simply had no real desire to try to retake them, especially in the face of proposed defense cuts. Then they invaded; then the British got pissed, and sent anything they could to the South Atlantic, including postponing the retirement of their Vulcan bombers (and pulling some out of the boneyards), originally scheduled for retirement early that year and doing an emergency cancellation of the sale of the aircraft carrier HMS <em>Hermes</em> (one of only two the Royal Navy had at the time) to the Indians when the ink was still drying (and completely scrapping the sale of the other one, HMS <em>Invincible</em>, to the Aussies), so you can argue it fits the above trope as well.
</li><li> New Zealand has a very small military, retiring the last of their tactical combat aircraft in 2002 and their largest warships are under-gunned frigates; yet they possess some of the most respected, well-trained and highly capable special forces teams in the world (some have argued they're better than what the US can put out), and have been on nearly continuous overseas deployment during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> and since the turn of the millenium.
<ul><li> Australian soldiers are renowned for being very professional and excellent at teamwork (though not always at taking orders). Small population countries do the best with what they have.
</li><li> Canada also has such a force, known as the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Task_Force_2">Joint Task Force 2<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Little is known about them, but they're among the most, if not <em>the</em> most competent special task force in the world despite having an estimated 600 soldiers. They also legally do not exist, as each member is stripped of their identity upon joining. The name of only one member is known, and that was only revealed after his accidental death.

Good bankers and watchmakers. Want to stomp on them? Feel like walking into a small, mountainous region where every able-bodied male is conscripted into the military when they turn eighteen, serves until the age of thirty (sure, it's only three weeks a year, not unlike the National Guard, but still), and is required to keep an assault rifle and 50 rounds in his house at all times? Many choose to retain their service weapons as hunting rifles as well... About the only thing dumber than an invasion of Switzerland would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">starting a land war in Asia</a>.
<ul><li> A famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Swiss General:</strong> If you invade us, we can mobilize half a million men to defend our country within two days.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Wehrmacht General:</strong> And what if the Fuehrer invades your country with one million men?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Swiss General:</strong> We will all shoot twice, then go home.
</div></li><li> Not to mention that most of the country is loaded with hidden artillery, explosives (especially in avalanche prone areas) and even the country's bridges are rigged to explode to make invading that little bit harder.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite the fact that their constitution explicitly prohibits militarization, Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" are in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.globalfirepower.com/">top ten largest militaries in the world.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> They could probably pull it off in a literal sense too. While Japan constitutionally prohibits nuclear weapons, they have all the materials, expertise and industry to make one, possibly developing a fusion bomb inside a few <em>months</em>. For comparison, the US took 12 years to develop a deployable fusion weapon, and China "only" took about six. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-nuclear-plutonium-idUSKCN0WO0R5">Japan periodically ships weapons grade plutonium to the United States for destruction<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, largely to keep China and Korea less grumbly about the Japanese stockpiling <em>50 TONS</em> of the stuff (a byproduct from decades of nuclear power plant use).
</li><li> Japan also counts the US as a military ally and hosts American military bases on its soil. While current treaty obligations prohibit the Americans from stationing any nuclear weapons in Japan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo">for reasons that should be obvious</a>), the alliance itself could prove quite useful should Japan ever find itself attacked by one of its neighbors (such as, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Israel essentially pulled this in the Six-Day War.
</li><li> Half a century later, Lebanon's Hizbollah pulled something similar. Not so much Superweaponing as massive Underdogging.
</li><li> Finland during the Winter War. The Soviet Union was certain they could conquer the entire country within a span of few weeks. Instead, the plucky little place resisted for a hundred days and made their enemy pay a heavy price for every mile they acquired. Technically the Soviets did win, and they could have kept going and eventually crush the Finns, but it more than qualifies regardless. Besides, Finland had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimoHayha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimoHayha">Simo Häyhä</a>, who practically qualifies as a superweapon in his own right.
<ul><li> Amusingly (well, in a grim way, but still) it worked for the Soviets as well. Hitler was so unimpressed with their performance against the Finland, he was convinced it was safe to invade and that he would curbstomp the Union just as he had done with Europe. Boy, was he in for a surprise.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> when the Japanese grabbed an atlas, took a look at the size of Australia and believed that a successful land invasion would be utterly impossible. Even if every able bodied Aussie alive at the time was armed and ready, they still wouldn't have enough troops to defend themselves as their population was only a bit over 7 million. Even now, they only have a bit under 22 million (the majority of the population is within a couple hundred miles of an ocean coast - the inland is primarily desert and almost entirely unpopulated). On the flipside, they do have large uranium deposits and the know-how to make them into something explosive.
<ul><li> Not to mention that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">Australia</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">The country itself arguably qualifies as a weapon.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The siege of Syracuse 215 B.C. . What was supposed to be a quick assault turned into a three year siege. Credited to the wonderful devices of Archimedes. As the biographer Plutarch put it "When, therefore, the Romans came up under the walls, thinking themselves unnoticed, once more they encountered a great storm of missiles; huge stones came tumbling down upon them almost perpendicularly, and the wall shot out arrows at them from every point; they therefore retired.... . At last, the Romans became so fearful that, whenever they saw a bit of rope or a stick of timber projecting a little over the wall, There it is, they cried, Archimedes is training some engine upon us, and turned their backs and fled."
<ul><li> Other accounts also include hidden hooks and pulleys that could tear ships apart if they got too close to the walls and arrays of mirrors used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Rays</a> by focusing sunlight to burn ships.
</li></ul></li><li> Italy is not normally known for its military courage, but it has its moments:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> they initially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a></em> it by not entering the war on the side of their allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary (had they done it, the French army would have been too overstretched to stop either the Germans or the Italians). Then they entered the war on the side of the Entente, but by then everybody was expecting it;
</li><li> In 1917 the Austro-Hungarians had finally broken through Italian lines at Caporetto and were marching on the valley where most of the Italian weapons were and still are made... Only to stumble on a massif fortified with thousands of guns. In the same days, the routed Italian soldiers running from the main Austro-Hungarian force suddenly realized that their homes were under attack, stopped running, and started fighting like demons (an Italian brigade was actually nicknamed 'Demons' by the Austro-Hungarians due their ferocity), with the Austro-Hungarian invasion being stopped dead on its tracks;
</li><li> During the war, the Italians pulled a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToolConversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToolConversion">Tool Conversion</a> by creating the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAS_%28boat%29">MAS boats<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, basically large civilian motorboats with a machine gun and two torpedoes strapped on them. The Austro-Hungarians laughed... Then a couple MAS sank an Austro-Hungarian pre-dreadnought battleship in harbour. Then three of them (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">the two of the previous attack</a> plus a third) penetrated the most guarded harbour in the world and fired torpedoes at the moored ships (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">they didn't sink because the high command had ordered to place torpedo nets after the first attack, just in case</a>). <em>Then</em> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">same two MAS of the first attack</a></em> stumbled on the Austro-Hungarian flagship and <em>sank her</em>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> the MAS didn't enjoy the same success because every possible target was looking for them and was liable to call for air support at the first sign;
</li><li> What did the Italians use to replace the MAS in World War II? The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_torpedo">Human torpedo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: a large torpedo with two divers steering it until they reached their targets, at which point they removed the limpet mine that replaced the warhead, placed it on the ship, and swam away before it blew up and sank the target. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Alexandria_%281941%29">One such raid disabled two battleships in harbour and damaged a tanker (plus a destroyer as collateral)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. After that, the Allies copied the concept... And the Royal Navy started dropping depth charge every time they suspected a raid (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">they thwarted at least one such raid this way</a>);
</li><li> In North Africa during World War II, many armies mounted light cannons on trucks. Not Italy. They mounted <a class="urllink" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/102/35_su_Fiat_634N">102mm naval guns taken from old destroyers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (link in Italian, sorry). To say that they came as a surprise for British tankers would be an understatement.
</li><li> At <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kasserine_Pass">Kasserine Pass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Americans believed they had stopped Rommel's counterattack; his German troops were exhausted, and all he had left were Italians. But the Italians were <em>Bersaglieri</em>, elite troops who Rommel considered superior to his German infantry; they attacked the American forces and showed that Rommel's appraisal was right.
