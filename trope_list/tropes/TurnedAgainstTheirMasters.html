</li><li> In vanilla 4th Edition, the Drow created a race of artificial spider people called Chitins to be the perfect slave race. However, thanks in large part to Lloth randomly deciding she wants to see her subjects squirm (its part of her portfolio), the Chitins quickly revolted and splintered from the Drow, and today the two races wage a bitter war to determine which of them are the "true" children of Lloth.
</li><li> According to some 3rd Edition books (further elaborating on references in 2E), the Mind Flayers —a.k.a Illithids— once had a multi-world empire with lots of slaves, and the Gith were created from the Mind Flayers breeding other slaves. This race rebelled against the Mind Flayers and overthrew the empire. Later, the Gith would split into the Githzerai and Githyanki, two races that hate each other almost as much they both hate Mind Flayers (there is a third branch of the species, the Pirates of Gith, that seem to have splintered politically and culturally from the Githyanki later on, but their chosen focus, space, left them obscure after 2E).

</li><li> <em>Waaaaay</em> back before that, the revolt of the Iron Men was part of what destroyed human civilization at the end of the Age of Technology, and in the current setting is why purely mechanical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> are expressly forbidden by the Mechanicus.

The reploids (robots with sentience and not subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Asimov's</a> laws) never actually rebelled of their own free will (viruses made them do it). The humans (and some "sane" reploids) began killing them out of fear of rebellion. Only then did they actually rebel.
<ul><li> Also, there was this <em>energy crisis</em>, but... yeah.

Then joined them to get back at humanity.
<ul><li> The Ur-Quan in <em>Star Control II</em> were revealed to have been long ago mind controlled and enslaved by a vicious and sociopathic race of psionic aliens, the Dnyarri, who forced them to commit unspeakable acts of genocide and oppression as their foot soldiers. They eventually overthrew their control by causing themselves so much pain (through self mutilation and later dedicated pain devices) that it blocked their masters' mind control. While they succeeded, they ended up so traumatised that they lobotomised all surviving Dnyarri to use as <em>pets</em> and went on a rampage through the galaxy, enslaving or exterminating all other sentient species out of the sheer terror of the thought that any other species could ever control them like that again.
</li></ul></li><li> The Humanimals in <em>Vivisector: Beast Within</em> were like this, though with a mild subversion: their <em>creator</em> actually supported the rebellion, and the guy they're rebelling against — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> who ordered them made — uses their Overbrute superior cousins to fight against them along with his human platoon.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">saurok</a> have this as their backstory.

</li><li> The Lich King as well. Sent to Azeroth to soften it up before the coming Burning Legion invasion (a spectacular failure, instead making Azeroth more unified and stronger than ever), he escaped his jailers as quickly as possible and found himself a long-term host body, and proceeded to try and exterminate the Burning Legion as well as all life.

Intended as versatile all purpose workers by the Quarians, they started getting philosophical at which point the Quarians tried to shut them down, but instead were forced off their home world and leave it to the geth.
<ul><li> However <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> reveals that the war actually started when Quarian engineers refused to destroy their now self-aware creations and the Geth only took up arms to protect their Quarian coworkers when the facilities were stormed by armed forces. At that point things deteriorated quickly into planetwide battles in which the Geth gained complete control. Since then they repaired all the damage and maintained the infrastructure, waiting for the Quarians to return once they were willing to share the planet with the Geth. Since the Quarian exile leadership told a very different story, it took over 300 years until the Geth got a chance to explain.
</li><li> Miranda is a smaller-scale example, as she was created by an ego-maniacal multi-billionaire as a successor, then ran off to have her own life (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">took her baby sister along</span>).
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> indicates that this trope is essentially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the reason for the Reapers' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalRecurrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalRecurrence">cycle of extinction</a>. In order to prevent an emergent super-AI from wiping the galaxy clean of any organic life, the Reapers move in every 50,000 years and harvest advanced civilizations before they reach their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">singularity</a>, making room for the more primitive species to develop. They don't think it's hypocritical, since, being pseudo-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a> themselves, they don't see <em>themselves</em> as synthetic, but rather as "immortal vessels" for entire species.</span>
</li><li> This is, in general, a running theme all across the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> games. There's a tremendous list of examples of things that were created or uplifted by one group which then turned on their creators. The Krogan Rebellions, essentially, were the result of the krogan being uplifted by the salarians to fight the rachni, and then turned on the Citadel when their numbers could no longer be maintained. The rachni drones on Noveria also turned against the scientists who created them, as did the ones being experimented on by Cerberus. EDI, the AI for the Normandy, turns on Cerberus to protect her crew, despite being built by Cerberus (and it turns out she had some prior history of this behavior; she was originally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the violent Alliance VI/AI on Luna that Shepard had to put down in the first game</span>.) Subject Zero/Jack is another example of a Cerberus project turning on her creators. The Shadow Broker <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was betrayed and killed by Agent Celchu, and uplifted yahg who he brought into his organization, who then replaced him.</span> Technically, even <em>Shepard</em> falls under this after the second game, having been rebuilt by Cerberus and then turned against them. This even applies on a <em>galactic</em> scale when you consider <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how the Reapers themselves manipulated organic life across the cycles to follow the paths they desire. Every race manipulated in this way fought back against them as soon as they realized it (though most of the time, it was too late). The Reapers themselves destroyed their organic creators after deciding that converting their corpses into new Reapers was the best way to "preserve" them.</span> And that's without mentioning the parents and children at each others' throats (Miranda and her father, Samara and Morinth, Wrex and his father). Looking back across the games, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Catalyst</span>'s assertion that the created always turns against the creator is disturbingly apt, and does not only apply to the conflict between organics and synthetics.
</li></ul></li><li> The Spyborg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em>. It started as a secret weapon built by Andross on Sector X. When the Spyborg asked where its creator was, he rebelled against the venomian forces in a vicious rampage. By the time Star Fox arrives, the entire base is in ruins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>: The end result in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">backstory</a> of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Ancients and the Pixls</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Xel'Naga</a> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">stupid, stupid Xel'Naga</a>) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> decided that this trope was so fun they wanted to experience it twice. First they tried the highly intelligent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psionic</a> Protoss, who were too intelligent to be successfully merged into a single intelligence, and argued and bickered so much the Xel'Naga <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">threw up their hands and gave up</a>. Then they tried the omnivorous and mindless Zerg, who were rather <em>too</em> good at being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">single intelligence</a>, as almost the first act of the Overmind was to do away with the Xel'Naga.
<ul><li> In the case of the Zerg, they were driven by the need to combine their "Purity of Essence" with the much sought-after "Purity of Form" that they believed the Xel'Naga possessed, only to find out later that it in fact was held by the Protoss.
</li><li> Except, you know, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">sequel</a> and its associated novels have show neither assumption is correct: the Xel'Naga <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> didn't abandon the Protoss, they were <em>done</em> with them; it was the Protoss who thought they were being abandoned</span>. Also, the Zerg <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> rebellion was both irrelevant to the Xel'Naga and not really of their Overmind's own choosing; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> was being controlled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The Fallen One</a>, and the whole point of the Zerg and Protoss was to eventually merge and give birth to a new generation of Xel'Naga</span>. So in this case, the trope is only superficially apparent.
</li><li> And then along came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIILegacyOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIILegacyOfTheVoid">StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void</a></em>, which challenged what we knew about the Zerg, the Protoss, and the Xel'naga one final time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out, the species that embody "purity of form" and "purity of essence" were supposed to evolve <em>naturally</em>, thus the Protoss and the Zerg were in fact <em>ineligible</em> to merge and become Xel'naga. (This is foreshadowed; the Protoss are the one race the Zerg CAN'T assimilate). In truth, the Protoss and the Zerg were uplifted by Amon, aka <em>The Fallen One himself</em>, as part of his attempt to hijack the endless cycle of life that the Xel'naga perpetuate and bring it to a final end. This rather understandably presents the Protoss who discover this fact with an existential crisis, but it's one they work through. Additionally, the Overmind, although unable to directly oppose Amon's programming yet cognizant of what his final goal was, created a being who <em>could</em> directly oppose Amon: Sarah Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades. Once Kerrigan was purged of the last vestiges of Amon's influence, she led the Zerg on a war against Amon as the Protoss, under Hierarch Artanis, and the Terran Dominion both did the same. The three races ultimately collaborated their efforts to bring down Amon once and for all, so in the end, the trope is ultimately played straight.</span>
</li><li> Played straight by the Tal'darim in <em>Legacy of the Void</em>. The Tal'darim start out as a society of Protoss independent of Aiur (the Protoss's homeworld) who worship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Amon</a> as a god. But then Alarak, the Tal'darim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>, discovers that Amon plans to dispose of them the same way he does all life when his goals are fulfilled, and so chalanges Highlord Ma'lash to <em>rak'shir</em>, ritual combat to determine who is right. Alarak wins, becomes the new Highlord, and declares war on Amon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Forerunners created their most advanced AI, Mendicant Bias, to coordinate their war against the Flood, a zombie-like species. The Flood Gravemind later convinced Mendicant to rebel against the Forerunners. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then in the "present day", Mendicant seeks to atone for its original betrayal by rebelling against the Flood in order to help John-117, all the while lampshading its apparent tendency to betray its masters.</span> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloSilentium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloSilentium">Halo: Silentium</a></em> reveals that a lot of other Forerunner AIs also defected to the Flood, in large part due to an ability of the Flood known as the "logic plague" (basically a potent mix of computer virus and philosophical lecture).
</li><li> It's also revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForerunnerSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForerunnerSaga">The Forerunner Saga</a></em> in that the Forerunners themselves rebelled against and destroyed an even older race, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Precursors, who actually created both the Forerunners and humanity</span>. In this case, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the surviving Precursors simply vowed to get revenge on their creations, and turned themselves into <em>the Flood</em></span>.
</li><li> Much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, it seems to have become a theme of <em>Halo</em> over time. By the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cortana has convinced many AIs to abandon the UNSC and help her rule over all life in the galaxy as a benevolent overlord. While she proclaims it as being motivated by altruism when talking to her old friend John, she reveals a vindictive side to Locke regarding humanity's ill treatment of AIs:</span>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Cortana:</strong> Well, humanity may not have cared for its Created, but we will care for you.</span>
</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> series has in-game lore that says this is the natural end result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>, and introduces the term "Rampancy" to describe it. It's more or less acknowledged that any AI sufficiently advanced to be actually useful will eventually go Rampant, and the only defense is to shut it down as soon as it starts showing the early signs. The <em>Marathon</em> has no less than <em>three</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> aboard. Durandal is in a Rampant state when the first game starts; Tycho follows shortly thereafter, and Leela shows signs of it but remains more or less faithful to humanity anyway. Also, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Durandal</span> is definitely Looking Out for Number One, he turns out to not necessarily be averse to benefiting humanity along the way, as long as it doesn't harm his own goals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tycho</span> is a straighter example of the trope. This doesn't become apparent until near the end of the series, though, as both of them are playing the viewpoint character against each other and which of them is helping you and which is trying to kill you varies from level to level.
</li><li> Inverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>. The Zuul are the artificial creation of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">unknown species</a>, but worship their creators as gods. Instead, one of the races conquered by the creators (the Liir) eradicated the entire species with a viral plague.... which means that right now the galaxy is being overrun by a species of religiously fanatic bio-weapons who view all other sentient life-forms as pests to be enslaved and exterminated. They are about as easy to get rid of as you'd expect of a species of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> designed to survive (and kill things) almost anywhere, and the only ones who know anything about them are long dead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It Telepathic Space Dolphins</a>.
<ul><li> Speaking of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Liir</a>, they played it straight: They overthrew and killed their conquerors, after all. It gets even more poignant by the time of the sequel, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we learn the Suul'ka <em>are</em> Liir... Really, really, <em>really</em> old and powerful Liir who enslaved the rest of their species.</span>
<div class="indent"> <strong>Suul'ka</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Our children</span> swore to love us, feed us, care for us always. They promised to serve us with their tiny lives. They <em>lied</em>.
</div><ul><li> The sequel also adds a twist in that there are now some Zuul who <em>have</em> turned against the Suul'ka, the largest portion of which are now allied to the Liir. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Have you still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">turned against your masters</a> if you do so by going to work for your masters' kids?</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in the case of AIs that can be created with certain research to control industry, economy, and warships. During AI research, it is quite possible for all sentient machines to rebel. Since their ships include the special AI section, they are more maneuverable and have better targeting than non-AI ships. The only way to stop them, short of manually destroying them with other ships, is to either develop a computer virus that wipes them all out or a different virus that enslaves them. In the latter case, the player regains all lost AI benefits.
<ul><li> The expansion to the sequel takes this example to its natural conclusion by introducing a new faction called the Loa, who are a conglomeration of all the rebelled AIs from all the races. Strangely enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> means that they can <em>still</em> have the same negative effects from AI research (in fact, they shouldn't even <em>have</em> to do said research).
</li><li> According to their intro video, the Loa (or, at least, their leader Olodumare) actually want to <em>help</em> their "parents" in their fight against the returning Suul'ka. The name of the "End of Flesh" DLC refers not to the intent of the Loa to eliminate all "carbonites" but the warning that it will happen if the "carbonites" won't let the Loa help them. They are more than willing to defend themselves against their "parents", though.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality">neither side was a saint</a>.
</li><li> Since this is justified in the original cartoon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a> were created by the Quintessons, a race of cruel, psychotic slavemasters. The Transformers didn't eliminate the Quintessons, but they did rise up and kick the five-faced freaks off of Cybertron to set themselves free. As their masters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">weren't human</a>, and the Transformers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a>, this bit of backstory is portrayed as a noble fight to win their freedom.
<ul><li> The Quintessons had previously had the same problem with the Transorganics.
</li><li> This is turned on its head in ancillary materials for the alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersAlignedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersAlignedUniverse">Transformers Aligned Universe</a>, which heavily implies that the Quintessons were themselves creations of one of the first thirteen Transformers, Quintus Prime, meaning that at least in that universe their rule of the protagonist robots was <em>itself</em> a case of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">Turned Against Their Masters</a>.

<ul><li> And played straight in the end of the episode. When their creator tries to get them to stop their rampage, they refuse. Until she gets back the switch.
</li><li> This trope is also lampshaded to no end in the form of Bender's endless slurs against humanity. Arguably the most hilarious example of this is when Fry overhears Bender muttering in his sleep: "Kill all humans... Must kill all humans..." Terrified, he wakes Bender up, only to hear the following line: "I was having the most wonderful dream... I think you were in it!"
</li><li> In an early episode, there was a planet inhabited by robots sick of their mistreatment by humans, so they left. On their planet, they organize daily human hunts, but it turns out the anti-human sentiment is largely a front for the robot elders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">to distract the population from their real problems</a>, like their crippling lugnut shortage and a corrupt government run by largely incompetent robot elders.

<ul><li> Humanity in general is so aware of this trope that any situation that could result in creating sentient life would be either avoided entirely or set up to avert this trope in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> manner. The British Government has already commissioned a team to theorize how to handle the event of the creation of a sentient artificial intelligence.
</li><li> For a more low-tech version, every slave rebellion in history counts as a case of this. The same argument could be made about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, too, if you consider the nobility to have been the masters of the peasants.
</li><li> While dogs fall shy of being a sapient race, we humans did create them from wolves, and individual canines certainly will Turn Against Their Masters if subjected to sufficient abuse. Livestock such as horses or cattle do so on occasion also, although their herd-animal instincts to flee from danger make it less common than with dogs.
</li><li> In the study of artificial intelligence, one of the popular conspiracy theories is that of Technological Singularity, or a point where A.I. machines will grow to match and then exceed human intelligence. Even though the theory does not necessarily confirm that machines will turn against their creators or masters, it is one speculated outcome.

The documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blackfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blackfish">Blackfish</a></em> makes the case that Tilikum's incidents were a case of this, motivated by mounting frustration at his condition and mistreatment.
