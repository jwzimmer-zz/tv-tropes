</div></div><p>The idea, especially in Fantasy settings, that older things generally are better. The swords left behind by an old civilization are better than those made by their modern descendants. Same goes for armor, magic, or whatever. Anything that can be described as "ancient" is better than its modern counterpart, as if people are regressing rather than inventing new technologies and improving on old ideas. In fact, this technology is so superior that it continues to outperform modern ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">despite spending a dozen centuries half buried in dirt in a cave</a>. This can be explained by a setting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>: if technology is not advancing, then older items made by legendary craftsmen will be better than modern gear made by run-of-the-mill craftsmen. Sometimes this can also be explained by the source of the items being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor">Precursor</a> race or Civilization, with the "modern" civilization having simply not caught up to them yet. Sometimes Science Fiction has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> after a dark age. In fantasy, it is often explained in the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge">magical beings and artifacts become more powerful with time</a>.

The romance of regaining superior wisdom of a bygone age has been a powerful driver behind this idea, even though there is much less truth in it than commonly thought. Especially in the late medieval age many areas of technology were ahead of anything the Romans ever did.

Modern science has surpassed the science of the ancients, meaning newly adopted technology has important advantages over older technologies. It does not have to be an improvement in all areas, but there is generally an overall improvement, which is why the technology could replace older versions. However, in pseudosciences like astrology and some alternative medicines (un-touched by the scientific method), the idea persists: these ancient knowledges and traditions have been around for so long, unchanged, so that must mean that they are better than modern science! It's the same logic as with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a>: if a tool has lasted for centuries and is still usable, then it must be damn good.

So far nothing modern comes close to the destructive potential that the Lost Logia exhibit. Also Ancient Belkan fighting arts have an equipment advantage in the Unison Devices and Cartridge Loads that are not found in the modern Mid-Childan system. While Mid-Childan devices can be adapted without much difficulty to use the Ancient Belkan cartridge system, no one has the slightest idea how to make Unison Devices anymore (the only new one in the modern era was created by... a sentient lost superweapon from Ancient Belka).

In a one-on-one battle, Grapearls are indeed faster, more agile, and better-equipped, to the point that even highly-advanced Ganmen like Enkidu get wrecked by them.

Centuries ago, Merlin enacted a worldwide magical interdict that prevents wizards from passing down their knowledge of powerful spells through anything but direct teaching from master to student. One cannot learn how to perform powerful spells from a book. Thus, the most potent spells have slowly been lost over time, as their masters die without successfully passing down their knowledge. This makes powerful magical artifacts created in centuries past better than anything capable of being created in the present.

Thanks to the horrendous attrition rate of the war, ships are no longer built to last. In Geary's time, ships would be built with the expected life of 50-100 years. Now, any ship that manages to survive 3 years is barely going to hold together, as quality control is virtually nonexistent. Additionally, everyone is sick and tired of the war, and wartime economy cannot be sustained indefinitely. Thus, cost-cutting is rampant, as evidenced by the new <em>Adroit</em>-class battlecrusers that are worse than the previous battlecruiser design in every way. Attrition is also so bad that tactical training for new officers is almost nonexistent; they're just told to charge straight in and hope they win.

If something is described as "Ancient", there is a 90% chance its better than its modern equivalent.

Alas, it's impossible to cast spells as powerful as Mavin's Worldweave or Proctiv's Seal Crystal Sphere (11 level). On the other hand? There's constant development — Netheril in his prime had nothing as efficient as Virus Charm or Sammaster's Spellcaster. Even magic items of relatively recent era of Myth Drannor are sometimes fabled and sometimes plain inferior (like protections <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverclockingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverclockingAttack">exploding on overload</a>).
<ul><li> Of course, Myth Drannor itself is "fabled" because humans ran in, got some of the old elven magical knowledge and began to <em>rapidly develop</em> on it, dragging elves along. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned">Just as Planned</a>, since the Coronal made this unpopular decision after observing a few Mage Fairs and coming to the conclusion that though he and a handful of others are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchForManToHandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchForManToHandle">more powerful</a>, he wants the best human wizards to work with his folk, if and while possible.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a> breathes this trope: With many subsequent collapsing civilization, you can tell how powerful something is by how old the civilization that invented it is, going from modern to ancient: Modern Day &lt; Dhakaani Empire &lt; Giant Empire &lt; Dragon / Demon War &lt; Progenitor Dragons.
<ul><li> Oddly in other ways, Eberron averts the trope - new advances are constantly made - with several organizations such as guilds, universities and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Dragonmarked Houses</a> constantly doing R&amp;D and rolling out new advances. The last 100 year of war in particular saw a gigantic advance in technology and magic. Generally the trope is averted within a given era, but played straight between eras. Justified in that giants were more powerful as a species than the humanoids and goblinoids that followed them, while the dragons and demons eclipsed even the giants. The Dhakaani goblinoids meanwhile had several thousand years of prosperity to innovate, while the modern human-dominated kingdom is still in its first millenia of existence.

Many of the equipment from the days of the Star League were well advanced for their time and were simply much better than the newer, watered-down equivalents of the much later eras to the point that any such equipment (Star League-era, of course) is highly coveted upon. Alas, with the Star League folded, the technology has been all but reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">lost relics</a> since most of the galaxy's technological and industrial bases ended up getting smashed during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">300 years of civil war</a>, losing them the ability to produce their highly advanced technology. Thus, newer mechs tend to be less capable in combat when paired up against similar mechs that were built hundreds of years earlier. Of course, if you HAVE such an old (but powerful) mech, you try to make sure it gets the best of maintenance so it will continue to be the best.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot">However, over the decades</a> lost technology was recovered and relatively low-level warfare allowed the nations to rebuild; the late 3030s or 3040 often considered a tipping point where new mechs like the <em>Hauptmann</em> and <em>Uriel</em> are at least equal to their Star League predecessors, though it took over a decade for the revived tech to truly propagate. The Clans, who were unaffected by the Succession Wars, field mechs that are <em>vastly</em> superior to equipment from <em>any</em> era in the Inner Sphere.
</li></ul></li><li> Obviously very prominent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> - not only They Don't Make Them Like They Used To - ancient magic weapons and eldar artifacts benefit from 'ancientness' as much as human technology.
<ul><li> Human technology is locked in stasis due to technology <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">becoming a religion</a> and 'discovery' effectively becoming archaeology - the only way an innovation will ever be approved by the high priests of the tech-cult is if it can be shown to have been an original part, or intended optional extra, of the base design.
<ul><li> Human civilization was also more powerful than the Imperium of Man is presently, at one point. Their leftover weapons are some of the most powerful tools the Imperium has at its disposal to this day, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">skyscraper-tall Emperor-class titans</a>, surface-to-space anti-spaceship defense lasers, and giant experimental mobile weapons platforms.
</li><li> Additionally, there are some background texts in Forge World supplements that suggest the pan-galactic human civilization which preceded the Imperium of Man used the Baneblade tank designs which the Imperium calls "super-heavy battle tanks" as "light combat tanks," which should put in perspective just how physically large and powerful a true human-made super-heavy battle tank would be, if the aforementioned machine cult could ever find the designs.
</li><li> One of the ultimate examples of this trope in the game is the fact that the Heavy Stubber, a capable and reliable heavy weapon often found gracing Imperial vehicles and emplacements and churned out of Forge Worlds by the millions out of their simplicity, ease of use and ability to pump out reasonably powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>, is the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_Browning">Browning M2<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A gun first designed in <em>1918</em> still finds use <em>dozens of millennia later</em>. Older Is Better indeed.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> technology is similarly unable to improve a lot because they are, as a species, essentially all refugees and mostly unable to sustain their population, never mind their technological infrastructure. They do innovate though, but not often and only in terms of re-applying existing knowledge and not making new discoveries.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless">The Necrons</a>...basically <em>are</em> an Ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor">Precursor</a> race, only made into immortal, self-repairing robots and locked in stasis for 65Myr. They haven't improved their technology because it's already vastly superior to everyone else's and they are now unthinking automatons, for the most part.
</li><li> Chaos avert this in that they are constantly coming up with new stuff or, rather, are prepared to let their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">gods</a> change their old stuff in unpredictable ways (that usually involve lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfVillainy">spikes</a> as well) for them.
</li><li> Dark Eldar avert this as well. Originally they used psychic technology and sorcery as much as their more mainstream cousins. But after the Fall, the Dark Eldar had to almost completely abandon all their ancient tech and re-invent much of it from the ground up using more mundane methods. But because they have a stable population and sufficient resources and infrastructure, they're able to support a researcher caste who've actually been creating new technology and not just updating old ones. In fact, some of their newer tech is so advanced as to be almost magical and the Dark Eldar actively go out to experiment and invent when they're not too busy going around torturing and enslaving.
</li><li> The Tau, on the other hand, avert this entirely; as the naive upstart race they are constantly updating and upgrading their technology, seeking alliances with other species and generally acting entirely counter to the tone of the setting...unless you are foolish enough to get in their way.
</li><li> Also averted with da Orks. Most of their weapons technology lags well behind that of the other races of course, but they're astonishingly resourceful, constantly inventing ever crazier designs and incorporating other race's technology into their own, at times looting enemy vehicles and weaponry and "making it Orky". They cribbed teleporters and tractor beams off the Imperium only a few centuries ago and now, much to the Techpriest's chagrin, they can build them better than humanity can. Some reports from out of the Eastern Fringe imply they're even starting to get the hang of Tau technology.

Magic, monsters, heroes and spirits used to be greater in the old glory days. The game which relies on this trope most might be the Vampire games. Vampires being pretty much immortal have a lot of elders still alive and they benefit both from growing more powerful with age and from being just inherently more awesome because they were made in the olden days by vampires related closer to the first vampire. The supposed end of the world that may not be far off is predicted to be caused by the rise of all the most ancient and powerful vampires who are believed to be asleep.
</li><li> The standard setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> is assumed to be the Second Age of Creation. Most of the best technology comes from the First Age. This is because the Solars, the most powerful of the Exalted, ruled Creation during the first age, and used their superhuman skills to create advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> wonders. After the weaker Dragon-Blooded killed the Solars and took control of Creation, they simply weren't able to keep up the kind of standards the Solars could. Because of the way reincarnation works in Exalted, a surprising number of young Solars get their best gear by raiding their own tombs, and many Second Age states, most notably the powerful city-state of Lookshy, have risen to power in whole or in part on how much First Age technology they've managed to scavenge and/or preserve.
</li><li> Appears to be the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em>, with a lot of high tech and/or magic left over in the remains of previous civilisations that can't be replicated, or often even understood, by people in the current time. However, it's somewhat subverted since there's no inherent reason for old things to be better, it's simply that civilisation has gone through several cycles of rise and fall, and the current one simply hasn't yet reached the heights of previous ones.

The Dwemer were said to alter the "Earth Bones," which were the parts of the Aedra that were used to create and define the laws of the world, in order to create their technologies, which have since been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">lost</a> in the millennia since their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">mysterious disappearance</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>'s crafting system <em>does</em> allow for the "forging" and improving upon Dwemer gear using Dwemer metal, but it's implied that you're just melting down the already Ragnarok-Proofed metal and using it, not replicating exactly what the Dwemer did to create it initially.

It's a middle-tier light armor and weapon set, with only armors made of specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyMetals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyMetals">rarer material</a>, such as Glass, Ebony or Daedric Ebony, being better.

The Ancient Nord weapons that you find lying around in Nord burial mounds are weaker, heavier, and less valuable than even modern steel weapons. However, it is implied that weakness of the ancient Nord weapons and armor is because of decay from old age. If you complete the Companions' quest line, you gain access to techniques for reforging the ancient Nord weapons into brand spanking new (but otherwise identical) "Nord Hero" weapons and upgrading the ancient Nord armor, which makes them a viable late-game choice for equipment.

That said, this is justified as most of said equipment comes from the Third Age...which is also known as the God Wars. Since then, there not only hasn't been a global war that lasted <strong>five thousand years</strong> (in fact, both the Fourth and Fifth Ages combined were millennia shorter than that), but godly influence has been removed when the war was forcibly ended as a draw, meaning no new materials could be blessed by divine power until the Sixth Age.

For the most part, a lot of great gear can be found in the Atlantis equivalent era, which is in the future of 65,000,000 BC but the past relative to you, and some of the best gear can be made in the present once you acquire the appropriate materials, suggesting it's less that Older Is Better and more the past had better resources available.
</li><li> Top-tier equipment (not just unique artifacts and relics) in the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> setting (in particular on Enroth) tends towards the old, generally for one of three reasons: it was made with the help of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Heavenly Forge</a> or otherwise by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor">Ancient</a> technology, it is so costly and complicated to make that most examples in existence are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon">Ancestral</a>, or it is made from materials <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">no longer available, or at least very, very rare</a>. Notably, however, it is made clear that technology and magic <em>is</em> being developed as the years pass, it's just that the above factors skews the perspective for the absolute top-tier equipment (and indeed there are a few cases of top-tier gear that are actually <em>new</em>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ShoresOfHazeron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ShoresOfHazeron">Shores of Hazeron</a></em>, a 4X indie MMO, the galaxy was effectively ruled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Toucans</a>, a vast player-owned and populated empire, whose ships were beautifully designed and ridiculously powerful - they were one of the few empires with the resources to field <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">Tech level 32</a> ships. When the Toucans collectively left, their ships became <em>very</em> valuable - players would plunder their abandoned planets and spacedocks to try and claim the ships and recover their design discs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, the Prothean Particle Rifle will continuously fire until it overheats, at which point one has to wait until it cools down to fire, just like the guns in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">first</a></em> game. It seems the Protheans never thought of, (or disliked), using disposable heat-sinks as ammo. It was explicitly stated to be a design chosen due to logistic problems.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a>, one of the items you can find is an elvish sword "of great antiquity." Why does it glow when enemies are near, and still cut like the best blade you can find today? Because it's <em>of great antiquity</em>, that's why!
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series comes pretty close to realism on this issue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the nuclear war that almost wiped out civilization</a>, pre-War technology (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon">plasma rifles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">power armor</a>, and so forth) is highly sought-after and usually much better than what you'll find in the hands of raiders and psychos. But it's not the technology that's been lost so much as the means to produce ithard to make power armor when you don't have access to anything more sophisticated than a hammer. When factions get large enough and powerful enough to build <em>new</em> technology, it's usually on par with the pre-War stuff.
<ul><li> <em>Usually</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTactics">Fallout Tactics</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> shows that the Brotherhood of Steel have the means to construct airships despite the state of post-War America but still rely on pre-War vehicles. The Institute of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> zigzag this: they can and have made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceptivelyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceptivelyHumanRobots">robots</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">synthetic humans</a> that can pass off as normal people and even <em>synthetic gorillas</em> but the problem is that the robots are often more dim than pre-War robots and the laser pistols and rifles they are given are actually bigger and fire weaker shots than pre-War laser weapons, like those used by the Brotherhood of Steel.

The <em>Astrid</em> turns out to be large enough to evacuate much of the remaining population of Morningstar Prime, and her shields are strong enough to withstand the combined firepower of the Terran fleet for hours. One wonders what the ship could have done, if her weapons were still functional. It seems the outer colonies were not the only ones who underwent technological regression of those centuries.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Visual Novels </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a>, all things magical run on this principle. Servants from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> gain strength with age and fame. Gilgamesh, being the oldest Heroic Spirit, uses this to compensate for being up against more famous Heroic spirits in both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fourth Grail War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">the Fifth Grail War</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Not that he'd need it</a>.
<ul><li> The boost his opponents get from being more popular, as Rin explains, is actually pretty insignificant<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1f1of');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1f1of" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1f1of');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That boost would be far more significant in the actual location where a Servant's legend originated. For example, Lancer (Cú Chulainn) would be at his strongest in Ireland, Rider (Medusa), Caster (Medea) and Berserker (Heracles) would all be strongest in Greece and Saber (King Arthur) would be strongest in England and Wales...though the latter two are so universally renowned that they'd get some degree of power boost anywhere on Earth. But since the Holy Grail War takes place in Japan and none of the Servants in either the Fourth or Fifth Grail War were Japanese (aside from the "fake Servant" Assassin (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SasakiKojiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SasakiKojiro">Sasaki Kojiro</a>), this didn't really come into play.</span>, whereas being 1500 years older than any other spirit in the war is a gigantic boost to his power.
</li><li> This also applies to Noble Phantasms which are based on a Plato's Idea of Form. In general, the older a Phantasm, and thus closer it is to the original conception. As a result an older Phantasm will defeat any similar Phantasm born from a newer iteration of the legend (e.g Gram, the Sword pulled from the Tree, of Norse Mythology is superior to Caliburn, the Sword in the Stone, of Arthurian lore). Gilgamesh possesses "prototypes"(Perfect Form) of all later Noble Phantasms, each one significantly stronger than its more well-known derivatives, with only a few exceptions.
</li><li> This is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a> rule of magic in general. Creatures and magical artifacts also get stronger with age. A sufficiently aged magic sword can tear apart a modern mage's barrier simply by being drawn. A creature from the Age of the Gods, is so powerful they are consider on par with the Five True Magics.
</li><li> Subverted by Archer. He's technically the newest Heroic Spirit <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since he's from the future</span>. While he's pretty weak stat-wise and would lose to the likes of Lancer or Saber in a straight-up physical confrontation, he's also arguably the most powerful Servant summoned in the Grail War <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since his "Noble Phantasm" is actually the ability to reproduce copies of various weapons he's seen throughout his life, including weapon-type Noble Phantasms with few exceptions. The nature of his powers also makes him the perfect counter to Gilgamesh.</span>
</li><li> Magic itself also follows this rule. Servant Caster, who lived in the Age of Gods <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">(Ancient Greece)</a>, can use very powerful spells using few (and sometimes only one) word, while modern magic users need one minute to conjure magic of such power, it's no wonder that her "High-Speed Divine Words" skill is at A level. Even the exceptionally rare True Magic (which cannot be learned and only randomly crops up as the inherent trait of some lucky magus) can't compare to magic from the Age of Gods, as it tends to be extremely specialized whereas Caster can use her ancient magic for basically anything she pleases.

As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">technology has marched on</a>, one of the most significant differences has been the change from human labor being cheap and materials being expensive to materials being cheap and human labor being expensive. When metal, fabrics and polymers were just this side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Unobtainium</a> the consumer would not only want something that could last, but also something that could be easily repaired. When labourers were literally a dime a dozen and worked 18 hour shifts it was simple to provide all those little things that would ensure good quality. Today, technology has allowed materials like aluminum and plastics to replace (possibly) more durable wood and steel and replaced hand craftsmanship with cheap mass fabrication.
<ul><li> Is most often averted where new materials have allowed for massive increases in reliability or strength like solid state electronics or anything that goes into an automotive drivetrain.
</li><li> Weapons, in particular, have changed over the years; prior to the late 1800s, handguns were 'hand-crafted', as it were, by well-practiced and highly-skilled gunsmiths. The major downside was that a gunslinger couldn't visit just any gunsmith to repair a broken weapon; the hand-manufactured parts were specific to the particular weapon being repaired, and wouldn't fit in another gun (often, they wouldn't even fit into a new gun made by the <em>same</em> gunsmith).
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons for the prevalence of this trope is the appearance of the "throw away culture" where new products are built with lesser durability or with a set "shelf life" in comparison to their older counterparts to stimulate consumption. This becomes a greater problem for the people of countries that are not from the First World for whom buying a car or a fridge is already a costly investment and would prefer reliability over novelty.
<ul><li> To elaborate, planned obsolescence is an idea that caught on (in the United States) in the thirties through fifties. The idea came about after several companies in the roaring twenties went belly up in the thirties (helping cause the depression) because their own reliable products killed any possibility of repeat business. Manufactures then wizened up and decided they didn't need to make products that last forever, only until they become unfashionable (which to be fair also made them affordable to more people). Thus its not rare to find some refrigerators from the early fifties still happily ticking away after decades of minimal maintenance while seeing fridges from the nineties doing the same is comparatively rare. However it should be noted this is starting to be subverted as the proliferation of used car dealerships and sites like e-bay assisting second hand sales has created a market for new reliable machines. Some manufacturers are starting to catch on, and have begun marketing their products on the basis that the buyer could recap a significant portion of their investment selling the product secondhand.
</li></ul></li><li> While normally it's expected for products to generally incrementally improve, sometimes the opposite happens. Though economic circumstances, the desire for greater returns, incompetence in management, internal drama, or low motivation can result in a product with substantially lower quality or quality assurance.
</li><li> Wine and spirits improve with age, at least according to the connoisseurs who drink them. However, after enough time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">they become undrinkable</a>. Wine will decay into vinegar (literally "sour wine").
</li><li> One of the advantages that the old, mechanical cars have over their automatic counterparts is that the former can be started up even when the battery is without power by pushing the car and starting the engine while the car is in movement, something that can't be done in the latter due to its greater reliance on the battery.
</li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/01/02/144482863/double-blind-violin-test-can-you-pick-the-strad">many musicians<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the sound produced by cord instruments takes on a noticeably different timbre if they were constructed a very long time ago. The aging of the wood changes the dampening profile of the resonating chamber. This is one reason Stradivarius violins are so sought-after: Not only was Antonio Stradivari a highly skilled craftsman, but his violins are now over three centuries old. Additionally, it is thought that Stradivari's primary source of material for his more famous violins may have been cold-preserved wood from ruins that were already at least hundreds of years old, making this a real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Exaggerated Trope</a>.
<ul><li> Analysis of Stradivarius violins' output has shown that the modern violins that most closely match the wave form and envelope of those ancient instruments are mass-produced student models. Modern artisan violins, held to be the finest currently produced, have very different outputs.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thestrad.com/cpt-latests/blind-tested-soloists-unable-to-tell-stradivarius-violins-from-modern-instruments/">double blind test<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> revealed that the Stradivarius violins are not quite as superior to modern top-drawer violins.
</li></ul></li><li> Newer technology often depends on certain assumptions and can be ineffective or even useless outside of that context. This can result in having "obsolete" technology used in places where new technology fares poorly or kept around as a backup. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">Rock Beats Laser</a>.
<ul><li> The US military phased out pack animals in the 1950s, only to be reminded that wheels are poorly suited to the rugged terrain found in areas of Afghanistan. In 2004, the US Army printed <em>Special Forces Use of Pack Animals</em>, which "captures some of the expertise and techniques that have been lost...over the last 50 years."
<ul><li> The same happened back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WWII</a>. Cavalry were among the Soviet troops who gave the Germans the most trouble in the early stages after control and logistics were lost. In the short term, they needed only machine gun / rifle ammo and food, and horses are good for bad terrain and can graze with zero logistical consideration in lush terrain. In comparison, Soviet <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wwiivehicles.com/ussr/tanks-heavy/kv-2.asp">heavy tanks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were by far the most powerful of their time, but without directions and supply, got reduced to lonely light fortifications holding a tiny spot until they ran out of shells — at best.
</li></ul></li><li> Single engine propeller-driven ground attack/fighters are making a comeback, even with the United States Air Force. Although slower and lower-flying than jets, the prop planes have much more loiter capability, allowing them to hang around an area for hours and making them useful in dealing with insurgents or drug producers/smugglers. And a slower aircraft is easier to fire from accurately if your opponent has lacking ability to fire back at the easier target.
</li><li> This is why spacecraft always use laughably outdated computer hardware and software for mission-critical systems. Familiarity and reliability become far more important than raw power when a computer is thousands or millions of miles away from the nearest technical support or where any kind of servicing would be completely impossible as on automated probes.
</li><li> During the Crimean takeover, Russian army forces switched almost entirely to using messengers instead of radio for communication. This got Western intelligences completely fooled and taken by surprise, as they saw no increase in radio activity just before the invasion.
</li></ul></li><li> Some guitarists still prefer tube amplifiers over transistor amplifiers because of the (supposedly) warmer and more organic output of the tube amp.
<ul><li> This extends to audiophile equipment in general, solid-state and vacuum tube alike; a vintage amp or integrated receiver from the 1970s is generally considered better than most of the cost-reduced equipment from the 1980s and later, often with fully-discrete components as opposed to integrated circuits, and perfectly smooth, damped volume and tuner knobs. The particularly expensive stuff like McIntosh gear even held its value remarkably well over the decades, especially if serviced for components that tend to drift out of spec over time, such as electrolytic capacitors.
<ul><li> Ultimately a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig Zagged Trope</a> in terms of peak audio performance; you can get equipment today that sonically blows away vintage equivalents, especially speakers, from a sheer fidelity standpoint, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">Crack Is Cheaper</a> compared to just buying top-of-the-line equipment from the 1970s, even if the increasing awareness of vintage audio value has driven prices up for systems made in that period, particularly by brands like Marantz, Pioneer and Sansui.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The vinyl LP record is still preferred over Compact Discs and other digital musical formats by connoisseurs, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudnessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudnessWar">Loudness War</a> carries equal blame.
</li><li> Hardware synthesizers, especially analog ones, are often perceived as superior to software; analog equipment, in particular, is often described as having sound that is described with measures like "warm", "fat", "organic", "full", and other wizardry which no original synth designer have ever thought about. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">Rule of Perception</a>, applied to analog synthesizers with a lot of knobs to turn and to shape sound in real time, leads to some people outright refusing to believe that the modern top-tier analog modeling software synthesizers like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_CKqEPxLgc">Diva<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, controlled by a good MIDI controller with any amount of knobs imaginable, are able to easily surpass their instruments, especially if they paid good money for them - vintage analog synthesizers can be extremely expensive.
<ul><li> Digital synthesizers are also a good example of this trope: originally, in the 70-80's, when digital synthesis was invented, it was presented as a more precise and clean alternative to analog. Then the flaws of early digital synthesizers were found, namely, too sterile sound with less character than analog. Nowadays, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>, and digital synthesis is able not to imitate analog synthesizers - ranging from cheap-sounding knockoffs to the sound that is even better than hardware - but also to improve the quality of digital synthesis as a whole, inventing new synthesizers (or improving the old ones) and pushing their possibilities to the skies with post-production and more resources to spend. Yet, by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>, some people tend not to notice this, complaining that digital synthesis is still all the same, like it's never been researched further, and by the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">Rule of Perception</a>, some people are still obsessed by the low-bitrate vintage digital synthesizers or new hardware models like Waldorf Blofeld.
</li></ul></li><li> Cathode Ray Tube displays may be bulky, heavy, incredibly power-inefficient and require some analog tweaking to get right, but they also do not have the viewing angle issues modern Liquid Crystal Displays do, as well as much deeper black levels (and improved static contrast as a result), much lower image persistence due to their strobing nature, practically zero input lag, higher refresh rates than the typical 60 Hz flat-panel (with the best examples topping out at 160 to 180 Hz at lower resolutions!), and unlike any other display technology, they do not have native resolutions or strictly square pixels. This makes the humble old CRT the ideal choice for any retro computer or gaming console made with its properties in mind.
<ul><li> Consider that a Sony GDM-FW900 monitor is still considered one of the best PC gaming monitors in existence even a decade and a half after its production, with people still willing to pay top dollar for a working one because it's also one of the few instances of a <em>widescreen</em> CRT monitor with the performance of a professional graphics display. Aside from space, power consumption, and the missing VGA output on modern graphics cards making it difficult to extract the most out of its performance (driving 1920x1200 at 95 Hz requires a fast RAMDAC beyond what a typical DisplayPort or HDMI to VGA adapter can offer), it is the closest to a "no compromise" display that one could ask for.
</li><li> Also consider that for the above-stated reasons, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em> community insists on CRT displays for playing at a competitive level. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGameCommunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGameCommunity">Fighting Game Community</a> in general is more tolerant of modern flat-panel displays so long as the input lag is below 16ms (under one frame at a 60 Hz refresh rate), but some will still favor a CRT if given the choice.
</li></ul></li><li> Many photographers never use the full automatic mode when transitioning from film camera to digital. They achieve better results on manual mode<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2txhs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2txhs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2txhs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or at least semi-manual modes such as shutter-priority or aperture-priority, or using program mode but in all cases leaving some parameters such as ISO speed to be selectable, depending of what is allowed or not by the camera.</span> - they are used to it and can use it to obtain best results. They also favor their extant old lenses, which are usually metal, glass and built to last, over more modern all-plastic lenses, which are lighter but less robust.
<ul><li> Full automatics usually are set to "discernible in most possible cases" which by definition is suboptimal for specific cases, so even an operator with small experience can do better. People who worked with a film camera tend to at least understand what aperture, shutter and focal depth <em>do</em>, even if the sensor is not the same. While people who come from cellphone cams / webcams and other "soapboxes" with pinprick aperture didn't see the differences obvious with any halfway good lenses and usually need a lot of experiments to "feel" the optics.
</li><li> Vintage lenses are usually so well-built, and yet so affordable second-hand that it's not unheard for people to adapt them to modern digital camera bodies. This does require giving up the convenience of auto-focus, as that did not become commonplace until the late 1980s, but they can still hold their own in terms of optical quality. Manual-focus lenses also tend to have much better-built adjustment rings, with solid detents for aperture adjustment and focus rings that are smooth, damped, and easy to dial in just right.
</li></ul></li><li> People will often hold on to antiques for this very reason. Some feel that antiques are better made (older cars or refrigerators with all metal parts are more durable than modern plastic), look better (houses are built with brick or wooden logs to give it a more "rustic" feel), or more versatile (an old wind-up alarm clock or typewriter won't cause as much of a headache during a power outage.)
<ul><li> The quality or durability idea is in many cases completely mythical. As materials and precise manufacturing improve, something doing the same job may be able to keep doing it much longer with less maintenance. It wasn't until the 1980s that cars gained a 6th digit on their odometers because that was when they started regularly lasting past 100 000km/mi.
</li><li> In other cases it may be perfectly justified. As an example, fully functional refrigerators from the 50's and 40's are still widely available due to what may be superior construction vs modern designs. While they may be less energy-efficient than the modern competition, it can be argued that the extra electricity costs are more than offset by not having to replace expensive parts (or entire units) on a regular basis.
<ul><li> The latter is one of the prime reasons for new models: governments requiring more energy efficiency for environmental reasons. Cars especially have constantly increasing mileage targets to meet with the amount of energy in a gallon of gasoline remaining the same. So cars have to get smaller and lighter (while still maintaining crash standards), requiring the use of less metal and rubber and more plastic parts.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope actually held perfectly true for any number of things for a period directly after the fall of the Roman Empire. A quick study of Medieval architecture will show that Medieval builders had a preference for building on the foundations of or simply modifying old Roman buildings because Roman engineering was simply better. Part of this was a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that was mostly forgotten until the 14th century: concrete.
</li><li> Modernist architecture is universally considered to be inferior to that of the past centuries because of practical problems the Modernist buildings tend to have: Modernist buildings often suffer from sick building syndrome, excessive molding, poor ventilation, mildew issues, water seeping in, heating issues, and also Modernist buildings tend to weather easily, because of "revolutionary" construction techniques and features like flat roofs with no eaves combined with cost-cutting. Especially Le Corbusier buildings tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>. In Germany, <em>Altbauten</em> (pre-WWII buildings) are favoured over <em>Neubauten</em> (post-WWII buildings). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a> applies to the band name Einstürzende Neubauten.
<ul><li> Although taste is subjective, many think modern architecture and decor are cosmetically inferior to more traditional forms. A common critique is that modern decor does not blend well with non-modern elements or messes, so you will have to buy all modern furniture and always keep a tidy home. And, to many, the result is a cold, hard-edged, emotionless pile of contemptible trendiness. This is perhaps most notorious when you compare the amount of details and variations in the designs used for public buildings or monumental structures in the early years of the past century in comparison with the more simpler types of buildings of today.
</li><li> Prior to the proliferation of computers in the late fifties and sixties, it was considerably cheaper to over engineer projects than it was to hire someone to do advanced calculations to save building material. As a result many older structures are ridiculously strong by modern standards. An often cited example is the comparison between Hoover Dam and the Three Gorges Dam. The Hoover Dam was built in the 30s without access to computers or the same technology as the later and used a more complicated design. It hasn't cracked yet. The Three Gorges Dam however was engineered to be built quickly and use as little concrete as was needed. As was expected it formed, several non-critical cracks even though its just a long pile of cement.
</li></ul></li><li> Older appliances tended to follow a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> mindset while newer top of the line ones are something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillgateCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillgateCharacter">Skillgate Character</a>. Your grandparents drier operated on one motor controlled by a completely analog dials. It takes a lot of trial, error, and practice but they would have learned how to use it and gotten consistent results from it and expected it to last a life time. The drier however has several servos thrown in to articulate the drum, thermometers, multiple scales to detect weight distribution, humidity sensors, and a digital computer to control everything. It can deal with whatever mess you haphazardly throw in it pretty well, but after a year or so something has probably started to fail and you won't get as good results when you try to learn what all those fancy settings actually do. While most users accept the convenience the modern option offers, there is a reason older generations can legitimately say theirs was better.
</li><li> Wood quality often works this way for many reasons. Primarily, it is because the older a tree is, the harder its wood usually is; olive trees, for example, can grow rather quickly under the right conditions, but the wood takes quite a bit longer to become usable. The second part of this is that, in modern times, tree farming has become a popular alternative to conventional logging. Trees grown this way are of species that grow quickly in nature, which is accelerated even more at a farm; this growth rate makes the wood fairly soft. Lastly, a lot of the best quality trees for wood have gone extinct or become prohibitively rare, or are protected. For example, it used to be common to use chestnut wood for everything in the US because it was plentiful, strong, and cosmetically appealing, however invasive beetles have now nearly obliterated American chestnut forests.
</li><li> Hand tools for wood work such as axes, hand saws, chisels, hand drills, bar clamps, and bench planes tend to be of higher quality if they were made in the late 19th or early 20th century. These used to be marketed to professionals who were making huge numbers of houses, cabinets, and pieces of furniture, and they were willing to pay good prices for their tools to be sharp, accurate, easily adjustable, and durable. Then came the rising tide of electric drills, table saws, band saws, jointers, thickness planers, routers, etc. which greatly reduced demand for hand tools in the trades because they made work so much faster. A lot of companies went out of business, while a few giants like Stanley and Irwin decided to cut costs in order to stay in business, trading on their brand reputation from the past to sell hobbyists inferior versions of their old products. The role of thumb is that you shouldnt buy a vintage hand plane made after the 1950s. Since then weve seen something of a hand tool renaissance, and modern companies like Lie-Nielsen and Veritas make new premium models that are in many ways even better than the originals thanks to modern steel and machining, but they are quite expensive and dont have the same historical appeal. On one hand, people getting into the hobby will often be advised to hunt for deals on "fixer upper" antique tools that would work very well is restored, and on the other hand youve got the collectors (mainly of planes) who will pay huge sums for rare antique models in good condition.
</li><li> Frequently encountered in software. There can be numerous reasons behind this - <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">featuritis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> could render a more recent version impractical compared to an earlier one that was deft and focused in its design, or perhaps the developers behind the original software moved on and the quality of future versions suffered as a result of their design philosophies clashing with that of new staff in charge of a project, or a drastic change in design direction makes transferring to a new version more of a hassle than it's worth, sometimes newest versions actually cut useful features because of perceived unpopularity...
<ul><li> For a well-known example, remember how many people stuck with XP when Vista was released, due to the latter's notoriously slow technical performance and Useful Useless<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3cbpp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3cbpp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3cbpp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">until they were improved in Windows 7, at least.</span> Aero features. This repeated with the release of Windows 8.
</li><li> There are communities known for a devoted preference to the Classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> OS as opposed to the more modern, NeXTSTEP-derived Mac OS X/macOS, particularly those in need of a Digital Audio Workstation without the distractions and potential sources of latency that a preemptive multi-tasking OS would bring. It's for this exact reason that a late-model Quicksilver or Mirrored Drive Doors Power Mac G4 holds its value a lot better than the later Power Mac G5 - aside from the G5s being infamously prone to failure over the years, often a result of being ill-suited to dispersing the heat output of the PowerPC 970 G5, they cannot run the Classic Mac OS natively, and the Classic mode in OS X up through 10.4 Tiger (10.5 Leopard removed it) is not an adequate substitute.
</li><li> An even more extreme case that blends into hardware choice is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommodoreAmiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommodoreAmiga">Commodore Amiga</a> user base, as they often equip their vintage Commodore-era Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards, or sometimes pick out specific PowerPC boards (Macs need not apply), just for the sole purpose of running AmigaOS 4.1 as opposed to switching over to Windows, macOS or Linux like the rest of the world.
</li></ul></li><li> Retrofuturists and followers of the Raygun Gothic Styles. They prefer older depictions of the future for the campy character over comparatively dull and clinical modern technical visions.
</li><li> When the M16 assault rifle was introduced during the Vietnam War, many soldiers preferred to use the older M14 battle rifle. While the M16's lighter direct-impingment gas system required more frequent cleaning than the gas-piston in the M14 some severe admin errors caused A) it using the wrong propellant <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note489ih');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note489ih" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note489ih');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the propellant the gas system was designed for was not the one the US military had selected and the conversion was forgotten about </span> causing even more fouling and B) the inexplicable myth of being self-cleaning, so no cleaning kits were issued. Combine those and humid, muddy jungle conditions, you have a very unreliable weapon. These teething problems where rectified and the system further improved in subsequent versions, with the M16A1 being a significant improvement as the war progressed and the M16A4 serving as the Marine Corps' service rifle until 2015.
<ul><li> This occurred again when the Beretta 92F (as M9) replaced the M1911A1 as the standard side arm of the US military. Early Berettas suffered from a slide failure that could injure the shooter and damage the pistol (this was rectified in subsequent models with the 92FS). When the gun was taken into combat for Iraq and Afghanistan, there were was significant dissatisfaction about it's stopping power. In 2015 the US Army officially rejected continuation of the Beretta, and is now on course for another sidearm, eventually finding it in the 9x19mm SIG P320. In the spirit of this trope, there's talk of bringing back the M1911A1 using modern materials.
</li><li> The M16 and the Beretta aren't the only firearms to fall afoul of this trope:
<ul><li> The German G36 has a serious problem with overheating (the rifle's plastic shell is reputed to become severely warped from firing two full magazines back-to-back in full-auto). By contrast, the battle rifle it replaced, the all-metal G3, didn't. Because of that, some German soldiers prefer their older G3s over the G36. Though the problem was eventually fixed, politicians naturally insisted on replacing the rifle.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Soviet-Afghan a lot of Soviet troops complained that their newer AK-74 wasn't as good as the older model, the infamous AKM (popularly known as the AK-47). However testing proved that this was mostly due to a "grass is greener" mindset. The 74 is more accurate, easier to use, and lighter. A soldier simply remembers every time his gun jams in combat and rarely notices when an enemy's does.
</li></ul></li><li> In the civilian gun industry, a lot of countries have what's called the grandfather clause, where gun control legislation doesn't apply to any gun first sold before the legislation was enacted. This means a lot of older guns in circulation have nifty little features that can't be sold on modern guns.
</li><li> Nuclear reactors still almost exclusively use analog controls and instruments, and the few that do use any digital systems always have analog back ups. Analog controls work without power and can't be hacked.
</li><li> Harley-Davidson products are often derided as being technologically behind, though in truth the technology has developed frequently; the bike on the showroom floor today is not (depending on circumstances) the same bike your grandfather rode during the Second World War, which in turn was not the same bike that first sputtered to life in 1903. You may like new Japanese or European motorcycles for their modern appearance, but there is a reason there is no such culture built up around Honda as there is around Harley-Davidson. Many prefer older engines or models, convinced of their superiority despite all evidence to the contrary. One female rider was constantly harassed by her younger brother over her choice to ride a modern Harley powered by an Evo engine, while he still rode a Shovelhead-powered bike. One day she brought another Evo rider home, who averted the trope by stopping the tirade with a tale of how he had had to tow the Shovel-riding brother home with his Evo, after the Shovelhead had broken down...
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures">Sony Pictures</a> hack in 2014, the studio started <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thewrap.com/panicked-hollywood-avoids-email-returns-to-faxes-after-sony-hack-attack-this-is-really-a-nightmare/">switching back to fax machines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for communications, as these were far more secure than email systems that could be hacked into.
</li><li> Strangely enough, this is true for the Wright brothers' prototype plane. The original version of their plane worked fine and the flight times could be improved with enough practice. On one of the anniversaries of the first flight, a replica was made of the plane and turned out to be completely unable to take to the sky. No one is quite sure why, but it probably means that the brothers left some important bit out of the blueprints.
