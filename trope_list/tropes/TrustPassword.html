<ul><li> In <em>Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody</em>, Kyon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gives Yuki the piece of paper that she gives him in three years' time as he travels through time himself</span>. This convinces her to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">synchronize her memories with her future self, effectively merging her current and future selves into the same person</span>. And then she returns the favor immediately afterward, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking off her glasses the same way she does three years later</span>.
</li><li> In the fourth light novel, Kyon finds himself in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> where the SOS members are ordinary humans. Haruhi won't even give him the time of day, until in desperation, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">introduces himself as John Smith, the alias he used as a time traveler helping him out three years ago</span>. After he does that and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the world is returned to "normal"</span>, he keeps this as an emergency trump card and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finds himself using it to blackmail Yuki's boss</span>.
</li><li> Adult Mikuru convinces Kyon of her identity by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">showing him a distinctive mole on her breast — except Kyon didn't know about that yet, even though Mikuru claims he pointed it out to her.</span> Kyon uses this information to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">point this fact out to the younger Mikuru, turning the whole thing into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a></span>. It pops up later, too — he recognizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a fake Mikuru because she doesn't have the mole</span>, and he tries it again in <em>Disappearance</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on an alternate universe Mikuru, who calls him a pervert and punches him out</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, Yusuke possesses Kuwabara to try and tell Keiko that he's trying to come back to life and needs his body. She doesn't believe him, and he tries to come up with a Trust Password. So he gropes her breasts (or in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">TV version</a>, peeks up her skirt), causing her to reflexively slap him and yell "Yusuke, you jerk!" And in the end, she tells him that was unnecessary after all — she recognized his body language.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">plays with</a> the trope during the Chunin Exam. Sasuke Uchiha, having just defeated an impostor by recognizing him through sheer luck, decides it's necessary to give Trust Passwords to Sakura and Naruto in case they get separated again. However, he deliberately makes the password so complicated that he knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Naruto will never remember it</a> — so when an impostor impersonating Naruto shows up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">perfectly</a> recites the password, Sasuke knows it's a fake who was eavesdropping earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>:
<ul><li> A terrorist known as "Angel's Wing" (or "Angel Feathers" in the English dub) gives a Trust Password to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his blind, wheelchair-bound daughter</span> so that she'll know it's him even if she doesn't recognize it. At the end of the episode, he finds himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">captured in a chapel, when his daughter happens to enter. She gives her half of the password ("What is the angel planning to do today?") Batou knows both halves of the password, and he could give the right response (if only to make her happy), but he doesn't — he tells her, "The angel... isn't planning to go anywhere."</span>
</li><li> One of the final episodes in 2nd Gig has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> trying to send Rangers after Section 9. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They immediately stand down after running into Batou, a former Ranger; they can tell this immediately because all Rangers have the exact same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicEyes">Electronic Eyes</a>.</span>

To make sure he can't sneak back in among them again, Zoro comes up with a solution: each Straw Hat and Vivi should wear a white bandage over their arm <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to hide the <em>real</em> trust sign, a large X tatooed on their forearm</span>.
</li><li> In the Dressrosa arc, Luffy is reunited with someone he had thought long dead. Said individual starts asking about the time they stole Dadan's liquor to confirm his identity, but Luffy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp">glomping him</a> in joy before he can finish the sentence.

Rita is part of a controlled time loop; after every battle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue">she is sent back in time one day</a> to improve the outcome the next time around. Every battle, she asks everyone she can the same weird question (a different one every battle), like "Is it true that in Japan green tea is complimentary after a meal?" That way, if another looper ever shows up, they can prove their identity simply by answering the question before the battle even starts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em>, Makise Kurisu provides Okabe a trust password ("My Fork") to convince her past self that he came from future using technology she finished building a few minutes ago. Humorously, the password she uses is a very old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageBoards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageBoards">2ch meme</a> roughly meaning "lover", so past-Kurisu is horrified when Okabe uses it (fortunately for her, Okabe doesn't seem to recognize the meme).
<div class="indent"><strong>Okabe:</strong> What you want most right now is "My Fork"! <br/><strong>Kurisu:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat">WHAT!?</a> <br/><strong>Okabe:</strong> You already have "My Spoon", apparently. <br/><strong>Kurisu:</strong> I am going to <em>kill</em> my future self five hours from now...

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gilthunder's supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a></span> turns out to be a trust password.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is for the password to be very offensive to some group or collective that happens to be within earshot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">A beating ensues</a>.

An older Borges meets his younger self on a bench by a river. The older tells the younger details about their life that no one else could know.

In detail: In <em>Half Blood Prince</em>, the accepted wisdom is to pre-arrange these passwords with family members - an approach with obvious vulnerabilities - and the questions are asked in a way that doesn't afford much security should the impostor fail the test. In <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, the questions are random, and posed to the suspected impostor <em>at wandpoint</em>.

In the third book, main character Abby goes back in time and saves Leo, who calls her his "lady of light", and she asks him to promise to do something for the one who asks him to honor the vow. It gets more confusing from there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScienceOfDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScienceOfDiscworld">The Science of Discworld</a> II</em>, after traveling back in time, most of the wizards make a point of saying something to their past selves to prove that they are time travelers rather than doubles created by the elves. The exception is Rincewind, who is so jaded by everything that's happened to him in his very eventful life that he just walks up to his past self and says "hi".

After he is captured, the enemy claim to have sent a fake message that all is well, which presumably would not include the codeword. The twist is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the hero's boss is actually in league with the enemy, something he realises when his boss takes no action in response to an obviously fake message... which was probably never actually sent anyway</span>.
</li><li> <em>The Brotherhood of the Rose</em> by David Morrell. The CIA are following Saul until he makes contact with his surrogate brother Chris and they can both be killed. When Saul sets up the meeting, an underling urges spymaster Elliot to let them grab Saul and sweat the meeting place out of him. Elliot turns this idea down, pointing out that Chris and Saul have known each other since they were children and have codes and passwords dating back to then, so they've no way of being sure that Saul couldn't pass on a hidden warning.
</li><li> In the non-fiction <em>Don't Tell Mum I Work on the Oil Rigs, She Thinks I'm a Piano Player in a Whorehouse</em>, the Australian author Paul Carter is sent to work in Nigeria. He's given a code sentence — "It's hot here, just like Australia" with the reply to be: "Just as hot, but no kangaroos" (needless to say it wasn't an Australian who thought up this) — which the driver picking him up at the airport <em>must</em> give to avoid a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMyDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMyDriver">Not My Driver</a> trope ending in robbery and murder. The driver's reply is somewhat garbled in translation ("Yes, but no hot kangaroos") but Carter decides it's close enough.

The butler asks for this trope, in the form of what the item that is the source of his magical power is (information that every magician keeps a closely held-secret, due to the way magic works in this universe). Instead of naming an item, the character explodes in fury, refuses to reveal it, then comments that since he'd never told the butler in the first place, there was no reason for the butler to expect him to answer. <em>This</em> is the response that the butler was looking for, and he gladly lets him in.
</li><li> In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a> book, the titular character agrees that, when reporting to his handlers, if everything is okay, he'll preface his message by saying things are terrible. The wisdom for this being that if his cover was blown, his captors might make him report back saying "Everything is okay" - this was the signal that he needed rescuing.

The enemy attempts to portray themselves as a specific company of allies several times. Ventanus asks a question to identify them over the vox; "What is the number of the painted Eldar?". Whilst obviously a shibboleth, the trick here is that there are two different answers to the question (12 and 13) depending on the one asking or answering the question.

When Sandy needs to communicate with Hannay secretly, he says that he'll sign his messages with a letter of the Greek alphabet, then changes his mind, saying that he doesn't expect Hannay to know those, so he'll use champion racehorses instead. And so Hannay receives a series of messages signed with names of racehorses — none of which, he notes, are champions, because Sandy's knowledge of horse racing is even worse than Hannay's knowledge of Greek.

She mostly dismisses the weirdness of that because she's worked with supernatural objects, and weird comes with the territory. Although the secrecy annoys her she grudgingly extends limited trust to the texter, who seems to at least <em>know</em> her circle of friends.

<ul><li> Used again in Season 6, when the villainous Izel is capable of possessing people's bodies and imitating their mannerisms, but can't access their memories beyond what she already knows of them.

They don't know if the visitors from Ponyville are really them, so Cadance initiates the rhyme and Twilight reciprocates almost immediately, calming the guards down.</span>

<ul><li> Trust Passwords are naturally commonly used in the military and to detect spies:
<ul><li> A common way to accomplish this was with a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a word whose pronunciation is unique enough that only certain speakers can say it correctly. It's originally from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. It was also used commonly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, most deviously with the word "lollapalooza", which abused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage">the Japanese inability to pronounce the letter "L"</a> to allow Americans to weed out Japanese soldiers.
</li><li> Passwords on the expected invasion coast of Southern England might take a form like "Weymouth War Weapons Week" to make them even more difficult for any visiting Germans.
</li><li> One World War II variation was used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor">Bluff the Impostor</a>. The guard would state, "The land of the free", to which an American would reply, "And the home of the brave" — an easy reference to the national anthem. Then the guard would state "The terror of flight", and if the reply was "And the gloom of the grave", the guard knows it's really a German soldier — because only a spy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">trying too hard to pass as an American</a> would know the <em>third</em> verse of the anthem.
</li><li> According to tradition the phrase "schild en vriend" ( Flemish for "shield and friend") was used during the Matins of Bruges (1302) to weed out and slaughter the members of the French garrison because the "sch" sound was hard to pronounce correctly for French speakers. (some suggest it was actually meant to be " 's gilden vriend" ("friend of the guilds"- as in "Are you a friend of the guilds?") but there's little to no proof to support this)
</li><li> Secret agents are typically given several security checks they can insert into a message to verify that it's real. That said, they don't always work; a British agent captured by the Germans during World War II tried this, but his bosses didn't pay attention, and it led to <em>Das Englandspiel</em> (<em>a.k.a.</em> Operation North Pole) and the capture and execution of fifty Allied agents. What's scarier is the possibility that the bosses <em>did</em> get the message but considered their cover more valuable than the agent's life.
</li><li> Rafael Trujillo's genocide of the Haitian population in the Dominican Republic has gone down in history as the "parsley massacre": the Spanish word for parsley ("perejil") was used as a shibboleth to identify the creole-speaking Haitians.
</li><li> In modern military operations, ground troops will use code words to describe a situation to an extraction unit (usually a helicopter) rather than describing it outright; this allows them to call off an extraction if they're captured without tipping anyone off.
</li></ul></li><li> According to tradition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a> convinced the Dauphin that she had really been divinely inspired to help him claim the French throne by whispering a secret into his ear. That secret ranges from a prayer the Dauphin had said in private (which Joan could learn only from God Himself), to God wanting the Dauphin to be king, to describing an embarrassing birthmark on his backside.
</li><li> Magician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a> had spent much of his later career debunking mediums and others who claimed to speak "from beyond the grave". He debunked several mediums who tried to contact his mother and made the mistake of having her address him as "Harry" (which was his stage name, when she would use his real name, Erik) or speaking in English (when she was more confident in Hungarian or Yiddish). Houdini also arranged a number of code phrases (one being a song called "Rosabelle") with his wife Bess which he promised to use if he died before her and tried to contact her after death. He died in 1926, well before Bess, and no one was ever able to deliver a message she was satisfied was genuine.
</li><li> Careful parents often arrange these with their children, so that the children can verify that anyone who claims to be sent by mom and dad actually was. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">PSAs</a> also recommend this for if the family gets separated. This is the basis for a few fictional portrayals where the hero tries to save a kid in danger but needs the password from the parents.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/11/08/fairy-wrens-teach-secret-passwords-to-their-unborn-chicks-to-tell-them-apart-from-cuckoo-impostors/">Some birds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> teach these to their unhatched chicks, which then use the password in their begging calls. If the parents return to their nest and do not hear the password, they'll know that the nest has likely been taken over by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite">brood parasites<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and will abandon the nest.
</li><li> And in general, more people than you'd think have trust passwords just because they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>, or extremely nerdy. One old website was touted as a "time traveler's support network" which designated secret meeting places and times in various cities, where a "volunteer" would help anyone who used the correct password. The website is long since dead (not that this should be any problem for a time traveler anyway).
<ul><li> Some people even have passphrases for <em>themselves</em> in the off-chance that they somehow end up talking to their future selves.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the above example with children, news outlets have been recommending this in relation to the "grandparent scam," a scam in which someone calls up and pretends to be a family member and needs money. Recommended tips to avoid becoming a victim include "If you're suspicious, ask a question only a family member would know."
</li><li> The Mexican national anthem sometimes sees use as a means of proving people's identity, i.e. whether or not they are "true Mexicans". Japanese police officers once used it to identify four burglars they had just arrested. Needless to say, they turned out to be Colombians who had used forged Mexican passports, as discovered after they proved unable to sing it.
</li><li> Some websites that offer files for download (particularly open source projects and Linux distributions) publish cryptographic hashes of the download files in algorithms such as MD5, SHA or SHA2. A user can compute the hash on a downloaded file and compare it to the one on the website to verify a file's integrity.
</li><li> More informally, you can often tell an "outsider" by their pronunciation of certain words. For example, an Italian-American will know you're not a <em>paisan</em> if you use the "correct" pronunciations of prosciutto, capocollo, and sopressata instead of saying "bra-ZHOOT," "gabba-GOOL," and "super-SAHD."
