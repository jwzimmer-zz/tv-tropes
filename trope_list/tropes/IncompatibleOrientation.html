</li><li> Cuuko eventually develops feelings for Mahiro and starts advocating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome">threesome</a> solution; while Mahiro's straight, he still rejects the idea because Cuuko's proposal includes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction">I bear Nyarko's child,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">the Boy bears mine</a>". And finally, Cuuko has a cousin called Cuune who is so in love with her that she asked her to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise">Childhood Marriage Promise</a> with her (Cuuko was too young to understand the implication of it). Mahiro had to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a> to Cuuko so that Cuune would give up on Cuuko and so that Cuuko's love for Nyarko wouldn't come out and ruin everything.
</li><li> Of course, part of the story's whole hook is this. Mahiro is attracted to Nyarko as a person, but is put off by the knowledge that she's Nyarlathotep, the malign god of chaos and madness from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>. The fact that she could shatter his sanity just by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">changing forms</a>, and that she might be lying about being in love with him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">just to screw with him</a>, are deal-breakers in Mahiro's eyes, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">over time</a> he grows to accept her honesty and his true feelings for her.

</li><li> As of "Sadie Hawkins", Tina believes Blaine (gay) is her soulmate despite him turning her down for obvious reasons. Blaine has a massive crush on Sam (straight) but won't act on it because he doesn't want to be a "predatory gay" and because he's "proud that a gay guy can be friends with a straight guy."

Sherlock has a tongue-tied sexual fixation on Irene, while also feeling romantic love with no apparent physical dimension towards John. In short: the lesbian is in love with a man, the heterosexual man is in love with the same man, and the asexual is in love with both of them.

She also follows him home, sneaks into his house, masturbates on his bed and then <em>hides under it</em> while he is sleeping. Now you know how she got that name. The strangest thing about Sketch is that she is aware that Maxxie's gay and somehow thinks that by dressing in masculine clothes and binding her breasts, she'll break through the Incompatible Orientation barrier. When she decides to go after his best mate Anwar (who is straight) instead, she stops binding and starts wearing more frills and make-up.

</li><li> White Town's "Your Woman" (later covered by Tyler James), about a straight guy in love with a gay woman, which makes the line "I could never be your woman" kinda obvious. It could also be about a gay man who's in love with a straight man, but either way, it uses this trope.
</li><li> "She'll Never Be Your Man" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisCornell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisCornell">Chris Cornell</a>. All you can really say about this one is that it's about the bitterness and resentment of being dumped for someone else, but the details are up in the air. Is it about a straight man lamenting that his girlfriend left him for a lesbian? Or is it about a gay man lamenting that his boyfriend left him for a straight woman?

Three guesses as to what's holding him back, and the first two don't count.

Terra would very much like to fall in love with Zadok, but Terra's a lesbian earthworm and Zadok's a male grass golem. She briefly gets a personal fourth wall in order to lose the concept of lesbianism (solely an out-of-universe thing, since none of the characters are human and Terra is the only character with a metabolism), but self-deception is a turn-off for him. The philosopher of the group solves things by successfully arguing that applying the constraints of human biology to people without it is absurd. Love is therefore a function of personalities, and therefore limiting it is a violation of free will and their purpose as characters. Around <em>1/0</em>, we call this a Tuesday.

</li><li> It also has this times five, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">Gayngst</a> is one of the things Shive writes well:
<ul><li> Justin Tolkiberry (a gay male) has Melissa, a straight girl (and his former best friend) who was in love with him and refused to accept that he's not interested. (This changed during the "New and Old Flames" storyline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWriteTheThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWriteTheThing">much to Shive's surprise</a>.)

He claims that their relationship is a mutually beneficial one "for close comfort and pleasure". It hasn't been stated outright, but the vibes are that Noah is himself gay, or at least bi, and that Melissa saw her relationship with him as some sort of "proof" that Justin can be "cured". Later events reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Noah is likely part-Uryuom, whose attitudes can range from aromantic asexuals to romantic pansexuals</span>, so it's tough to tell.
</li><li> Susan had a crush on Justin before she learned he was gay. Notably, they're still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">very close</a>, relate to each other very well, and during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> party (which turned Susan into a bisexual man and Justin into a straight woman) they had a heartfelt moment which almost escalated into something they would have regretted.
</li><li> Justin himself is in love with his male friend Elliot Dunkel, who's straight.
</li><li> Worse still, when Elliot is in his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">mild-mannered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">girl</a>" form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody">he finds himself attracted to Justin</a>. Making this an Incompatible Orientation situation twice over.
</li><li> Nanase's relationship with Eliot turned out to be a case of this. Nanase liked him but wasn't really physically attracted to him. When she learned of Sarah's crush on Elliot, she ended the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> in short order by breaking up with Elliot and admitting she had just been going through the motions.

Susan even had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> about a date with Catalina, but she's well aware she's straight.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4rhv8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4rhv8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4rhv8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This gets a bit more complicated later, when she realises she <em>isn't</em> sure she's straight — she assumed she was because she doesn't want to have sex with women ... but she doesn't really want to have sex with men <em>either</em>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Susan:</strong> Could've been nice...

(Susan's mother is saddened that her daughter isn't attracted to women. This is mostly due to a traumatic event in Susan's childhood when she discovered her father was having an affair.)

Later, Dirk tells Jane with uncharacteristic sincerity that he truly wishes he could reciprocate Roxy's feelings because it would make things much easier for everyone involved, but his love for her is completely platonic.
</li><li> Alternian society is binormative so gender is rarely a dealbreaker for trolls, but other types of incompatibility are still possible. Karkat develops a doomed same-sex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">hatecrush</a> on John.

The interspecies romance between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dave and Terezi</span> falls apart not because of the troll partner's bisexuality but because of their <em>polyamory</em>. The monogamous human partner was not prepared for the troll norm of polyfidelity, though the fact that the troll partner was trying to keep the polyamory a secret didn't help.

Now also called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">brokeback</a> marriages" after more recent famous fictional examples.
</li><li> A depressing fact of life for many LGBTQ+ teenagers. Since only a small portion of the population is gay or bisexual, there's a strong chance that their crush will have an incompatible orientation, and asking about compatibility may be out of the question if they live in one of the many areas that are hostile to homosexuality. On top of that there's the universal problem of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">mutual attraction</a>. Adulthood usually offers more options for meeting people of compatible orientation but doesn't change the basic fact of LGBTQ+ sexualities being a minority.
</li><li> It's also a cliché that straight girls involved in theatre or music in high school will inevitably crush on at least one closeted gay guy.
</li><li> The dating website OkCupid installed a feature where gay and bi users can keep their profiles from showing up for straight people; one of the reasons was that a lot of straight users were attempting to date attractive gay members of the opposite sex on the site.
</li><li> Can happen between members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry Fandom</a>: one, a "light" fur who enjoys the fandom for fun but doesn't have a attraction to the animals and prefers their romantic partners to be of their own species, develops a crush on a fellow fur who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yiff">only interested in anthropomorphic animals</a> and thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreUgly">Humans Are Ugly</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56o7w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note56o7w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56o7w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">fandom</a> is actually mostly made up of the former despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a>, so this situation is rare. </span>
</li><li> Relationships between transgender people and their partners can end when they come out of the closet, and their partners' orientation doesn't match with their gender and/or new looks.
</li><li> Hand-raised birds often imprint on humans. When they get older, hormones drive them to take a mate, but as they believe themselves to be humans, their desired mate is usually their caretaker (who is usually not interested in birds that way). This can prove problematic if the bird in question is intended to be used for breeding, as they show no interest in mates they could produce offspring with - even if their intended mate puts on a dramatic courtship display. Other problems can arise, too, as the bird becomes increasingly frustrated that their attempts at pairing with a human aren't working; they may become aggressive to their caretaker ("How dare you spurn me!") or to others the bird perceives as competition.
