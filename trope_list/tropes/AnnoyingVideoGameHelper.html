</p><p>The character that has you screaming "Stop helping me!" is usually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> who either has an attitude problem or interrupts when you really wish they wouldn't. Sometimes it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">a party member who's a master of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a> — or who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">keeps getting overexcited and killing you with friendly fire</a>. In extreme cases, it's the character the player is controlling, if they're annoying/inept enough; stupid catchphrases and idiotic behavior during cutscenes have resulted in many a player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">wasting a life by directing their playing character off a cliff, just for revenge</a>.
</p><p>Unfortunately, these annoyances are never disposable characters. You're stuck with them for the entirety of the game. The best you can hope for is that they do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and become the bad guy's problem. In fact, sending them to the opposite faction might be a good tactical maneuver on your part. However, in that instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurphysLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurphysLaw">Murphy's Law</a> will kick in and they'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">just as effective fighting against you as they were ineffective fighting for you</a>. <em>C'est la vie.</em> At least you don't have to listen to their voice constantly and you finally have that excuse to kill them that you've been waiting all game for.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fact, most "guide" characters will try the player's patience if they've played the game through a couple of times — like the tutorial levels, they're not really needed after the first playthrough. And maybe not even then. Smarter game designers will give players the option of turning the character "off" when the player doesn't want their help, or the guide only helping when the player specifically asks him or her to.
</p><p>This should go without saying, but try to avoid sticking AI sidekicks in here that are simply not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">perfect</a>. If they can pull their own weight in a fight, but have different priorities and thresholds for doing things than a player might, then they probably don't belong here. (Complaining that the computer is trying to use its healing items on you earlier than you necessarily want it to, for example, does not make them this trope, especially in a game without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a>.)

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a></em>, Professor E. Gadd keeps calling you to gauge your abilities and give you advice, often sounding pushy in the process (and sometimes rushing you on top of it). This can get annoying sometimes, and can be distracting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kaepora Gaebora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">Majora's Mask</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures">Four Swords Adventures</a></em>, only shows up a relative few times, and he's not of the "Hey Listen!" variety, but is annoying solely on the fact that his text activates when you walk by certain places, whether you want them to or not. It consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">tens of screens</a> that you cycle through four or five times because mashing the A button to advance the dialogue quicker (which doesn't always work) results in him reaching the end and giving a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallIRepeatThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallIRepeatThat">would you like me to repeat that?</a>", which you accept by accident. (Everybody in the game but him defaults to "no" when it comes to asking if you want them to repeat.) At least his music is cool, and his dialogue can be mostly skipped entirely by pressing B past a certain point.
</li><li> The annoyance caused by Navi in <em>Ocarina of Time</em> is now legendary, e.g. her incessant cries of "Hey!", "Look!", "Listen!" and "Watch out!" and habit of popping up all the time to remind you where to go next. Navi's substitute in <em>Majora's Mask</em>, Tatl, has a less annoying set of audio cues, but she interrupts you with the same frequency.
</li><li> Tingle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> after receiving the Tingle Tuner. You can play as Tingle if you connect a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>. Let joy be unconfined. Pressing the A button on the GBA makes Link <em>drop everything</em> in order to look at a little green marker while it shouts "HAAAAAY" to get your attention. If even forces Link to retract his sail while at sea! Thank goodness you can at least turn off the volume on the blasted thing... The Tingle Tuner can even cause the game to crash by being used mid-deku hop.
</li><li> In the higher levels of the Gamecube <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures">The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures</a></em> Bonus-Game <em>Tetra's/Navi Trackers</em>, Tetra, Sue Belle, or The King of Red Lions (depending who is the current "anchor") will sometimes make Tingle appear to "aid" the players. Every word out of Tingle's mouth sounds like he is goading the player into shutting off the game. (The characters in <em>Navi Trackers</em> are fully-voiced, except for Link of course.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>: This was a bridge too far.
<ol><li> A certain gossip stone found late in the game will give you a simple explanation of what your current goal is and then ask if you'd like it to repeat that. Say yes and it will loop endlessly. Say no and the stone will respond with "Rumor has it that you're some kind of genius who remembers things perfectly the first time you hear them."
</li><li> The game already interrupts you every few minutes while playing. You got a blue rupee! You got a bug! Now add in Fi telling you where to go. (And her dialogue populates <em>so slowly</em> and you cant skip it.) A lot of her dialogue consists of run-on sentences reciting from a text box which appeared moments earlier. The game simply refuses to take <em>Zelda</em> veterans into account: Light a bomb and run forward to throw it. Right as you're was about to throw, Fi chimes in: <em>Master, the structural integrity of that wall appears to be compromised. Perhaps a large explosion would render it unstable, allowing us to pass through to the other side.</em> Meanwhile the whole time she is talking, the bomb is ticking away in your hands. The bomb blows up in your face, and then Fi appears again, and won't stop talking until she finishes telling you that collecting hearts will restore Link's health.
</li></ol></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>:
<ul><li> Downplayed with Zelda and the Champions, who frequently chime in to tell you <em>what</em> to do in dungeons, but not <em>how</em> to do it, and generally come across as encouraging rather than patronizing. The one exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Revali</a>, who is quite passive-aggressive, but seeing as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he blames Link for his own death at the hands of Windblight Ganon 100 years ago</span>, he's actually being an asshole to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Link</a> rather than the player.
</li><li> A straight example happens during the blood moon, which occurs randomly. Every time it happens, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">Cutscene</a> triggers showing monsters appearing with red eyes and Zelda saying: "The blood moon rises once again. Please be careful, Link." This is to let the players know that the monsters they killed have now been respawned. And the more monsters you kill, the faster the blood moon happens. This has caused many players in forums to ask if the blood moon can be stopped to halt the cutscenes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It can't.</span> But at least the cutscenes can be skipped when they start.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Cheshire Cat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanMcGeesAlice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanMcGeesAlice">American McGee's Alice</a></em>, while technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">an aversion of the trope</a>, is no less irritating. His "advice" consists mainly of cryptic insults, such as "There's a nasty name for those who insist on doing things the hard way." Granted, he only appears when summoned, and as such is less likely to induce homicidal rage in the player...unless the player is really in a bind, and all good ol' Cheshire can say is "Alice, you really suck." Sometimes he even gives you advice that is just plain untrue. For example, he tells you that using the Jacks when there are no enemies around is dangerous, like the Dice. They're actually harmless.
</li><li> Zip and Alister from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderLegend">Tomb Raider: Legend</a></em> have a way of "hinting" that reveals exactly how to solve whatever puzzle you were working on, as well as ruining the atmosphere with their babbling. Lara even lampshades this a little, by telling them to shut up when she's concentrating on some particularly tricky acrobatics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Roll tended to ramble over the radio at you every time you go into a dungeon. "Remember the last time we went on a dig? I wasn't used to being a spotter and you got trapped underground for three days." She goes off on this while you need to run (or jump) across platforms that break real easily and if you end up falling you have to do a U-turn and start over.
</li><li> Data is the "helpful" little cyborg monkey who <em>can't be killed</em>. <em>Ever</em>. You can unload the ultimate weapon in his face and he just... <em>keeps... dancing</em>. In fact, at the end, he turns up planetside after everyone else has gotten trapped on Elysium, despite being up there with you at the end. It's somewhat satisfying to imagine the others trusted to his invincibility when they sent him back down, assumedly by punting him off Elysium and letting him deal with re-entry and the inevitable high-speed landing on his own.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> Double H can sometimes get a bit... overly chatty. He enjoys screaming compliments at you in the middle of battle, when not continuously informing you of how he's "Awaiting your orders" — and if things have been quiet for too long, he'll throw in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"Carlson and Peeters!"</a> just to break the silence. He and Pey'j <em>both</em> have the annoying habit of nagging you to do things out of the blue — "Hey, let's go buy that Pearl Detector!" in the middle of a completely unrelated trek to a Looter's Cave.
</li><li> Or Pey'j asking you to give him a PA-1 (extra hit point) when a) it's more efficient to give your sidekick a lot of Starkos (each healing one hit point) and keep PA-1s and K-Bups (healing all hit points) for yourself, and b) he'll soon get captured anyway.

Hinting on how to fight the beholders? Fantastic. Repeating the same hint <em>over and over in the same tone of voice, even as I do what you tell me too?</em> That's it, into the forge. He gets even more annoying in the sequel, where the advice isn't even all that useful the first time.
</li><li> Taken to extreme levels in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation2">PS2</a> game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tokobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tokobot">Tokobot</a> Plus</em>. Upon gaining a new ability, you will be paused each time for the following: your "helper", Ruby, will wonder out loud what the new ability does, despite having an obvious name; she will analyze the ability's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> so she can give you an in depth explanation of what it does; after her inane chatter subsides, a window pops up giving a visual explanation of how to use the new ability, then <em>another window</em> pops up and repeats everything Ruby told you, and in case you weren't paying attention the first four times, Ruby will pause you again when you first need the ability <em>and give another explanation of how you use it.</em> This happens for <em>every new move you aquire.</em> In addition, Ruby will speak up about anything else you encounter and drop a hint about it, including: enemies, simple boss fights, obvious plot points, and puzzles. That's right, the game won't even let you solve its own puzzles without trying to help you <em>even before you even start solving it!</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em> - The Palace Guard who suggests you activate the palace defences. He then proceeds to loudly (and in a distinctly un-Persian accent) help you with the puzzlement, yelling "Careful! Think ahead!" whenever you go wrong. And all for nothing, because he is killed horribly and the defences actually make things harder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></em>, Mary Jane decides that she's tired of being the one that Spider-Man has to save and she decides to become an action girl. She grabs a shotgun and decides to help you during the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Symbiote Black Cat</span> boss fight... except her shotgun does <em>nothing</em> to the symbiotes, the enemies that spawn during the fight rush her and not you, and you fail the mission if she dies. This forces you to constantly break off an already difficult boss fight so that you can save her stupid ass. Made worse by the fact that Mary Jane is very displeased with Spider-Man's use of the black suit and the vast majority of her dialogue in the game is her nagging you.
</li><li> In the game adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">the 2012 film</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>, Spider-Man <em>himself</em> is a bad case of this trope. If there is an object in the environment that you need to interact with—like turning wheels to drain water from a tank—Spider-Man will remind you <em>every 15 seconds</em>. It's been timed.
</li><li> An interesting case of this probably being intentional: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, the Bane "find the TITAN" side mission has Batman (the player character) teaming up with Bane to destroy all the containers of TITAN in Arkham City. The finale of the mission begins with you talking to Bane, telling him you destroyed your assigned six Titan containers, and then a bunch of TYGER security guards or random thugs showing up to fight you; in the subsequent fight, Bane fights alongside you, but is more of hinderance then a help, as he throws around the enemies and swings wildly, hitting Batman in the process. It makes a lot of sense when you discover that Bane <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was planning to betray you all along</span>.

More annoying still is that when she starts talking, you have to stop what you're doing and press the "Call" button to move her monologue along so you can get on with that heart transplant. <em>Extremely</em> annoying when playing a mission that requires speed. Thankfully, she's a lot less annoying in the Wii remake, <em>Second Opinion</em>.
</li><li> She gets worse in <em>Under the Knife 2</em>. Despite having performed the same operation dozens of times before, she feels the need to interrupt your intense concentration with repetitive instructions that don't serve any purpose beyond throwing you off. This is especially prevalent in the last few missions, where a single mistake can lead to immediate death.

He also gets in the way of your attacks and any objects you're trying to move, hindering your puzzle-solving and enemy-killing.

Except that's not all that's grating about him. It's been counted and Issun says "You hear that, Ammy?" some 60ish times during the game and it's due to the fact that Amaterasu cannot understand animals.

Not only are most of his warnings about really obvious dangers ("No, Graham! Don't!"), they are generally given only when it's already too late to stop yourself.

Later, when Bishop's squadmates are recalled back to replace Logan Keller's lost squad, Bishop decides to track down the apparent terrorist mastermind, Alvarez Cabrero to an oil facility, and the NSA agent shows up to accompany them. The agent's help mainly consists of him distracting you during tense situations again, failing at giving you reliable intel, asking you to go do something else for him, and generally being completely useless.

Tell them to rappel or fast-rope from railings and, when they don't try to walk through you to get to it, fail to phase through you, and give up while telling you they "can't do that", they'll force you to walk them through every single step of getting onto the rope and walking down it - often once each for both of them, since even if there's <em>five or more</em> rappel points right next to each other <em>and</em> you point to a specific spot on the ground rather than the rappel point itself, they'll both insist on taking the same rope. Try to strategically move them up from cover to cover, and on the rare occasions they don't choose to move up via whichever path requires them to try and push you out of <em>your</em> cover (or get stuck on you again and decide you really wanted them right on top of yourself), they'll get <em>stuck on thin air</em>.

When they pull this stunt during the last sprint to the rescue vehicle, it can easily get you killed. Valve thankfully patched it so you could cancel the healing by pulling out your own pills or first aid kit. However, this means that in instances where you're trying to conserve health supplies, you, the only one currently focused on actually shooting the zombies, have to put away your gun and stop shooting the zombies until the AI takes the hint. Also, the AI will gleefully toss you pain pills if you don't have any while you are low on health, but they will usually do so while you are shooting and you will likely down the pills without even trying.

It can become quite common for an AI survivor to try to heal you and you see a Charger running towards you or a Spitter spits on you as you are being healed, forcing you to take damage until the AI either finishes healing you or is also hit by the spit and forces them to move.

Particularly annoying if you're trying repeatedly to get the achievement. The message will play even if you've already switched to your other weapon and thus the magazines are running dry on both.

<ul><li> Dogmeat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> doesn't have any tactics beyond "stay here and don't move" and "immediately attack anything within range." This frequently leads to him leaping between you and an enemy ... just as you're unloading several shotgun shells or lasers in that direction. Other companions don't fare much better, especially if they decide for you that you want them to use melee weapons, which frequently means your trips through the wasteland are interrupted by realizing they've rushed off to engage enemies so far off you can't even see them beyond the markers on your compass.
</li><li> The anonymous young lady who abruptly cutscene-stops you <em>every single time</em> you enter Megaton and almost every time you leave a building in Megaton to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">spend five minutes to zoom-lock the camera on herself</a> and tell you just how much you're appreciated and to give you a (usually) cheap and barely useful item. Forget the Talon Mercenaries, <em>this</em> is the game's real punishment for having overly high Karma.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, the Old World Blues Stealth Suit Mk II becomes this. She/It will inject you with Med-X at the start of a fight (which can easily get you addicted to it if you let her/it) and will inject you with Stimpaks very frequently, even if you don't need it (possibly getting you sick AND burning expensive items when they weren't needed). In addition to this, she regularly cracks the joke "Starting combat... just kidding." Especially bad when in an already tense situation.
</li><li> Dogmeat is unfortunately not much better in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> at times, simply because he has the ability to find and retrieve items nearby. Whilst this can sometimes be something useful or interesting, it may occasionally just be a packet of cigarettes. Worse, however, is that Dogmeat disregards anything between himself and the object of interest; he'll gleefully run across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandMineGoesClick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandMineGoesClick">landmines</a> and through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserHallway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserHallway">laser tripwires</a> to bring it back.

It takes almost every opportunity to do this, not just every time you kill an enemy and pick up a weapon for the first time, but in response to countless environments throughout the game. And the information is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">something the player either already knows or can figure out almost immediately</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">something completely unimportant</a>.

However, these messages interfere with Elizabeth throwing supplies (like health) to Booker during combat, creating situations where the help messages can kill you.

Any mission she dies in automatically fails, so her lack of awareness has frustrated many a player. When she finally gets her own gun late in the game, she's about as adept at firing bullets as she is at dodging them, so she'll just alert guards to your presence without dispatching them. Made even worse in Control, where the guards actually start <em>trying</em> to kill her.

At this point, the battle becomes ten times harder, since they mapped the button you use to control Virgil (which is useless anyway since he mirrors your moves for the most part) to your style button, depriving you of many of your more powerful moves, which far outweighs Virgil's meager contribution. Plus, you can't use your devil trigger; no healing or extra damage for you.

Even worse, you can't even get the giant mech to stop by killing it, because it's <em>on your side!</em>
</li><li> Your AI allies idea of attacking bosses is to run face-first into said boss and hit it with only basic moves, usually getting their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">ass handed to them</a>. This is particularly bad in missions where some ignoramus of a mission designer decided it was a good idea to make the mission fail if said ally dies.

It got particularly frustrating in 2, where enemy officers could recover health or get temporary power-ups when knocked down... which is what any fully-executed combo will do to them (and the only one which doesn't stuns them, meaning any <em>subsequent</em> hit will knock them down). When fighting alone, this could be avoided. When fighting with allies around... yeah, good luck with getting a quick win there.

</li><li> FLUDD from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> chimes in occasionally to give you advice, via a text box and the audio cue "Mario!". Whilst this can be annoying at times (especially because the advice he gives isn't usually that helpful), he's nowhere <em>near</em> as annoying as some of the others on this list because his text box doesn't intrude on the game or distract you too much.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em> series, there is an on-screen indicator to shake the Wii-mote at incredibly obvious places (such as spinning in a launch star), even more in the second game. Three things make this extra annoying: It makes a sound which gets grating fast, it always pops up, even if you have already been to the level, and it has the tendency to pop up <em>after you have performed the indicated action!</em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, Rosalina is replaced by a fat, purple Luma who will constantly suggest you take a break whenever you're having trouble with a level.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> franchise has an ample supply of these:
<ul><li> Anyone who's ever played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic 2</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">3</a></em> knows just how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">useless furry liability</a> Tails is as your tag-along, thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>; while he <em>can</em> be used as a nifty little immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> against enemies, more often than not he gets in your way, pushes buttons or destroys enemies/collapsible areas that you were wanting to use as platforms, and stupidly runs into ludicrous danger on his own. Making matters worse, when a second player tries to control him, the AI constantly attempts to take back over.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">duology</a>:
<ul><li> Tikal appears throughout <em>SA1</em>'s stages and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel">hub areas</a> as a glowing ball of light which dispenses hints when bumped into. Many of her hints are rather obvious in context, and consequently tend to only be at all useful if you stopped playing the game for a long time and need to quickly discern where you left off. Hints also stop your movement, leading to time loss or even death if you are in mid-jump in front of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>. Additionally, some challenges require the player to finish stages without any hints - the challenge often comes less from playing without the extra help, and more from dodging the hints themselves, since accidentally touching one disqualifies you immediately.
</li><li> Tails tags along in some <em>SA1</em> stages, picking up things whether you want them or not, such as animals that you can take into the Chao Gardens<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fly4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fly4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fly4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">you can only bring the last 10 animals you found back to the Gardens, so if Tails picks some up, he can push desired ones out of the queue</span>, among some other undesirable moments.
</li><li> The floating help TVs in <em>Sonic Adventure 1</em> and <em>2</em> cause the button which is normally used for attack/pick up/put down to instead function as "tell me info I probably know already" if you're near them. This can cause issues if you try to do anything else which uses that button while standing near a TV, leading to such things as trying to put down the animal you're holding, only to be stuck standing there reading "Welcome to the Chao Races" or some such just long enough for a Chao to come over and grab the animal, thus altering its stats, appearance and behavior in ways you didn't want it to. In Knuckles and Rouge's hunting stages, using the hint TVs damages your score, possibly ruining that A-rank you were going after and forcing you to replay the stage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>, Omochao provides "hints" which consist mostly of overly obvious statements and are often difficult to avoid, and as a result has driven many a player to frustration, leading some to dish out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">Videogame Cruelty Potential</a> against him. Apparently as a reaction to peoples' negative opinions on Omochao, he appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy">Sonic Advance</a> 3</em>, but you have to press up on the D-pad to pick him up and get his help, doing so stops time, and many of his lines are vague hints regarding the locations of the hidden Chao, which are needed for unlocking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>. He also receives some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy">Take That, Scrappy!</a> moments throughout the franchise due to his infamous behavior in his debut.
</li></ul></li><li> Some later games pair you up with other main characters, so this concept ends up making Tails and Knuckles a lot more annoying than they needed to be, especially since their hints are less avoidable than those provided by Tikal and Omochao.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>, you usually had to touch a "?" symbol to activate your partner's help, much like Omochao in the <em>Adventure</em> games. While it is still too easy to accidentally touch the help spot, no games in the series force you to hear the majority of help spots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> also uses the "?" symbol in the PS3/360 version, but in the Wii/PS2 Version, Chip will stop the game to tell you something important if necessary, like how to turn a lever, even if you have already done that.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">ROM hack</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20OmoChao%20Edition">Sonic the Hedgehog OmoChao Edition<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, turns Omochao into a Most Triumphant Example of this trope. Why? Because he stops time to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a> comment for most of the actions you can do in the game while the 1up jingle plays. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">The more stuff he says, the longer it takes for the jingle to stop.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em> actually has Exposition Fairies that <em>compete</em> for your attention, one trying to convince you to take the Hero Mission and the other trying to convince you to take the Dark Mission! You cannot stop them from competing—even if you choose one mission, the helper character for the other mission will pop up in the stage at another time, and this continues back and forth, back and forth... <em>and they will talk the entire time</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles">Sonic Chronicles</a>: The Dark Brotherhood</em> mostly plays this straight by making Tails the designated tutorial exposition character. It also subverts it by allowing the player to shut him up, with some dialogue options that make Sonic sound like a complete jackass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>:
<ul><li> Omochao will start speaking once you pass him. In the challenge missions, this can be annoying. Even the first level of the game, he pops in to say that he's there to help. Luckily, you can turn him off.
</li><li> For the final boss of Generations, all your friends will warn you about the homing shot. It's so bad that it will drown out the one line of dialogue that is actually <em>useful!</em>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>

Appearing only in the darkness "Torchlight Trouble" level, his role is to illuminate a small portion of the screen... And to shine his little flashlight in the player's eyes whenever your character turns around. Stupid bird. Likewise for Glimmer the Anglerfish in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest">second game</a>. Possibly even worse, since it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheDrain">swimming level</a>. Fortunately, these issues were fixed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Virtual Console</a> releases of the games.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>, Squawks also shows up to give you a brief tutorial whenever you first see something or use an ability. Normally annoying (yes, we <em>know</em> each new character has five bananas to find in each stage), but it gets even worse when you factor in that it <em>doesn't stop the action around you</em>. Dazzling Addar's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> of the game demonstrates this, as such a tutorial directly costs him a race.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Tutorial Pig</a> qualifies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a></em>. Die eight or ten times in one level, and he will appear at the beginning of the level and at every checkpoint jingling and waving his little flag trying to get you to use the Super Guide option. The only way to make him go away is by beating that level... and then, if you go back to the level to get items and die a bunch again, he <em>comes back</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroAHerosTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroAHerosTail">Spyro: A Hero's Tail</a></em> has Trina the fairy, who pops up whenever Spyro comes across something he hasn't before. She doesn't speak, but her text bubble takes up almost half the screen, often obscuring the very thing she's trying to explain about, and continues to stay on the screen unless you move away from that new thing. Then if you go back to it she pops up again with her infernal text bubble still in place.
</li><li> Alia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em> would sit in Maverick Hunter HQ and serve as your character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>. Unfortunately, whenever she decided she needed to talk to you about something, the game would force you to stop and listen, often interrupting a precision jump or maneuver in the process. Not only does this break the flow of the stages (especially Burn Dinorex's and Spiral Pegasus's), but a lot of the time, Alia has nothing to tell you that you couldn't have already figured out on your own. Future titles in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series would add options to ignore Alia, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8">Mega Man X8</a></em> giving you the option to just not have a Navigator at all.
<ul><li> Of course, <em>X8</em> also goes to lengths to make the Navigators less annoying when you <em>do</em> use them. Alia is no longer the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a> she was in <em>X5</em>, and will actually point out things of interest. The two new Navigators, Layer and Pallette, are actually somewhat useful; the former tells you boss weaknesses, while the latter points out secrets and hints at solutions to puzzles. All three can also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> in the game, though none can be upgraded with Metals.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyNo9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyNo9">Mighty No. 9</a></em>, following on the worst traditions of its spiritual predecessor, has a lot of moments of characters popping in to interrupt the gameplay to explain the obvious or just provide exposition or banter. This is particularly lethal, as not only can they drown out in-game audio cues, but the large text box they use to talk with can end up literally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">covering up the fight</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em> has Crystal and Clem, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">psychotic cheerleaders</a> — sort of. They only appear in a few places, but when they do, they mercilessly cheer and scream for Raz, much to his chagrin. The first time you encounter them, they're rooting for you while you play a mini-game.

However, if pressed for more and more cheers, Crystal will eventually break down into tears, admitting that she is a godawful cheerleader and her life is a sham. They can also be seen mixing poison in glass vials they will hide behind their backs if the player gets near.

And made worse if you let them kill enemy Command Stations with another option, increasing the AIP gain even more (on the plus side, "free" planet!).

But in the Saladin campaign, you have to defend two allies, Aqaba and Medina. Theoretically, Aqaba and Medina will tell you when they're being attacked; one of the win conditions is that you need to make sure the Crusaders don't destroy Aqaba and Medina, so accurate messages about when they're being attacked are, in theory, helpful. In practice, you start this level with virtually no resources or military units, meaning you'll be stuck listening to them scream for help when there's nothing you can do, since you need to save your handful of underpowered cavalry for when your base gets attacked. Also, they'll sometimes broadcast the voice clip even when there's nothing left on the main landmass to attack them.

In the same part of the game, Garet's AI will get trigger-happy with summons if you have enough Djinn on standby (like if you'd wanted to adjust Matthew's and Karis's classes), regardless of the enemy you're facing.

Sometimes, this is helpful, like telling you how to knock down Djinn in high places.

Plus he also heals you and often serves as a distraction for large monsters, giving you the space to heal or ready an attack. On the other hand his habit of running straight forward in front of you when attacking the same monster makes him highly annoying for Gunners, especially when trying to use special ammunition that's usually <em>very</em> limited in count. Also occasionally <em>blowing you up</em> in the middle of a combo when using the Feylyne Mask (thankfully, his bombs don't hurt you).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> series:

They will always repeat this every single time you go from one region to another. According to the developers, the <em>Claptrap's Robot Revolution</em> DLC is partly meant for players to vent their frustrations on the little buggers since they're the main enemies of the DLC. Depending on how you see it this works because now you can kill waves of them or it's terrible because you now have to deal with waves of these trashcans yelling the same lines over and over at the top of their shrill little voices.

<ul><li> The character Gaige's special ability is based around getting bonus points every time she kills an enemy.

</li><li> On one particular mission, there is a related issue where you need to hurt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Varkidss</a> and watch it go into a pod of sorts. You are then to inject the pod to let the bug mutate and then kill the monstrosity so Sir Hammerlock can research them for his book. It's possible to blow the pod up prematurely, however, and of course this happens to be the area of the game where you have a computer-controlled sniper ally take out enemies for you whether you want him to or not. Said sniper can also inadvertently get the player killed by sniping an enemy the player needed for a Second Wind. Especially on True Vault Hunter and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, where enemies are stronger and better armored, it's a common strategy for players to keep an enemy alive but low on health in case they need a quick kill revive. And Mordecai just loves picking off enemies who are low on health (itself an annoyance, since the player doesn't get XP if an NPC gets the killing blow).
</li><li> Any time an NPC fights alongside you can cause a headache. The NPC's do almost no damage at all, but it's somehow always enough to kill that weakened enemy you were aiming to get a Second Wind from. Lilith is the worst offender, as she can appear from nowhere, meaning you can't plan around her when choosing a target..

Just cleaned out your PC? Switched computers? Cue Fennel blabbering on about how to plants seeds/water your garden/use the share shelf...even though your garden is ready to harvest and your share shelf is full. Oh, and did we mention you only have access to the Dream World for an hour, after which it boots you off until exactly a day later? If you then rush to the Tree of Dreams to collect the Pokémon you want to download, you'll be stalled by Fennel telling you how magnificent the tree is, and how to make a wish. Which may cost you the Pokémon if the time runs out, especially if your internet connection tends to lag.
</li><li> Similarly, the original Pokémon TCG video game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> made you sit through the long, detailed and complicated tutorial with every new character. No skip option. In fact, <a class="urllink" href="http://tasvideos.org/1637M.html">if you beat the game as fast as physically possible for the game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it eats up half the play time.
</li><li> The catching tutorial in EVERY main series game. They're not so bad the first time around, but they can get annoying after multiple playthroughs of the same game. At that point, you've probably caught your first Pokémon. Or a few. Or <em>several</em>. Even if you're new to the franchise, it's pretty simple.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em>, there are three points where an NPC will instantly transport you to a location that required some backtracking to get back to in the original games: after the Meteor Falls event, you'll automatically be sent back to Fallarbor Town and then will have the option to be taken back to Mauville City; after getting the fourth badge, you'll have the option to be taken directly to Petalburg City; and after getting the fifth badge in Petalburg, you'll automatically be taken back to Mauville. Generally speaking, if the game gives you a choice in the matter, it's a shortcut you actually want to take, and if it doesn't give you a choice, it's one you <em>don't</em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25uos');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25uos" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25uos');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the original game, the event that you're transported back to Fallarbor for took place on site at Meteor Falls instead, and it was probably equally efficient to head onwards through Meteor Falls and loop back through Rusturf Tunnel, with the added bonus of exploring new areas—but since you're in Fallarbor now anyway, Mauville's definitely closer to the Cable Car to the top of Mt. Chimney. Going directly to Petalburg and the fifth badge after getting the fourth one is a <em>huge</em> timesaver as at the moment there's almost no straightforward path between Lavaridge and Petalburg, but after getting the Balance Badge, you gain the ability to Surf, so it's more convenient for exploration purposes to remain in Petalburg.</span> It's particularly noteworthy about being taken straight from Petalburg to Mauville is that the player's mother gives the immensely useful Amulet Coin after beating Norman and players have now gone from "30 seconds biking" to "Half the map away".
</li><li> The Rotom Dex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Sun and Moon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> (especially the latter) may very well be the new Navi in terms of sheer annoyance to the player. It constantly gives "hints" (often things that even a series beginner would know halfway through the game like to remember to go to Pokémon Centers) to the player seemingly every time the player moves, such as closing a menu or leaving a building, blocking the mini-map until it finishes giving you a message and often parroting the same hints over and over again. The icing on the cake is that there's no way to make the Rotom Dex <em>stop</em> giving you these useless hints.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Sword and Shield</a></em>: Max Raid Battles are definitely some of the more difficult parts of the game, with exclusive Pokémon forms being locked behind them. Without an internet connection (or friends to help locally), you're given three randomly chosen AI partners. If you're lucky, you'll get okay ones. Other times, you'll get ones that are useless or <em>actively harmful</em>:
<ul><li> The AI partners are chosen completely at random by the game, and there is no way to even know which ones you'll be stuck with until the battle begins, so you can't even reliably prepare to counter their idiocy. This also means that you might get Pokémon that are that are terrible against the enemy Pokémon. Don't be surprised if someone brings something with a type disadvantage. You might also get a genius who brings e.g. Torkal with the Drought ability (which makes it summon harsh sunlight that increases the power of Fire-type moves) to a battle with a Fire-type enemy. Torkoal also makes bringing in a Water-type risky, since the same harsh sunlight will weaken Water-type moves.
</li><li> The battle ends once four Pokémon on your side are knocked out, and the NPC mons recover about a turn or two after being knocked out. This means that any weak and useless teammates will happily revive themselves just to get knocked out again until you reach the cumulative limit of four and automatically lose through no fault of your own.
</li><li> Poké Kid Freya, while she has three attacking moves, somehow thinks the best course of action in a lot of the Raid Battles is to not use any of them and just spam nothing but Helping Hand. The power boost from it is hardly noticeable, and most of the time she'll use it when the Dynamaxed 'mon has their shield up, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">artificially lengthens the fight</a>.
</li><li> Gentleman Martin has a Solrock, which has two attacking moves in Psychic and Rock Throw. Unfortunately, like Freya, he almost never uses his attacking moves. Instead, he spams Cosmic Power while sometimes throwing in a Rock Polish for some variety. Stat-boosting moves like Cosmic Power and Rock Polish are absolutely useless in Max Raid Battles since the Dynamaxed opponent has the ability to get rid of all stat boosts on your side of the field, which it does often, so Martin effectively wastes all of his turns.
</li><li> Cabbie Alfie brings a <em>Wobbuffet</em> to battle. Wobbuffet is a unique Pokémon, as it's unable to deal damage directly, only through counterattacks. This makes it an extremely poor choice for a Max Raid Battle, as it's hard to tell if the opposing Pokemon will even target it or not, and what moves they'll have. It's already a crapshoot hitting them, but Alfie somehow makes it even worse, as he spends the fights either spamming Safeguard (which is nigh-useless considering a lot of Raid 'mons never even use status effects) or Amnesia (a stat-boosting move, which is useless because (1) Wobbuffet already has high defenses, and (2) the Dynamaxed opponent can and will get rid of all stat boosts on your side of the field). On the rare occasions it does manage to hit, it can do a good amount of damage, but a lot of the time, it ends up falling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.
</li><li> Beauty Catherine's Togepi has three attacking moves, but constantly spams Life Dew (heals all allies by 25%), even when all allies have full HP. This is also an issue for Backpacker Amelia's Clefairy, who has the same move.
</li><li> In addition to Life Dew, Amelia's Clefairy will also spam Follow Me. While a useful move that can keep the other NPC allies from (initially) taking damage, Clefairy itself will be most likely to fall first, and it isn't exactly a bulky Pokémon. This is even more annoying if you get both Amelia and Alfie — if she uses Follow Me, she'll force the opponent to target her Clefairy even if Alfie's Wobbuffet is targeted and he picks the correct counterattack. At the very least she gives her Clefairy a Focus Sash to hold.
</li><li> Black Belt Oscar has a Hawlucha, which is a fast and strong (albeit frail) Pokémon with three attacking moves. Unfortunately, for reasons beyond comprehension, it will often forego using any of these moves to use its fourth move, Feather Dance, a move that harshly lowers the opponent's Attack stat. The problem is that Raid Pokémon in 3-star raids and higher, once they take enough damage, put up a barrier that nullifies moves that lower stats, with 5-star Raid Pokemon putting up barriers twice. If the RNG is not on your side, you'll be seeing Oscar's Hawlucha waste turns using Feather Dance on 5-star Pokémon, potentially making it as annoying and useless as Solrock or even Wobbuffet. It doesn't even get a Focus Sash to offset its frailty, meaning it'll often feed two free KOs to the Raid Pokémon.
</li><li> Pokémon Breeder Kit's Dhelmise is pretty troublesome just because it can't take a hit and is very slow, making it rapidly use up your 4-KO allotment. Many of the trainers bring a Focus Sash so they can survive at least one attack, but Dhelmise doesn't even get that. If it doesn't immediately faint, it likes to use Slam, which misses 25% of the time.
</li><li> A more situational example is Office Worker Dean and his Throh. It only knows Fighting and Normal-type moves, which means he'll be <em>completely useless</em> in the event the game sticks you with him in a Raid Battle against a Ghost-type.

Mission control's "help" becomes even more absurd if <em>you are also injured</em> — sometimes even closer to death than your teammate — and Fuuka will tell you, "I'm worried about Akihiko-senpai!" Well, <em>thanks</em>. She'll also ask you if there's a healing item for any character caught by a status effect, even if that character has the equivalent skill and will be more than able to heal during their turn. If <em>you're</em> the only one suffering from a status effect, she'll either tell you to fix yourself or count the number of enemies, but not tell your team members to help you. Fuuka's chatter is particularly annoying because it's clearly generated at random, so not only do you have to endure her stock phrases every time you fight, you'll also be treated to the same information with intonations that are completely at odds with the situation. And then, sometimes, she's just wrong: go to Monad alone on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and there's a good chance at least one victory will end with her congratulating the <em>team</em>.

It's as if they wanted to compensate for the fact that her voice acting is a million times better than Fuuka's by having her <em>talk a million times more.</em> Though her predecessor, Teddie, can be plenty annoying in his own right, since both of them are, like Fuuka, repeating information you already have on the screen (and unlike Fuuka, they don't know anything more about the enemy's strengths and weaknesses than what you've learned by trial and error).
</li><li> Combat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> is <em>also</em> full of these moments. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManualLeaderAIParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManualLeaderAIParty">Manual Leader, A.I. Party</a> in effect, there's no way to make it through the initial playthrough without at least one mission turning into a murder-suicide. It is possible to become familiar enough with the AI that you can reasonably predict what your allies will do, but even that isn't foolproof. To wit:
<ul><li> God help you if you've knocked a group of enemies down and <em>know</em> that an All Out Attack won't finish the job. Since attacking again puts the enemy on its feet, your best move is to leave the enemy down, causing it to waste its turn standing up. Your allies, however, have other ideas. If no one in your party is injured enough to trigger the Healer to, well, <em>heal</em>, then that person will attack with their weapon, give the enemy their turn back, and leave you to take massive damage. During the final boss fight, you <em>have</em> to put your party members on Standby in order to keep them from repeatedly damaging themselves with reflected attacks. It's very annoying until you figure out that you can set their basic parameters to prioritize knocking the enemy down.
</li><li> Junpei is one of the game's offensive powerhouses, but physical attacks are cast from hit points. Although he tends to maintain a higher-than-average number of them, he also will refuse to conserve them, even if you equip him with his ultimate weapon. Why use a sword that does 450 damage with 100 accuracy when you can use 50 of your last 200 HP to do less damage? Despite having fire skills, he'll <em>still</em> tend to use physical attacks instead of elemental ones, even if the opponent is weak to fire. There's something to be said about the fact that fights sometimes become much, much easier once your team is dead (including the Healer, who never got around to healing you, as they were busy with reincarnation).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo">Custom Robo</a></em>, at the beginning of almost every fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Harry</a> will give you advice whether you want it or not. Occasionally he gives you good tactical suggestions and what to do against certain enemy types, but most of it is useless or obvious. Furthermore, he also asks if you understood all of it, in case you want to hear it again. On a few occasions, you can confuse him with odd responses ("Wait, who are you again?" "Sorry, I was sleeping.") but those will always set him off advising again.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest Star Party Members</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> are usually fine, but trying to steal Phoenix Downs while Desch is there is an exercise in frustration. Particularly when you think you're okay and then he shows up <em>several</em> turns in to kill the monster. Also, the guests are sometimes conspicuous by their absence when you could really use a healing boost or an extra punch against a boss.
</li><li> Quistis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> likes to explain junctioning and limit breaks in nauseating detail — at one point, she asks Squall something to the effect of "Do you know how to use your Gunblade?"/"how to junction magic?", even though after Squall has taken on his rival Seifer, the summon Ifrit, numerous monsters, the military of one of the most powerful nations in the world, and a gigantic robot; and now has graduated to being a full-fledged member of the most elite fighting force on the planet, it's not too outrageous to assume that he knows how to fight.
</li><li> The AI partners equipped with The Wanderer's Sigil: Cheer in the Comrades multiplayer expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>. Cheer is an ability that grants up to five boosts to the party, with the spell replacing a players ability to cast offensive spells. Should you be playing with AI characters instead of other players, there's a chance either Sadda or Mat Kishimoto can join you on a mission along with two other AI, and both of them always have Cheer. However, they will constantly spam the ability more often than help you fight, purposefully going up next to your character and using Cheer over and over again. This even happens in harder missions when the other two party members die, leaving you to fight essentially by yourself. While the other AI characters are smarter when using their sigils, you'll likely be yelling at these characters and dreading seeing them spawn in your camp.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma">Dragon's Dogma</a></em>, Pawns will repeatedly remind you of things you already know from experience, like wolves roam in packs, goblins hate fire, a fall from high up means death, and that treading in waist high water will kill you, repeating these "suggestions" to you over and over again, sometimes, in a row.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series in general has the starting/character generation sequences. They are really helpful on your first playthrough, since they double as tutorials and introduce the game's plot. On your second playthrough, you start to hate the sequences. Mods abound that speed this up by removing the tutorials and plot events.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>
<ul><li> Followers have a bad habit of rushing any enemy they see. This can have one of two effects: 1) They rush an enemy that's way too strong for them, or 2) they run in between you and the enemy just as you're using a power strike, killing or seriously injuring them. If their survival was important to the quest you need to restart from the last save now. Hitting your partner also has a tendency to cause them to attack you, meaning you have to yield to them to get them to stop. Thank the nine for "Essential" partners (who can't be killed, only knocked unconcious).
</li><li> One horse, Shadowmere, is marked as Essential. She also has a bad habit of rushing every enemy in sight, meaning you need to worry about the above issue with your freaking horse, which is much easier to accidentally hit and isn't a very good fighter. While she won't turn hostile on you, hitting her sometimes counts as "Assaulting a Guild Mate" which will get you kicked out of 3 of the 4 guilds (you can no longer get kicked out of the Dark Brotherhood after the mission you get Shadowmere in).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> has the same problem with followers as Oblivion, especially the melee fighters. Their entire strategy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> which causes problems for every fighting style. Fighting with them in confined spaces makes them easy to kill on accident, they act as meat shields for enemies (especially frustrating as heavy hitting, low mobility two handed fighters) and they can hit allies who will become hostile. Quest giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> can be murdered by your followers after being hit by friendly fire during a fight with a mudcrab or something, causing you to fail the quest. The best you can do is equip your followers with overpowered weapons, so you can assume they'll take care of the enemy and turn your attention elsewhere.
</li><li> Something which occurs with companions in both the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games: They're useless to stealth focused players. The companion will either attack an enemy that you're trying to sneak up on as soon as their A.I. detects the enemy, the enemy will notice your companion before you because their sneak skill is inferior to yours, and either attack the companion or come to investigate and blow your cover, or the companion will start attacking the enemy as soon as it becomes suspicious and again, blow your cover.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em> provides a story example, where the party gets the bright idea that cheering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">Ashton</a> will help him to defeat a dragon. Instead, it eventually bugs him enough that he turns around and politely asks them to stop, which the injured dragon promptly capitalizes on and in an act of self-preservation, fuses itself with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Whoops.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni">Ni no Kuni</a></em> has some blatant explanations in its repertory, from telling you how to <strong>walk</strong>, to things like how to talk, open your inventory or what purpose does the minimap on the top right corner of the screen serves (hint: you can see your surroundings in it). Some of them are necessary but the big majority is plain outright obvious. It quickly becomes irritating, especially because they will pop up frequently for an hour into the game. Good thing they disappear shortly after that and that the hand-drawn sketches that come with them are pretty to look at (this last thing can be even more insulting to the player, as the game assumes you need the extra help of a sketch to grasp the concept of things like walking).
</li><li> Intentionally played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a></em> as a pre-order DLC. During the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Towelie</a> appears and gives the New Kid tips about the basics of the game as well as how to fight in certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">condition based battles</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After you beat him during one of those condition based boss fights later in the story, he continues to popup and give tips. Only he now does so while high off of the weed he sells and mostly talks nonsense</span>. Of course, if the player doesn't want to deal with him then they can turn him off in the options menu.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a> V: Beyond The Myth</em>, Necromancers' Wraiths and Rovers' Hawk and Hound can attack enemies, which does little damage but is still usually an acceptable supplement to your own party's attacks. Unfortunately, these attacks also wake up sleeping enemies, which means the sleep ailment is much more unreliable for any party containing these classes. Oh, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Eternal Tyrant, the final boss</span> is weak to sleep, so these "allies" will most likely deny you some precious opportunities to heal and reapply buffs during this difficult battle.

She also tells you if a missile is inbound when your HUD can do that in a less annoying fashion. Worst of all, she has the most annoying voice in the game. You can also change your operator, not that it matters.
</li><li> One of the more potentially derailing features of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em> is a "yes/no" answer input when your squadmates ask you questions. If you're say, <em>climbing in altitude as fast as possible to avoid being blown up by a heat seeking missile on your tail</em>, it can be quite annoying to suddenly have your squadmate pop in and casually ask if you want them to provide you with some cover. <strong>NO, REALLY, YOU THINK SO?!</strong> Unfortunately the game lacks a "no shit" response to questions of that nature. And despite the "squadron based" nature of the game, in actuality you usually end up doing 90% of the important stuff since your squadmates aren't smart enough to concentrate their fire on the <em>big fracking sub</em> that's firing one-hit kill missiles at you and instead insist on picking off the insignificant little targets instead no matter how often you hit ATTACK! or tell them what to do.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VivaPinata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VivaPinata">Viva Piñata</a></em>:
<ul><li> Leafos is your guide throughout the game, and starts out as being quite useful, giving you the tools you need to work the garden. As you level up, she congratulates you on your "improvement" in the way a nursery school teacher might praise a three-year-old's fingerpainting. Slightly annoying... in the "What right have <em>you</em> to comment, you were cowering in the house when thugs showed up and trashed your father's life's work" way. However, mild irritation isn't the last of it. Several species of pinata will fight if put in the same garden together. One solution, other than selling one of the warring parties or moving them to a different garden, is to build a fence. Which will probably need a gate. Which Leafos will wander through in her meanderings around the garden and <em>leave open.</em> The first you'll probably know of this is when the battle music alerts you to the fact that two of your pinata are kicking the living daylights out of each other. Call yourself an expert, Leafos? Any farmer or riding school instructor would <em>kill</em> you for leaving a gate open!
</li><li> She also has a tendency to <em>lie</em>. Considering that some of the rarer or more exotic pinatas require more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">obscure</a> and/or bizarre methods to obtain, unless forewarned a statement like "I heard you can turn a Pretztail into a Mallowolf if it eats a Doenut" can sound legitimate, when it's nothing but a bloody lie.
</li><li> Patch the doctor is annoying for a different reason. He heals your sick pinata (probably after they've gotten into a fight courtesy of Leafos). However, another character, Dastardos, will "euthanize" a sick animal if Patch doesn't make it in time. If both doctor and Dastardos appear at the same time though, Patch will <em>stop what he's doing</em> and let Dastardos kill your animal — right under the good doctor's nose. Feel free to beat Patch with your spade at this point; it's the least he deserves.

Sometimes their advice is good ("You don't have enough fire stations to keep the town safe" or "Some random person's house has come ablaze, ya better put it out"), but it's mostly them working at cross-purposes, telling you something you either already know or can't do anything about, and even if you <em>can</em> do something about it not a minute later they'll berate you for doing what they advised to do a short while ago

<ul><li> Several of the Codec contacts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> act like this, but 99% of the time you're allowed to ignore them if it's not vitally plot-related.

While you can skip it, they're so ridiculously long that this <em>still</em> takes longer than it did to actually listen to Mei Ling's proverbs in the previous game. If that's not enough, there are also many, many, <em>many</em> times where she just radios you up for the hell of it or butts into a conversation you're having with Colonel Campbell. It will get to the point where just hearing her say "Jack" will make you twitch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em>, you can shut Otacon up <em>and</em> cause him to almost have an aneurysm — in the 'Follow the Resistance member' segment of Act 3, it's possible to reduce Otacon to sputtering, angry silence by <em>shooting</em> the resistance members you encounter. Otacon starts off with a warning, then a sharper warning, then a pained cry of "Snake!?!", and finally, he just sputters and hangs up on the Codec. Beware, though — shoot too many of them and it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a>.
</li><li> Rose and Meryl aren't nearly as bad as the painfully useless radio cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>, though. Their roles are 1) tell you to call other people and not to bother him, or tell you he's changing his frequency again for absolutely no reason (the Colonel), 2) tell you that you have no chance to beat this game and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe">you might as well curl into a ball and die</a> (Kessler), 3) ramble at you about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpoSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpoSpeak">the number of species of pigeons that exist</a> (Norden), 4) complain that 'now isn't a good time' and refuse to help you (Holly), 5) talk to you about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">the ergonomics of video gaming</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">dispense useless military trivia</a> (Miller), and 6) deliver one of the first major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">death speeches</a> in the entire series (Gustava).

Also, towards the end, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">asks Snake out to have a cheese fondue dinner with him</a>, thus making himself the mandatory male-borderline-love-interest character of that <em>Metal Gear</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear</a></em> was much more straightforward with this: Diane would tell Snake which weapon worked best on each boss (provided that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">overprotective big brother</a> wasn't monitoring her call), Schneider would tell you the locations of many important items in the areas where you needed them, and Jennifer was important enough for being the only character who can provide the Rocket Launcher and Compass. The only dead weight was Big Boss himself, who only provides uselessly-obvious advice on items and weapons ("A Handgun? You know how to use it"). That was intentional, seeing as he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game and deliberately trying to screw you over so you'd fail.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> series makes extensive use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlePan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlePan">Puzzle Pan</a> during platform-jumping sequences. The trouble is that in some places, the camera tries to be a bit too helpful in angling itself to show you the intended pathway forward; as the directional controls are relative to the camera, not the character, it can very easily result in missed jumps.

<ul><li> Claire needs a pair of decorative Gold Lugers to open a door. When she finds them, she gets caught in a deathtrap — which resets when she puts them back. Later, Steve finds them and takes them, and refuses to let go, making Claire run to save him. To top it off, once she saves him he refuses to hand over the guns unless Claire gives him "something fully automatic" — which sends her on a wholly unnecessary fetch quest.
</li><li> When Claire actually finds the guns, it causes her and Steve to be dropped into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>'s trap. Steve then takes the guns and shoots about ten zombies, <em>a wall</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and his zombie dad.</span> He doesn't give you the automatic guns, and the Gold Lugers he does give you have no ammo.
</li><li> Steve finally manages to get the drop on and disarm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Alfred, and has him at gunpoint for about 30 seconds — but does not pull the trigger, because <em>he's freaked out about Alfred being a transvestite!</em> Not only that, but the pause gives Alfred time to run away and set the base's self-destruct mechanism. While Claire and Steve escape, Alfred is able to set the autopilot on their plane remotely, sending them to <em>Antarctica</em>.
</li><li> While in Antarctica, Steve messes up operating a drill, flooding the room they're in with toxic gas — because he was busy staring at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Claire's butt.</a> This sends Claire all over the complex to find a gas mask.
</li><li> After all that, Steve turns into a huge monster and tries to kill Claire, forcing her to use ammo and/or herbs to get away from him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which really should be used by Chris instead, since he's the one that has to kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Alexia.</span>

Aside from moments in the game that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaMan">tailor-fit to require two people</a> (like carrying a lantern or needing to hold a gate open), she's rarely useful and often a hindrance as she drains your ammo and curative items, and triggers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> if she dies. It's really telling that people actually made a <em>Solo Mod</em> not for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, but to put an end to her "help" and play the game in peace. Chris also counts if you play as Sheva in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperatorsSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperatorsSide">Lifeline</a></em>, where you <em>are</em> the helper telling an AI character what to do via a USB microphone. Unfortunately, voice recognition has never been a precise technology, and in getting Rio to do something you'll often end up repeating your instructions enough times to make Navi look like a mute. Also played straight, however, as Rio will repeatedly ask you for advice in a way that hints at what you have to advise her to do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em>. The game encourages the player to help the other survivors they find on the prison island. Shame the other survivors tend to crazily wound the player while trying to destroy monsters. Only one apologizes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> uses an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a> system of sorts in its spellcasting, with the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Ancients</a> each being strong against one and weak against another.. Just about <em>every</em> chapter in the game has a piece of scenery, such as a carving or a painting, which dictates how this cycle works. It's helpful at first, but by the time you're still seeing it in later chapters of the game, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> saying that its meaning "isn't readily apparent", you have to wonder how badly the game believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">Viewers Are Goldfish</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, you may have set up this lovely minefield to blow any zombies that come along into little chunks.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox1">Star Fox</a>:
<ul><li> If your wingmen go down, they don't "get better". And while you can beat the game on its hardest setting WITHOUT any wingmen, they do tend to help mop up some enemies you might miss, allowing you to pass more missions with 100% of enemies shot down (and earn more continues). And the noises they make indicating their mortal distress is just plain depressing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em>
<ul><li> You have Peppy randomly shouting "hints" like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoABarrelRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoABarrelRoll">Do a Barrel Roll</a>!" and "Try a somersault!" at you in the middle of battle which may be helpful on occasion but not at the frequency of those comments.
</li><li> Depending on which route you take in Sector X, Peppy may end up with enemies chasing him <em>twice</em>, and if you don't make it through the warp gate, Slippy jumps in shortly after the boss hits half of maximum HP and immediately gets knocked flying into the desert planet unless you can take out that other half <em>really</em> quickly. On the "positive" side, the necessity of this plot point means you get Slippy <em>back</em> at the end of the level if you lost him on Katina/Fortuna or earlier in Sector X.
</li><li> In Sector Z, your wingmen will attempt to destroy the missiles for you, impairing getting the medal. Each of the six missiles is a major source of points, at 11 points each, and you don't get credit for missiles that are destroyed by your wingmen. If it weren't for the requirement that all of your wingmen be alive to get the medal, you'd be wishing for them to be dead.
</li></ul></li><li> Prince Tricky from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em> was doubly annoying in that you only need him to dig up stuff and to light stuff on fire, which he needs special blue mushrooms for. When he is low on food, he will constantly complain about how hungry he is. And then when you are trying to avoid some enemies, he will helpfully chime in with "BAD GUY!" and "COOOOOOOLLLLL!" And if you tried to vent your frustration by hitting him, he breathed fire on you.
</li></ul></li><li> The tendency of idiotic AIs to spout meaningless "helpful" hints is spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a>. Melee</em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Slippy:</strong> Hold A to charge up shots! <br/><strong>Peppy:</strong> Cut your way though with a boost! <br/><strong>Fox:</strong> Aren't you guys thinking of something else?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> has this in the form of the Squid Sisters. The Squid Sisters show up in an unskippable cutscene whenever you turn on the game to alert you what stages are currently in rotation. They also do this every four hours, when the maps switch in the rotation. Funny dialogue aside, these scenes are both unskippable and useless: your Wii U Gamepad also has this information, in addition to telling you what ranked battle mode is currently in play, something that the Squid Sisters fail to inform you. Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> with Off the Hook, who only interrupt you when you first turn on the game.
<ul><li> Sheldon from the game's weapon shop has similarly unskippable cutscenes, explaining the use of any new weapons you unlock. This becomes a problem if you haven't been to the shop in a long time, and end up with a lot of new weapons available: Sheldon will make you sit there while he explains the uses of ALL OF THEM. Thankfully, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> gives you the option to skip through his dialogue automatically at the push of a button.

<ul><li> Her attacks with a weak bow that only inconveniences the majority of your foes, has a very low firing rate, and is extremely liable to shoot you in the back (and when that happens, the arrows take out a significant chunk of your health bar). Lampshaded in dialog by the Prince:
<div class="indent"><strong>Farah:</strong> <em>[after Farah has accidentally shot the Prince during a previous fight]</em> You go ahead. I'll cover you. <br/><strong>Prince:</strong> Please don't. You're liable to hit me.
</div></li><li> Also, in the opening, where she shouts "useful" tips that replay, after one time:
<div class="indent"><strong>Prince:</strong> <em>I know!</em> You already said that! <br/><strong>Farah:</strong> No, I didn't!

You know this because the Prince <em>will not stop saying</em> "Elika! The throne! Elika! The throne! Elika! The throne!"

<ul><li> The entire movie cast has moments of this. The 'busters never truly die if at least one is still standing and are capable of reviving each other if need be. Unfortunately, your teammates are incompetent and take their sweet time to walk over and save anyone, meaning that <em>you</em> will be forced to spend most of your time in tough missions running around and reviving everyone or risk quick death.
</li><li> The shouted advice can be nifty at times if you haven't already checked Tobin's or used your PKE meter/goggles, but damn does it get annoying to hear the same advice being shouted to you when you've already been making use of that same advice for some time or already thought of it long before they started hollering it to you. Or when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is spewing slime or other dangerous substances at you and you simply <em>can't</em> stand around in one place for too long lest you die.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deadlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deadlock">Deadlock</a> 2</em> defaults to giving you a status report every turn filled with absolutely useless information. And whenever a status report appears, your advisor springs up and says useful things like "Everything is going fine", or "Something happened", or "Hey, look at this", or a thousand of similarly useless messages. Mercifully, an option is available to restrict status reports to appear when something actually worth of note happens, which reduces them drastically, but when they do appear the advisor is still there.
</li><li> In the tactical turn based game <em>Frontline Tactics</em>, any solder set on 'Overwatch' fires if an enemy takes an action in his line of sight. MGs have a cone of fire, so hit not only the target, but those standing nearby. A medic healing a comrade is enough to trigger the overwatch fire, hitting not only the medic, but also the man he was tending, often for double the number of Hit Points he had healed.
</li><li> An update to the single-player mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Magicka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Magicka">Magicka</a></em> added an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> who, as a parody of Navi, would often interrupt with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish">"Ey! Lisna!"</a> and caption pointing out the blindingly obvious. Her actual purpose is to revive you if you die, since you have no teammates to take care of that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The three paladins that escort Princess Raquesis during her introductory chapter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> will rush out to defend the princess and get themselves killed, even if it's usually more advantageous to wait for the threat to come closer before acting.
</li><li> Chapter 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em> gives you three AI allies that start a good distance ahead of your party, and hits you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> if any of them die. Two of them are frail and all too often will prioritize killing enemies over staying safe and healing, while the third - who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> and who you <em>want</em> attacking enemies - instead does what the other two should be doing. Especially on Hard Mode, it's not only possible but <em>frequent</em> for you to lose without any sort of actual player input.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, it's quite possible for a character to be killed entirely because of the assistance of another character, because it means that an enemy is killed by a counterattack that would otherwise have left it alive, freeing up that space for another enemy to come in for a finishing blow.
</li><li> Neutral units across the series tend to be this. They count as "Ally" units and are supposedly there to help the player's army. Only, the vast majority of the time, they're <em>horribly</em> under-leveled for the map they're on, so the Ally Phase will generally be spent watching them suicidally charge into the enemy and slowly die, taking up a lot of time. And in the event that they <em>do</em> manage to get kills, they'll just steal the EXP from defeating the enemy units (when EXP is usually quite limited in <em>Fire Emblem</em>). And if the enemy they killed had an item they would've dropped? Well, now said item is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost forever to you</a>, all due to the ally's "help."

When you answer him, Frank becomes incapable of fighting or even jumping until the call is over, and will also automatically drop any weapon that is too big to store in your inventory. And if you hang up on him, he calls you again, complains "Don't hang up on me like that! That's rude!" and <em>restarts his entire speech from the beginning</em>! <em>VG Cats</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=204">explains it with style<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as does <a class="urllink" href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/otis-rising.php">Something Awful<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Otis was made even worse by the 360's controller. If you didn't press the D-pad <em>just</em> right, you could drop your weapon or bring up an in-game menu.

Every once in a while, one of the villains sends minions on drug runs from San Fierro to Los Santos, and you are able to intercept them and steal their money. It wouldn't be so bad except that when it happens, the phone rings, CJ automatically answers it, and the following conversation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">has become ingrained in many a player's head</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>CJ:</strong> Hey Cesar. The yay leavin' San Fierro, right? <br/><strong>Cesar:</strong> Right, but they're using <em>bikes</em>, CJ, and they go <em>cross-country</em>!

LJT assists with the businesses added in the Bikers update, which is is all well and good. Where the annoying part comes into play is that LJT will <em>constantly</em> update the player on the statuses of the these said businesses, almost always making several back to back calls to update you on the status of each business. Its gotten to the point that many people recommend shutting the businesses you have so as to avoid LJT altogether.

<ul><li> After the player rebuilds X-PO, he develops a tendency to snark at the player, while covering the bottom of the screen with pop-ups that remind him/her which Adventure World and/or Level each character on the Toy Pad unlocks. For players who don't have trouble remembering this info, this habit could become obnoxious. Players who frequently hit the Hint Stones have to hear X-PO's snarks even more often, as he delivers one while the hint appears. (These pop-ups and hints also appear before the player rebuilds X-PO, but with no audio accompaniment, and a question mark where his picture later shows up.)
</li><li> Also, in the Sonic The Hedgehog level pack, there's Omochao as an in-universe example. He constantly gives Sonic hints... which are things that should be obvious. Sonic takes the opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snark</a> at Omochao for this.

<ul><li> The guide NPC who functions as a newbie hint guide. Unfortunately, he likes to path around the players and can enter their normally safe houses, bringing the monsters howling at the doors inside with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> running from monsters who have gotten into their homes can also run to your house and open the door that kept them out.
</li><li> The baby slime summoned from the rare Slime Staff. It has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAllyImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAllyImmortality">Gameplay Ally Immortality</a> and hits rather fast and can kill weaker enemies quickly. Unfortunately it can also negate your attacks due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> the mobs have while being pummeled by the slime, thus your attacks don't always register. During hardmode, it quickly becomes obsolete due to its low attack power, and the higher defense hardmode monsters have. By that point you'll probably be better off killing things on your own rather than rely on the slime.
</li><li> Some summons in general can end up being this, especially the fast attacking ones like the Stardust Dragon. They can constantly trigger enemies' and bosses' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> which will leave you no room to get any hits in for yourself, which in turn can drastically lower your damage.

Only they can't aim, they're pretty weak, and they don't show up in enough numbers to threaten the usual enemy response. Oh, and if they die, you take a morale hit.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> has a tendency to respond to slowly-loading videos by reducing the quality automatically. This can be a problem for those who prefer higher quality video, or specifically need it; software tutorials get hit particularly hard, with the menu options shown often being <strong>indecipherable at lower qualities</strong>. People who object to YouTube doing this will respond by putting the quality back up again, taking up more time than it would have if YouTube had simply left the video alone. Even worse is that sometimes YouTube will <em>lock off the higher quality option</em> when it does this, forcing the user to refresh the page, and taking up even more time. Particularly nasty is how YouTube gives an option to never play high-quality video to improve load times... but no option to never play low-quality video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Showdown, a website used to simulate competitive Pokémon battling, has a few tools to help beginners be as competitive as reasonably possible. It lists Pokémon by tier, moves by how viable they are on the Pokémon in question, and optimal EV spreads based on the Pokémon's stats and moves. While this is all well and good in theory, it's mostly automatically generated and a few Pokémon can really screw up how it's built. For an example, Magmortar is very notorious among the RU crowd for this reason; it needs high Speed to function with any real degree of success, but the automated EV generator will almost invariably give it high HP at the expense of Speed. It's also based on the assumption that players will be using maximum-level Pokémon, meaning that players of Little Cup (a spinoff metagame where all legal Pokemon are at level 5) can sometimes encounter hilarious results like <a class="urllink" href="http://i941.photobucket.com/albums/ad256/Malkyrian/suggested.png">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4usxj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4usxj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4usxj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">255 is the maximum number of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EVs">E Vs</a> legal in any one stat, and negative <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EVs">E Vs</a> are never possible.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google">Google</a> will sometimes detect what it thinks are misspelled search terms.
<ul><li> Sometimes, it will suggest what it believes to be a corrected query, but otherwise let you browse results with what you typed in ("Did you mean..."), but other times, it will automatically show results for the altered terms either alongside your exact terms ("Including results for...") or <em>instead</em> of them ("Showing results for..."), with a link to search only for your exact words. And <em>other</em> times, you won't even be given the option to un-correct your query and have to surround your words with quotation marks to signal "no, Google, don't correct these damn terms" - and sometimes after going through this, Google will completely ignore you anyway ("No results found for <em>(insert intended search)</em>. Results for...") This can be a problem with proper nouns (which most spelling correction software will not recognize unless they're common names) and very technical terms that are unlikely to be included in most general-purpose dictionaries.
</li><li> Google Chrome gets in on it as well. There is an option, defaulting to on, to get search strings suggested in the URL bar whenever you type something into it that isn't a URL - and unless you're using the mobile version on a smartphone, there is <em>zero</em> middle ground between turning the option off entirely and having the search suggestions completely crowd out actual URLs for websites you've previously visited and are trying to go to again.
</li><li> For Chrome (as well as every other Chromium-based browser), the URL bar has autocomplete, and it cannot be disabled. Search for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>, for example, and you will now have to press Backspace whenever you just want to search for "Super Mario", because it will fill in "Odyssey" automatically for you every single time. Very annoying. Plenty of users have requested an option to turn the damn thing off, but Google has responded that <a class="urllink" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91378">they will never add such an option<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of Medical, Health, and Fitness websites have a thing now where if you trying look up information from a search engine on a certain helpful subject and try to read the article on a website talking about that subject, a popup will occur, trying to get you to sign up for their website as a member. Most websites, however, have an option that lets you surpass the popup, such as: "Remind Me Later", "Not At This Time", etc. However, the most annoying websites <em>won't</em> let you view their articles useless you sign up to their website first.
</li><li> Some websites sell words, which means that more or less random words in the article will be highlighted as links to paid content. This isn't so bad if you actually have to click on the link. Horrible if just accidentally moving the mouse pointer across one results in a popup. Guess which type is more common?
