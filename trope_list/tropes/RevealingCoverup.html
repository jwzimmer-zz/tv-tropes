<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>
<ul><li> Light's murder of Naomi Misora <em>almost</em> worked as intended, but ultimately just alerted L that there was a good chance that Kira was one of the people that her fiancé had been investigating.
</li><li> Light's decision to kill the fake L appearing on television not only failed to catch the real target but revealed both his general location and the fact that he killed by supernatural means.
</li><li> Once L began investigating him and started putting pressure on his mass murder schedule, Light killed people in even higher measures each day, as if to contradict his adversary's hypothesis (he reacted to something that should have prompted no change were he not Kira by killing excessively). He tells Ryuk that this was supposed to make L investigate the police, which would make them resent L and investigate him as well, and find his real name. Ryuk has a good laugh at his expense.
</li><li> When Light realizes L has tapped his room, Light executes an extremely elaborate plan to look innocent with L as his witness. Light appearing perfectly innocent while criminals he should have no way of learning about die, but relatively minor criminals compared to Kira's usual targets, only seems to make L more suspicious.
</li></ul></li><li> Used to extreme effect in the eleventh volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a>.</em> The killer followed Kindaichi throughout the two-parter mystery, killing people after they provided messages which were supposed to lead to a manuscript he wanted to keep from being published. What neither the killer nor Kindaichi realizes until after the last message was a dead end is that the message itself was irrelevant. The real clue was hidden in the order of the now-dead message givers. Because of the murders meant to silence them, the newspaper following the last murder would inevitably print them in order of killing, providing the same clue to <em>everyone</em> who read the paper, guaranteeing <em>someone</em> would figure it out before the killer could and prompting a desperate grasping of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, the denizens of Punk Hazard try to trick Smoker out of investigating their island by putting out toxic gas. The idea was to make him think it was still uninhabitable after a prior accident. Unfortunately, Smoker knows the history of that island and this only makes him <em>more</em> suspicious, because there shouldn't be <em>this much</em> gas after all this time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maverick</span> decides the best way to keep Kotetsu from revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jake didn't kill Barnaby's parents</span> is to frame him for murder, alter the memories of everyone working at Hero TV and knowing he's the Hero Wild Tiger, erase his job records and phone number, and seal the records about Wild Tiger so that the other Heroes would arrest him or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Lunatic</a> would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteExecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteExecution">burn him to death as he does with murderers</a>...

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a> conspiracy graphic novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FromHell">From Hell</a></em>, and the real-life Prince Albert Victor-centric conspiracy theory it dramatizes, hinges on the monarch of the world's most powerful nation being so threatened by the possibility of unsubstantiated (though true) allegations from four London prostitutes that she has them all murdered. Not only murdered but killed in such a needlessly elaborate and gruesome way that it inevitably attracts the attention of half the country, never mind the obsessive detective. Though Victoria only wanted the situation quietly taken care of. It was her bad luck that the man she picked to do it turned out to be an increasingly insane psychopath who insisted on mutilating the bodies in an ever more shocking and attention-drawing fashion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> When villains Blockhouse and Jolt kidnap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>, they cover the inner walls of their hideout with lead, so Superman cannot find them with his x-ray vision. However, the lead covering makes the building stick out like a sore thumb to Superman, since it was the <em>only</em> thing he couldn't see through. This isn't the only time criminals try the trick and have it backfire on them.
</li><li> In another case involving Superman, a group of crooks was running a scam with one pretending to be the Man of Steel and asking for money to guard various valuables. This attracts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a>'s attention, as not only did the fake Supes fail to recognize him, but also he was aware that Superman would never ask for money for his services. The scam attracts further suspicion when Jimmy attacks and is easily able to give the fake Superman trouble, causing the crook to yell for his partners to shoot him "before he ruins everything!" A little late for that...
</li></ul></li><li> In a Silver Age story, Nasthalthia 'Nasty' Luthor sets in motion a bullying campaign to cover up her uncle Lex's latest ploy to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> as luring the Girl of Steel out. Her bullying spree indeed drew Supergirl's attention... so she spied on Nasty and found out about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>'s whole scheme.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> storyline "Blind Justice", an investment banker who thinks his favorite employee may have overheard his unsavory business dealings has him arbitrarily fired so he won't be a target. This is a revealing cover-up <em>twice</em>; it attracts his criminal associates' attention to the employee, which is exactly what he wanted to avoid, and the employee himself goes straight to Matt Murdock to talk about a wrongful dismissal suit.
</li><li> Defied (although even then it requires explanation) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em>: in a flashback to one of Herr Starr's first assignments for the conspiracy he works for he was asked to get rid of two reporters that the conspiracy had locked up in an insane asylum for getting too close to the truth in a way that doesn't lead back to them. Starr <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">sets the entire asylum on fire</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThemAll">killing everyone inside, reporters included</a>. When his baffled and irate higher-ups ask why the hell he did that, Starr explains that killing just the reporters would have probably provided proof that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>, but killing <em>everybody</em> makes it impossible to discern who was the target, or even if there <em>was</em> a target, and may probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">be dismissed as an accident</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Starr's superiors acknowledge that he has a point.</a>

The heroes discover the location by looking up aerial survey photos and finding one page with a huge blank spot, as the photographer "forgot" to take that picture.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, Klara first came to the Runaways' attention when they stopped a fire in a factory where she happened to be working. Afraid that they were one of the two gangs that were hunting for people with superpowers, she fled the scene via a hole in the back of the factory, rather than going out through the front with the other children who'd been caught in the fire. Had she gone through the front with the rest, nobody would have paid attention to her, but her attempts to hide attracted Karolina's attention, leading her to discover Klara's horrible home life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinKingOttokarsSceptre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinKingOttokarsSceptre">King Ottokar's Sceptre</a></em>, Tintin wasn't suspicious of anything until the Syldavian conspirators got suspicious of him. Had they just let him be, their plan would have succeeded.

As a result, scrying no longer works on her. Furthermore, due to the high percentage of the Light-affiliated mages distracted by the battle, Ami's Lightworlder allies immediately suspect something. Ami, of course, didn't intend this at all. However, in light of her reputation as a class-one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, she decides correcting them to be more trouble than it's worth.

</li><li> Similar to the above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shooter">Shooter</a></em> is about a sniper who is set up as the fall guy for a failed presidential assassination. It turns out that the senator who funded the job was joking about killing the president — it was the African ambassador next to him that was a serious threat. As the real killer puts it, "What better way to kill a man in plain sight of one million Americans than by shooting him right next to the president?" By the end of the movie, the sniper successfully uncovers the mass murder of third world tribes for oil pipelines to the Secretary of Defense, but the senator is too high up / the crime is foreign so it isn't in American jurisdiction. So said sniper just kills them all. And ironically covers it up so that the senator's hitman looks like the shooter. Agent Nick Memphis smells fish when he sees the forensic report on the shooting back within a few hours "We're the federal government, we aren't that good at our job" and also when the police officer who got a shot at the alleged-would-be assassin of the President dies a few days later in a "botched robbery".
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sniper">Sniper</a> 3</em>, the sniper's mission to kill an old war buddy turned Vietnamese drug lord/rogue intelligence agent is interrupted by a second sniper trying to kill <em>him</em>. This is due to the fact that said drug lord is one of three people who had participated in a war crime in Vietnam, the other two being the NSA director and a powerful senator, and they wanted him dead to protect themselves, and kill the killer to ensure that the sniper didn't learn why. Given that they had destroyed all physical evidence of their crimes thirty years earlier, the only reason why it gets discovered is that they tried to cover it up.

After waking up in a hospital, Harris finds that his wife and colleagues don't recognize him anymore — and his wife is with some <em>other</em> guy claiming to be Dr. Martin Harris. The first Harris doesn't believe this, but all evidence points to him <em>not</em> being who he thinks he is. He returns to the hospital, prepared to accept that he really has gone crazy... and then an assassin comes to kill him. Harris escapes, now knowing that there really is a conspiracy, and tears the entire thing down.

For example, if someone apparently dies (only to show up again many issues later), and an article describes it as "her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">apparent</span> death"... there are very few words that would fit into that spot, and most of them indicate that the person's still around in some sense. So unless we all get into the habit of saying "her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">real, permanent, not a dream, not a robot, not an imaginary story!</span> death", it's probably best to stick the spoiler at the end, where it could mean any number of things, including things that happened to someone else entirely.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2moie');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2moie" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2moie');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This can also happen on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> and other Wikis when a work's synopsis says someone 'apparently' dies.

<ul><li> That there was a cover-up at all may actually constitute evidence of guilt, in some cases. If a statute requires that an action was taken "with corrupt intent", or that it was undertaken "knowingly", the defendant's counsel might argue that they did not have the necessary intent or knowledge. If, however, the defendant took part in any action to conceal the first crime, then that itself may be construed as being evidence of that intent or knowledge. It's hard to argue that you didn't know you were doing anything wrong if you got caught trying to prevent that wrongdoing from ever being discovered.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3aq8p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3aq8p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3aq8p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin">Gratuitous Latin</a>, the secondary <em>actus reus</em> confirming the <em>mens rea</em> of the primary crime.</span>
</li><li> Theres a saying in politics: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. Often in a scandal, the only actual convictions that result come from the cover-up rather than the crime itself. Partly this is because, in the United States, obstruction of justice laws are so broad that they can be interpreted to cover almost anything. Sometimes it's because the real evidence was successfully destroyed by the cover-up, and so the only evidence left is <em>for</em> the cover-up. Finally, when confronting a defendant who they feel is guilty but without enough evidence to convict, a jury will search for some lesser charge like obstruction to nail them on. Also, the original crime may have been committed by a relatively junior member of an important persons staff, without the bosss explicit knowledge. If this comes out, it will be embarrassing for the boss but probably survivable. However, as it starts to come out, the problem is escalated to the top of the organisation  which means that the boss <em>does</em> have knowledge of any attempted cover-up.
<ul><li> Martha Stewart was found guilty of concealing evidence that she'd engaged in insider trading, but not of actual insider trading itself. Due to a quirk in American legal law, the prosecution couldn't <em>quite</em> prove that what she had done fit the definition of insider trading, but they could absolutely prove that she'd been lying about it and was trying to cover it up.
</li><li> Bill Clinton was impeached over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. However, while tacky and morally reprehensible, cheating on one's spouse isn't actually illegal in America, even for politicians. Instead, Clinton was indicted over perjuring himself by lying to a grand jury to cover-up said affair. His defenders argued that the "crime" itself was so silly that the cover-up shouldn't be prosecutable, while his detractors said that Clinton still broke the law by lying about it, even if it was a silly crime.

</li><li> An incompetent version of this was behind the whole Roswell mystery. When a rancher discovered some strange debris on his property, the top brass realized that it was actually a balloon from a secret government project called Project Mogul (the balloons were supposed to be an early-warning system in the event of a nuclear strike). Since Project Mogul was top secret, the government quickly confiscated the debris and ordered a press conference denying that it was anything but a weather balloon. Sometime after that, word got out that the weather balloon story was a cover-up. Project Mogul was still classified, so they could only confirm that yes, the weather balloon story was a cover-up, and no, they couldn't disclose what it <em>was</em> covering up. Bear in mind that this was the height of UFO sightings in the USA, and you have the explanation from how things went from "a few plastic strips and metal rods found on a ranch" to "OMG ALIENS!!!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4x559');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4x559" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4x559');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Notice, however, that nobody thought "OMG SECRET AIR FORCE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM", so the cover-up <em>worked</em>.</span> The notoriety of the Incident also stems from the fact that the first cover story used actually <em>was</em> "we've captured a flying saucer." (This lasted for about a day, and was the brainchild of a foolhardy local PR officer.) The replacement "weather balloon" cover passed without notice for decades; it was only in the 1970s (once eyewitnesses became conveniently hard to locate) that UFO enthusiasts could latch onto the original cover story as a "smoking gun" and build an entertaining conspiracy theory out of it.

Scarily, <em>5,000</em> of the organization's agents <em>penetrated the IRS, FBI and other US government organizations</em>, the largest such infiltration in history, and did manage to abscond with the "erroneous" documents. Two Scientologists were caught essentially red-handed by the FBI, and from there the whole plot unraveled and ended up with several prominent Scientologists getting hefty fines or prison sentences, including L. Ron Hubbard's wife. The resultant publicity caused a backlash against the Church and indirectly led to its banning in several countries.

<ul><li> Specifically, the Soviet nuclear scientist Georgy Flyorov stumbled upon this by accident. He had written a paper on spontaneous nuclear fission that was nominated for a Stalin Prize but rejected because western scientists had taken no notice of it even though he published an article in <em>Physical Review</em>. Peeved, Flyorov leafed through U.S. physical journals in search of a review of his work when he noticed that not only was there none, but there were no articles at all about nuclear fission. This led him to the conclusion that the (at first still neutral) American government had made the matter a state secret because it was working on producing a nuclear bomb. However, it actually was a subversion, as American physicists had decided among themselves in April 1940 (about a year before the launch of the atom bomb program) to stop publishing anything pertaining to nuclear fission in order not to give anything away that might help the Germans build a nuclear bomb.
</li><li> Averted when sci-fi writer Cleve Cartmill wrote a short story called "Deadline" that described how to build a uranium-fission bomb; it was published in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">March 1944</a> issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Analog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Analog">Astounding Science Fiction</a></em>. The FBI demanded the issue be removed from the newsstands, but <em>Astounding</em> editor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWCampbell">John W. Campbell</a> convinced them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">this would only draw unwanted attention</a>.
</li><li> A similar aversion occurred with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em>, as the model B-52 bomber was <em>so</em> accurate that the military initially wanted it altered until someone pointed out that doing so would run afoul of this trope.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note57xkj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note57xkj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note57xkj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The filmmakers and the B-52's designers had, independently of each other, used a copy of the unclassified B-29 layout modified to fit the different cockpit shape.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> One of the first things arson and police investigators look for in the case of fires that have had fatalities is evidence the victims were dead first and the fire used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryCoverup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryCoverup">hide that fact</a>.
</li><li> This fact has saved several journalists that have speculated on classified information. In 1944, a crossword puzzle in a London newspaper coincidentally used several codewords for the upcoming Normandy landings and massive deception campaign. It turned out that the author had no idea that he was using the codewords, but nothing was done as doing anything would draw attention to it. It was later revealed that his students had overheard the words being used around military camps and presented them to him. Similarly, though in a less innocent case, Col. Robert R. McCormick, the isolationist publisher of the Chicago Tribune, speculated that the US had broken Japanese codes and was left alone so to avoid drawing attention.
</li><li> One theory regarding John Muhammad, the DC Beltway Sniper, was that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillingsSpecificTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillingsSpecificTarget">random killings were a setup</a> so he could eventually kill his ex-wife in the same manner, knowing that he could avoid the usual suspicion of the ex-husband if she were believed to be a random victim. Due to the massive media coverage of the case, he was caught before executing this plan.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair">The Dreyfus affair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started as a bad investigation and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">worse trial</a> sending an innocent man to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Hellhole Prison</a>. When the errors were being unravelled step by step, the perpetrators choose to defend the initial error and the real perpetrator by more and more lies and outright forgery, ending with a grotesque anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about a "Jewish syndicate". It didn't work.
</li><li> Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert's sexual abuse scandal came to light after federal investigators looked into his illegally structuring hush money payments to his victims to avoid his bank reporting large transactions to the government as required by law.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note629ci');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note629ci" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note629ci');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The law in the US requires that a currency (i.e. cash) transaction of $10,000 or more must be reported by the financial institution using a tool called a Currency Transaction Report (CTR). However, if there are repeated transactions that don't seem to make sense, or are designed to avoid a CTR, such as withdrawals for $9,900, the financial institution <em>still</em> reports it as suspicious activity, so Hastert was caught no matter what he did.</span> Incidentally, this provision was part of the PATRIOT Act, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">a law he had championed.</a>
</li><li> Border control agencies become highly suspicious of packages being sent over the border, either through the postal service or by being carried by passengers, the second they see carbon paper. This is due to an urban myth that carbon paper absorbs X-rays and makes whatever is hidden within invisible to X-ray machines. Criminals attempting to smuggle drugs this way only end up giving themselves away.
<ul><li> Likewise with any effort to throw drug-sniffing dogs off by concealing the contraband in something seemingly "innocent" like coffee grounds or peanut butter; dogs are trained to discreetly alert on those smells, particularly when they smell them in places that no one would expect to smell them like a car's front grille.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection">Copy Protection</a> for games often involves deliberately introducing errors on a disc in specific places. When the game is run, it checks for these errors, which the operating system's copy function will skip over. When the copy is run, the game will notice that there's no error and it's not running off the original disc. There are ways to make exact "bit-for-bit" copies that will fool naive copy protection schemes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s administration over the United States government:
<ul><li> During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen paid at least two women not to reveal their sexual relationships with Trump. It was already public knowledge that Trump had previously engaged in extra-marital sex and it had little impact on his support, even among evangelicals, whom one would expect to be most bothered by it. An ongoing investigation of this and other matters related to the Trump campaign has, as of February 2019, led to at least three dozen people being indicted with several of them, including Cohen, becoming witnesses for the investigation. To make matters worse, it also prompted investigation into many <em>other</em> aspects of Trump's life, such as his charitable organization, his business, and his family, on the grounds that Trump's repeated denials about the payoff through Cohen implied he was lying about everything else as well.
</li><li> In June 2019, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts">the Supreme Court</a> ruled against the Trump administrations proposed question about citizenship in the 2020 census for this reason. The reason for adding the question, according to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, was that they wanted to enforce the Voting Rights Act better, a motive seen as highly implausible at best. Turns out that a Republican operative named Thomas Hofeller had done a study in 2015 in which he discovered the citizenship question would help Republicans keep majority standing in the U.S. House and more state legislatures in future elections. Essentially, counting by citizenship, not total population, would benefit rural, white places whose voters vote more Republican over diverse, urban places whose voters vote more Democratic.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note77vf4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note77vf4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note77vf4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Constitution contains a requirement for a census every ten years, and refers simply to "Persons" to be counted, without distinguishing between citizens, legally-resident non-citizens, or immigrants.</span> It would also stop Republican bleeding in transitioning states with large populations of immigrants like Texas and Georgia. However, Hofeller didnt destroy his hard drives before he passed away in August 2018 and his daughter found his communications about the VRA coverup story as well as the hard data. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the citizenship question was not necessarily inherently problematic but that the sloppy inclusion and cover-up called for the executive branch to clear up its story. The Trump administration announced the next week that they wouldnt defend the case at the circuit level and that they would print the forms without the question. It also seems many administration officials, including Ross, lied about the question while under oath. For instance, the Administration's official story was that the Commerce Department requested the question, while in actuality the Administration had already decided to add the question and had contacted Ross to provide some sort of justification after the fact.
</li></ul></li><li> As a rule of thumb, whenever you see an article with a headline ending in a question mark (e.g., "Is Bob a pedophile?"), it's probably not true, as if the writer/publisher/editor had proof, they would simply say it. Phrasing it as a question is all done so they (probably) can't be sued for libel if it turns out to be false (or they are just making the whole thing up). It's most commonly known today as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge's law of headlines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after British technology writer Ian Betteridge, who wrote about it in <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090226202006/http://www.technovia.co.uk/2009/02/techcrunch-irresponsible-journalism.html">a 2009 story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
