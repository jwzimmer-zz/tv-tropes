In fact, truthfulness is not guaranteed by the use of such drugs; while a person under the influence of a truth serum may become talkative, or may experience reduced inhibitions or even hallucinogenic fantasies, they are still quite capable of lying.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cixu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0cixu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cixu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The idea is to hopefully get them to run their mouth and blurt out what you want to know before their brain catches up again.</span> For this reason, and the obvious human and civil rights issues (which are similar to those regarding torture), any statements obtained in this manner are inadmissible in court. Or, they're really disgusting concoctions used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InitiationCeremony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InitiationCeremony">crossing the line ceremonies</a>.

</p><p>In fiction, truth serums of all forms (be they actual drugs, spells or whatever) behave quite predictably, and will invariably have one or more of the following effects on the subject:
</p><p></p><ol><li> A person becomes incapable of lying, though still fully conscious and otherwise able.
</li><li> In many cases, the subject seems compelled to not only tell the truth but to talk, period. Simply shutting up and not speaking, which isn't a lie, never occurs to them — or, if they do try to shut up, they are physically unable to do so.
</li><li> As well, they have a tendency to go into far more detail than is necessary, when short, curt responses that aren't lies could still keep the secret. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllNeverTellYouWhatImTellingYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllNeverTellYouWhatImTellingYou">I'll Never Tell You What I'm Telling You!</a>
</li><li> Occasionally, they will be unable to lie, but quite able to be creative in telling the truth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">From a Certain Point of View</a>.
</li><li> A victim almost always gives complete and accurate information, even though in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, people who think they're telling the truth are often wrong.

<ul><li> Perhaps the most famous example is Wonder Woman's magic lasso, which forces others to tell her exactly what she wants to know. Originally it was portrayed without such powers, with the assumption <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">an Amazon with her foot on your neck was a compelling enough tactic</a>. The lasso was originally stated to have the power of forcing anyone bound in it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">obey Wonder Woman's orders</a>. This was written out, partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">it made things too easy for her</a>. The lasso is supposed to make you tell the truth; whether or not it forces you to speak at all is unclear.

</li><li> Subverted another time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s henchmen gave him some truth serum in order to get him to tell them where he kept his money.

<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> kidnaps a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">depowered</a> Clark Kent and gives him an experimental truth serum which his scientists explain is a synthetic recreation of Wonder Woman's magic lasso (See above). He then asks Clark, who broke the story about new hero Supernova, why it is that Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">is toying with Luthor by pretending to be someone else</a>. Clark, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">laughing madly</a>, informs Lex that he does not know who is under the Supernova mask, but he is absolutely certain of one thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">that it is not Superman</a>. Creator commentary in the trade-paperbacks points out that this scene, and perhaps the entire future path of DC comics, could have gone so differently if Luthor had simply known to ask <em>the right question</em>.
</li><li> Before that, soon after his wedding with Lois (when he was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">depowered</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">he was kidnapped</a> by a gangster, beaten up and drugged with a truth serum. He <em>told them</em> he was Superman, but the gangster <em>refused to believe</em> and thought the serum wasn't working. Somewhat justified, as Clark, depowered, had several hematomas and was bleeding, something Superman isn't supposed to do.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em> story <em>Flight 714</em>, Laszlo Carreidas is injected with a truth serum to try and pry the number of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissBankAccount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissBankAccount">Swiss Bank Account</a> from him. He, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenConfession">starts confessing to every misdeed he has ever done in his life</a>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Rastapopoulos is accidentally injected with the same serum, he and Carreidas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamToHamCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamToHamCombat">get into an argument</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">who is the evilest</a>.

When the subject repeated it, Diabolik misunderstood and inserted the sequence only once and got caged).

Inducing honesty is not actually its primary effect, though: what it does is make the subject <em>want to be helpful</em>, allowing the interrogator to suggest that it would be helpful if they would answer a few questions. The distinction is illustrated in <em>Ethan of Athos</em>, in a sequence where fast-penta is used to interrogate a character who is actually entirely ignorant of the subject at issue; instead of explaining that he can't understand the questions, let alone answer them, he attempts to help out by tacitly translating them into questions he <em>can</em> answer and answering those instead, to the confusion of his captors.
<ul><li> However, as fast-penta is a drug, not everyone reacts the same way. Most exceptions are fatal allergies. People whose work involves sensitive or classified information can have the allergy artificially induced unless their lives are deemed more important than the secrets they know. Bujold often uses artificial allergies to keep the characters from learning too much too soon. Another exception to the norm is Miles Vorkosigan. Due to his screwed up body chemistry, fast-penta induces a temporary mania in addition to the typical long-windedness. He uses this to his advantage, forcing himself to be discursive and bouncing off the walls reciting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Richard III</a></em> until his interrogators give up and put him back in his cell (And he still doesn't shut up until he finishes reciting the entire play, to his cellmate's discomfort).
</li><li> Fast-penta also removes its subject's inhibitions, making them voice whatever is on their mind. So when Ekaterin is under fast-penta, she talks about her sexual curiosity about Miles, to his embarrassment.

With some difficulty, he manages to keep his cover story straight. The aliens don't know this, so they believe his story that he's an innocent civilian and let him go.
<ul><li> This may be an illustration of what happens when you try to use truth drugs in real life—they work by lowering inhibitions (which sometimes helps), not by creating some kind of magical compulsive honesty.
</li><li> The fact that it was originally designed for use on aliens with reptilian/dinosaurian physiology (the Race, Rabotev, and Hallesi) instead of mammalian probably didn't help. The Race has had over 50,000 Earth years to work on it so it may work perfectly on themselves and subject species. The alien Fleetlord and Senior Shiplord are later seen discussing that the drug has not been working as well as it should be.

Based on the more detailed description, stage one is actually a slightly more focused polygraph, and there's nothing to prove it lacks the same weaknesses.

When it was done to Corran Horn, he ended up confessing to every childhood misdeed committed in his entire life, which would have been amusing even at the time had the interrogator not provided a transcript to his father (a fellow officer). While also amusing and somewhat disturbing to the reader, the existence of not only such drugs used by a police force but stronger ones available to groups like, oh, the Empire, makes one wonder about how Leia managed to hold up to an interrogation by Darth Vader, when the arguably less-vicious Ysanne Isard had methods that would (with only mild exaggeration) have Corran "spilling secrets his <em>mother</em> had forgotten while he was in the womb".

Eventually, a local politician (who for obvious reasons doesn't want the car for himself either) helps him fob the car off as an all-American souvenir to a foreign politician who happens to be in town for a visit: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nikita Khrushchev</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983">V: The Final Battle</a></em>, the hero Mike Donovan is injected with an alien truth serum and fulfills this trope completely.

<ul><li> Maxwell Smart is drugged and ordered to tell his interrogators "everything you know". Naturally, this results in a seemingly endless stream of trivia, including multiplication tables.
</li><li> In another episode, Max is tasked with drugging a suspected enemy spy with a truth pill, while she gives him a sleeping drug. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedChaliceSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedChaliceSwitcheroo">Poisoned Chalice Switcheroo</a> later, he first tells everything to the <em>sleeping</em> spy, and later yet is talking to his boss...

Unfortunately, it also meant if anyone asked one of the sisters a question, <em>they</em> would have to answer with the truth.
<ul><li> Paige later uses the same spell, and the effects are very different. The "applies to everyone under this roof" and "the caster must answer honestly" aspects are dropped. The boyfriend she used it for (to see how he'd react to the family secret since the spell comes with automatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a>) provided some extra information <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's married</span> but was also able to lie.

But that's a Ferengi's metabolism for ya. Quark ironically is only too willing to talk, to stop these mad humans from jabbing him with sharp needles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>, Vulcans are apparently resistant or disciplined enough to defeat such measures. When a villain is interrogating T'Pol about the possibilities of time travel, she is able to respond using what is technically true: "The Vulcan science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em> also revealed that the Andorrians have an interrogation device specifically designed for Vulcans which removes their emotional control, thereby making them a lot less capable of deceitfully telling technical truths the way T'Pol does. The one time we see it in action, however, Shran is using it on Soval to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">confirm that he really is telling them the truth</a> about a planned Vulcan invasion.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> also revealed in some episodes that while the Vulcan mind-meld can be used to extract information from unwilling subjects, some of the Cardassians (Gul Dukat, for one) had a conditioning technique to block the Vulcans from using it on them. Also, one alien government had developed a means to alter and block its agents' memories while they were working undercover so that they would actually <em>believe</em> they were who they were making themselves out to be if anyone tried using any of these methods on them, meaning their interrogators would get nothing useful out of them even though they were being completely honest.
</li><li> The "Chain of Command" two-parter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> has the Cardassian interrogator of the captured Picard use truth serum while torturing him. Unfortunately for the Cardassians, Picard doesn't have the information they want (because his superiors weren't dumb enough to send him on a dangerous spy mission with current intel on fleet deployments). The torturer himself doesn't really care, he just enjoys his work and breaking people, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPlusTortureEqualsFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPlusTortureEqualsFive">2 + Torture = 5</a> ordeal.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> episode "That Hope is You", Michael Burnham is subjected to some kind of truth serum by the guards in the holo-trading station. It's not clear if her physiology is different to what they're used to or if, as one of the guards suggests, the other one's been experimenting with the formula, but it initially has no clear effect, then sends her to sleep for a few seconds. When she wakes up, her thought processes are sufficiently scrambled that what she says is <em>true</em>, but doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless you know her story already.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UFO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UFO">UFO</a></em> episode "Computer Affair". The "GL-7 serum", one of the "new anodynes", is used on a captured alien at Straker's orders to lower his resistance so he'll talk. Unfortunately, it kills him instead, due to either his different biology or him somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntarySuicideMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntarySuicideMechanism">committing suicide to prevent himself from talking</a>.
</li><li> Humorously used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> after Kelly gets bitten by a swarm of poisonous Samoan beetles during a commercial she's filming for an extermination company. Bud discovers that the Samoan people use the bugs' venom to create a truth serum, and Kelly ends up repeatedly telling the truth at the worst possible times.
</li><li> Played straight on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> when Sayid is restrained and given an unnamed drug by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">members of the Dharma Initiative, who believe him to be a hostile spy</span>, and informed that he will have no choice but to answer their questions truthfully.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> has occasionally used "hyoscine pentothal" in the past (a fictional substance whose name is taken from the names of two real substances).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> had an episode where Roscoe returns from a police convention with, among other things, a syringe filled with truth serum. Boss Hogg sits on the syringe about halfway through the episode, injecting himself with the serum. Hilarity ensues when he can't stop telling the truth, including calling the IRS and confessing to cheating on his taxes for several years.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MIHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MIHigh">M.I. High</a></em> episode "Spy Animals", a truth serum causes the teachers to start blurting out what they really think about the students and other members of staff, and causes Daisy to tell her friends that she is really a spy. They think this is a story to cover up the fact that she is going out with Blane. Blane attempts to get Daisy to say what she really thinks about him while she is still under the influence, but Lenny gives her the antidote before she can reply.
</li><li> Played fairly realistically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>. When Aeryn is captured by the Scarrans and tortured for information, she is injected with truth serum (from a massive syringe): the drug merely lowers her resistance to questioning while also causing physical pain, disorientation, and eventual unconsciousness. After several rounds of torture and several lies, she finally tells the truth- though by then, she's barely able to speak coherently.
<ul><li> Admittedly this didn't stop her from getting sarcastic with the torturers during the first session:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Aeryn:</strong> No, don't use that, I won't lie to you. I'll just tell you what you want to know.
</div><div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAxeNurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAxeNurse">Battle Axe Nurse</a>:</strong> You wouldn't lie to me?
</div><div class="indent">(She injects Aeryn at the shoulder.) <br/><strong>Aeryn:</strong> Yes, of course I'd lie to you, you <em>stupid</em> bitch!
</div><ul><li> The Scarrans are also mildly psionic and can use their powers to force the truth out of people, though it can still be an evasive half-truth. In the same series of episodes, when John is captured attempting to free Aeryn, he claims that he decided to because Aeryn was prettier than the nurse and that once he had freed her he was going to have lots of sex and babies with her.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting example cropped up on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>. In the episode "Chuck Versus The Truth," the villain of the week uses a poison that has the side effect of inducing truth-telling tendencies in its victims. Chuck, Casey, and Sarah are all ultimately administered the drug. Since this is a comedy, it's mostly played for laughs, as when Casey admits Sarah is better at picking locks than he is. But at the end of the episode, Chuck asks Sarah if she has any real feelings for him. Her answer: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> No.</span> At the very end of the episode, it's revealed Sarah has built up an immunity to truth serums.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> ("Truth or Consequences").

The resultant babblings about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheSuperman">Ralph's supersuit</a> are dismissed as crazy talk.

Napoleon, who is out of the loop this episode and legitimately doesn't know, just starts acting drunk; but Illya is compelled to give up the information after minimal resistance.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget">Human Target</a></em>, the plan is for Ilsa to give the villain of the episode wine dosed with such a chemical so he'll tell them his password. Played with, in that to convince him that it isn't poisoned, she also drinks it herself, after which she tells him the whole plan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>: Lister injected the prison warden with sodium thiopental, which apparently caused him to come to a meeting late explaining that he had been shagging the science officer's wife and he hadn't had time to change out of his Batman costume.

Coulson tells her about the top-secret truth serum SHIELD has access to — then injects <em>Ward</em> with it, and leaves the room, letting Skye grill Ward and satisfy herself that SHIELD is actually on the side of good. (And, in the process, learn embarrassing details about Ward.) In a later episode, Ward tells Skye that there never was a truth serum, and it was all a ruse to get her on board the team. Well, <em>someone's</em> lying, that's for sure. Given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ward later turns out to be a HYDRA agent,</span> it probably was fake.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInvisibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInvisibleMan">The Invisible Man</a></em> has Claire accidentally injected with an experimental truth serum which causes constant babbling, paranoia, and loss of inhibitions. It's played for drama when she struggles to resist revealing secrets about the Quicksilver program and laughs when she starts trying to violate Darien.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a></em> plays with this. Tony gets sick of Jeannie doing him favors and commands her that the next time he asks for anything, she deny it. He ends up getting kidnapped by terrorists but due to his previous command, Jeannie can't directly rescue him. The terrorists try to give him truth serum to make him talk, so Jeannie casts a spell on him that forces him to speak in a different language when under the effect of the serum.

They dose him with sodium pentothal under the guise of an inoculation for his new post. As sodium pentothal is a low-level anesthetic and not a magic drug like the Heroes expect, Schultz doesn't just tell them, but he acts dazed and dopey (rambling, breaking into song) and gives them enough hints during a conversation with LeBeau about the food there that they can figure out where the lab is.

They repeatedly (and truthfully) insist that no-one sent them, that they just work for the mall itself. The Soviets, assuming Steve and Robin are lying to them, shoot them up with a severely disorienting drug in hopes that they won't have the presence of mind to keep their cover stories straight. The General isn't happy when Steve continues to insist they just work at the mall, though Steve eventually spills that they found their lab due to intercepting their cover frequency by sheer luck and that Dustin and Erica escaped and likely told the authorities about the Soviets. Said drug winds up making Steve and Robin puke their guts out after being severely high for hours.

When one of the bystanders finds himself impressed by this, he says, "Wow!

<div class="indent"><strong>Sheriff Blubs:</strong> So after further investigation, turns out there <em>is</em> no "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyAlias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyAlias">Dr. Medicine</a>" in Gravity Falls! <br/><strong>Deputy Durland:</strong> You better have a durn good explanation for this. <br/><strong>Stan:</strong> Oh, and I do! You see, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">I lied to you</a>. In addition, I've been parking in handicapped spaces, shoplifting fireworks, and smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines. Also, you're fat.
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> episode "Let's Play Spies", Mr. Cat injects Kaeloo with a truth serum. Eventually, all of the main four get injected with it and blurt out personal secrets to each other.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> shows that the Interrogation Droid seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> uses this to get information. The screaming is apparently because the needle is very big, and the injection itself rather painful. The effect is depicted fairly realistically, with Hera becoming very blunt and losing much of her vocal filter. The effects wore off pretty quickly, most likely due to the adrenaline caused by subsequent combat burning it out of her system so that when she finally confessed her feelings for Kanan, she was completely sober.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>, Gargamel captures the Smurfette and prepares a truth serum to force her to reveal the Smurf village's location. Unfortunately for him, Azrael steps on the potions book and accidentally turns the page to a potion of compulsive lying. In another episode, Papa Smurf gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman">Snake Oil Salesman</a> an ointment that acted like this to prevent him from ever lying about his products.

It works as intended, but what he does learn from the afflicted isn't interesting at all. He does hit Suzy with it during a scuffle with Perry by accident, who then flat-out blurts her attempts to make Candace look bad all morning.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, Zatanna casts a spell during the interrogation of Professor Anthony Ivo, forcing him to blurt out the location of his rival's lab. He even glances down when his mouth moves against his will.
</li><li> Varian from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em> manages to render a truth serum from a potion that inverts a person's most prominent personality trait.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Happened to the first child who eventually accused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> of sexually molesting him. Initially, his father Evan Chandler had been accusing Jackson of sexual abuse of his son, but the son, Jordan, himself wouldn't support the allegations. Eventually Evan, being a dentist, took his son in to pull a tooth and used <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_Amytal">sodium amytal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as the sedative for the procedure. Sodium amytal is known "on the street" as a truth serum and is generally illegal to use in dentistry. Psychiatrists know the drug better for <em>rendering users susceptible to suggestion and being able to induce false memories</em>. It was during this event that Evan claims Jordan first spoke of being abused by Jackson, and it is after this point he began supporting his father's story.
</li><li> The closest things to a real truth serum we have... are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">alcohol</a> and marijuana. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Project MKULTRA</a> found this out the hard way when they discovered that while the more "interesting" mind-bending substances they tried out on unsuspecting subjects were more likely to make such subjects want more substance rather than brainwash them, the FBI had actually gotten actionable intelligence on a bank heist by lacing a captured Mafioso's cigarettes with THC. And just as they were to be declassified, the said "interesting" mind-bending substances were discreetly experimented with by a handful of individuals and spread through colleges, and... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">you know</a>..., and it led to telling <em>another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs">kind of truth</a>.
</li><li> Hypnosis was once thought to work like this. There is still a persistent myth that it provides perfect and accurate memory recall. Unfortunately, hypnosis is just as unreliable as any other real-life "truth serum," and the human brain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination">very prone to modifying or making up memories</a> — this might be said to be <em>the</em> main issue with the very concept as a whole: it assumes that human memory is infallible. (However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters">it has been shown to be somewhat reliable in increasing someone's memory and recall of some kinds of information when objective proof of what the subject is trying to remember is on hand</a>.)
