<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"People are angry, but they can't explain why."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>PressTV reporter</strong>, on the source of the "Muslamic Ray Guns" meme
</div></div><p>This is when a character hates and/or blames another one for something that is at best only partially their fault. Evidence may be willfully ignored or misinterpreted to support their position, and it usually takes a titanic effort to get the hater to change their mind (if any is even possible). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateAtFirstSight">Sometimes, it just happens once they see the other character.</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope comes in a few variations that, while distinct enough to probably be their own tropes, will be grouped to avoid confusion. They are: misplaced/overinflated blame, inarticulate dislike, and ungrounded jealousy/prejudice.
</p><p>When it's misplaced or overinflated blame, the hater assigns blame to the character (often more than justifiable) not through some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">misleading evidence</a>, but out of an emotional need to blame <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat">someone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (often in situations where no blame could be assigned). If the character <em>did</em> deserve some blame, the hater will react much like in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight">Rant-Inducing Slight</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">Minor Injury Overreaction</a> and latch on to them as a convenient target. What's sad about this is that a hero who suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome">Samaritan Syndrome</a> may well <em>let</em> the hater nurse this grudge if they actually <em>did</em> fail, even in some minor way, out of overblown guilt. Some heroes will allow this even if they <em>didn't</em> earn it to allow the hater an outlet, which usually comes back to haunt them as the hater goes on to exact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution">Misplaced Retribution</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>An inarticulate dislike is (oddly) easier to quantify. The hater has a genuine dislike for the character, but either can't or won't put it to words. It may be that the hater feels insecure or jealous, and rather than face those feelings, they sublimate the dislike into a nebulous cloud of barely coherent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> directed at the character. Or it may be a truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">irrational hatred</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">has no basis in reality</a>. Because of this vagueness, the hater may end up disliking seemingly random traits of the character, which can be noted when it isn't an issue if <em>other</em> people do it.
</p><p>Lastly, ungrounded jealousy or prejudice stems from hating something that the character has no control over, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityAsAnExcuseForJerkassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityAsAnExcuseForJerkassery">being disabled</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse">extremely beautiful</a>. While in these cases, the hater has a concrete "reason" and definable focus for their hate, it's just not rational to hate someone for something they have no control over. Now, if said character abused their disability or advantage to manipulate others or rested on their laurels, it wouldn't be this trope.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>It bears repeating that in all of these cases, the hater may suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate">You Are What You Hate</a> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism">Internalized Categorism</a>, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryTunnelvision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryTunnelvision">sublimating</a> the blame, guilt, or jealousy for some other thing the hated has, is, or has done into a more "acceptable" irrational hatred rather than face the ugly truth inside themselves. Getting the hater to notice this or admit to it usually requires that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheWrongDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheWrongDog">Kick The Wrong Dog</a> in the pursuit of their prejudice.
</p><p>Compare the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Inspector Javert</a>, who pursues someone regardless of their culpability. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay">Armoured Closet Gay</a>'s hatred of gays is usually born of this, and so is most hatred for any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">Category Traitor</a>. Sometimes overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence">Feeling Oppressed by Their Existence</a>.

He decides that it's Harry's fault Sirius died and that he won't come to the titular Family Nights that Hogwarts starts holding (four times a year the parents come in to take a look at their children's work) unless Harry improves his work ethic. It soon becomes clear that he has completely unreasonable expectations, insisting even as Harry works himself to the point of collapse that he isn't working hard enough.

Jack's hatred encompasses overinflated blame (Jack blames Spider-Woman for protecting the innocent bystanders he enjoys preying on and for interfering with his sick "fun"), ungrounded prejudice (because Spider-Woman didn't give in to her dark side the way he did) and inarticulate dislike (the fact that Spider-Woman uses her powers to protect innocent people when she could be wreaking all kinds of havoc makes Jack's blood boil) to the point where he spends half his time plotting larger criminal schemes and the other half of the time obsessing over Spider-Woman and how he wants to make her suffer.

<ul><li> Severus Snape has always hated Harry and treated him like dirt throughout the entire series. While the two cultivate a genuinely antagonistic relationship with one another, nearly all of Snape's hatred towards Harry stems from his hatred of Harry's father James. James and Snape utterly depised one another as students (Snape toward James because of the latter's better family life, talents and being just as good while James toward Snape because he was a fervant admirer of the Dark Arts among other reasons.) When Harry has his first class with Snape, James Potter has already been dead for a decade. Personality wise, Harry and James are <em>very</em> different (Harry tends to take more after his mother), however Snape's hatred blinds him to that fact. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's also possible his hatred of Harry stems from the fact he's living proof that Lily, Harry's mother, chose James over him.</span>
</li><li> The hatred Uncle Vernon, and to a lesser extent, Petunia, holds for Harry is unwarranted and unjust. They intensely disliked his parents for being 'weird' and passed that prejudice onto Harry. Petunia though is more personal, since she always felt inferior to her younger sister Lily since she went to the magic school and doubled down on her want for 'normalcy' to deal with it.
</li><li> Ron quickly starts hating Viktor Krum (because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">went to the Yule Ball with Hermione</a>) and just about every boy Ginny dated (because, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySisterIsOffLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySisterIsOffLimits">they dated Ginny</a>).

Not that she has anything but disdain for everyone but herself. Given her behavior towards Hagrid and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">the centaurs</a>, she also seems under the impression that part-humans all share "near-human intelligence" and thus treats them like small children, which is especially insulting considering that Hagrid and the centaurs are clearly of human intelligence (well, Hagrid can be a bit of an idiot sometimes, but so can all humans, including Umbridge). The only reason remotely given for his mindset is Sirius's guess that she's afraid of them. And then we learn from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that he is right. Her megalomania and desire to control and dominate leads her to feel insecure by those who cannot be categorized and she is unable to accept the existence of people outside her sphere of control. In the movie, she also tells Harry and Hermione, "You know, I really hate children."

When second-hand news states Rand has done something terrible to Morgase, he believes it immediately and develops an all-consuming hatred for the man despite two loved ones who both defend Rand wholeheartedly. This includes misplaced/over-inflated blame as the terrible event is something for which Gawyn feels <a class="urllink" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat">an emotional need to blame<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> someone as he can't go back and change what happened; later it becomes unfounded jealousy/prejudice due to Rand being the hero.
<ul><li> Demandred, one of the series' main villains, displays an absolutely <em>massive</em> level of hate for Rand (originally for Rand's prior incarnation, Lews Therin) that far outstrips anything the Dragon ever did to him- at least from anybody else's perspective. From Lews Therin's POV, it was a friendly rivalry. From Demandred's, it was being repeatedly shown up for his whole life in every single aspect of his life, including <em>height</em>. When he finally snapped, it's said that he came to hate Lews Therin (and later Rand) more than <em>anyone</em> had ever hated <em>anything</em>, and for far less direct cause than many of his fellow Forsaken had to hate LTT. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the last book, however, Rand clearly <em>does</em> feel somewhat guilty over the fact that he, as Lews Therin, encouraged their rivalry and indirectly contributed to Demandred's deteriorating mental state</span>.

<ul><li> Quite a lot of the abundant factionalism, sexism, racism and classism found in the series is repeatedly shown to have a whopping great wedge of this supporting the various grievances and "justifications". Even the goodish guys aren't above writing whole groups of people and families off for highly emotive, questionable reasons. Sure, every side can find both fictional and non-fictional rationalizations to hate on another to seek revenge for perceived wrongs done... but, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">kind of the whole problem</a>.

That level of resentment seems pretty harsh when memories and flashbacks show that his mother was unable to even protect <em>herself</em> from being beaten by the pimp, that she loved her son enough to bake a birthday cake for him, and, based on Christian's focus on having submissives within their late teens to early twenties because they remind him of his mother, that she was in her teens herself when she gave birth and had to raise a child on her own, in terrible conditions. It also comes across as harsh, given that Christian doesn't direct anywhere near that level of hatred towards the pimp himself, who was the one who actually <em>did</em> hurt Christian.

Regina's mother Cora puts the young Princess Snow in danger so Regina will rescue her, enabling Cora to marry Regina off to King Leopold. Snow is delighted by the idea of having a new mother, and Regina begins to care for her. However, Regina is in love with the stable boy, Daniel, so she doesn't want to marry Leopold. Snow discovers Regina and Daniel's affair, but basically understands Regina's explanation that although Leopold is a good man, Regina doesn't love him but instead loves Daniel and wants to be with him; she promises to keep their secret. Cora then tricks Snow into revealing Regina's secret, by claiming she only wants to help Regina be happy and by playing off of Snow's idealized concept of a mother due to the loss of her own. Cora then murders Daniel. Regina is angry at Cora, but inexplicably assigns at least as great a measure of blame to the child Snow White who was manipulated by the same harridan who destroyed her own youth, and dedicates the next four decades to efforts at destroying Snow's happiness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> is probably one of the most hilarious and famous examples. Michael's hatred of Toby has been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> on the show. Despite liking almost everyone else that he works with, Michael hates Toby with a passion. Michael explains that he hates Toby because "Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for Corporate. So hes really not a part of our family." Toby constantly tries to tolerate Michael's rude behavior, tries to be nice to him, and doesn't have problems with anyone else. Michael even mocks Toby for being divorced and even rejects Toby's attempts to help Michael through tough times (The Deposition is probably one of the most famous examples). Ironically, the episode "Take your Daughter to Work Day" has Michael get along very well with Toby's daughter Sasha and is one of the only episodes where Michael is nice to Toby.
<ul><li> It's understandable once you realize that due to Michael's management style, he would have been in front of HR numerous times. Toby, as nice as he tries to be, is the one who always has to tell Michael no.
</li><li> Jim also showed signs of the Toby hate when he was left in charge in "Survivor Man." Toby, because Michael had made his birthday celebration a 5 minute party in the parking lot, calmly asks if he could have his own, since it was "Birthday Month" at the office. Jim had this to say in a interview: Toby's great. He's great, but sometime he can be a little bit much. (mimicking Toby's voice)"I don't see the harm in that" Well, it's a cake, Toby, so come on!
</li><li> Amusingly, David Wallace, the Chief Financial Officer from Corporate, has a similar loathing for an HR worker named Kendall. It's every bit as bizarre as Michael's fixation, if not more so, since Wallace is shown to be one of the nicest characters on the show, and he brings it up during Jim's interview, which they were both being perfectly jovial in: "We have this very irritating HR guy here. He's probably the only person you're not going to like."

At one point he even expels her for being a suspect in a crime she was soon cleared of (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kendra's death</span>, which he probably already suspected she was innocent of), and Joyce has to go over his head to get Buffy re-enrolled.

By Act 3, her grudge has bloomed into a full-blown desire for revenge. It may have been simply be that Grace can't accept her capture was the result of her own failings.

Why? He was in favor of Shinra building a Mako reactor there...which everyone else except one person was. The whole town took part in making it happen, and he gets blamed for Shinra razing the town to the ground. Weirdly, he blames himself. At worst, he was maybe a strong advocate who swayed some people to his side, which doesn't absolve them of responsibility, and still the blame should ultimately fall on the evil, greedy corporation that actually did the deed. Except for this part, he DOES blame Shinra for everything else bad that is happening to the world, why else do you think he made up a rebel group trying to sabotage the company?

<ul><li> A great many people in the series hate defense attorneys in general, viewing them as scum who live only to get criminals out of prison. While a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">amoral defense attorneys</a> exist, nobody seems to comment on how defense attorneys are needed for the people who are wrongfully arrested (which seems to happen quite frequently).

While the leader of all witches, the Great Witch Bezella, did attack the town hundreds of years ago, the townsfolk consider a person being a witch to be a crime in and of itself and are perfectly fine with putting any proven witches in an iron coffin and dropping them into a fiery pit. In fact, before Phoenix's intervention, it never occurred to them not to punish witches who hadn't actually committed a crime. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the end of the game, their hatred of witches is explained: the Storyteller - Espella's father - incorporated it into the mass hypnosis of the townspeople, intending to have the purging of witches and eventual killing of Bezella serve as a sort of hardcore therapy for his daughter (who blamed herself for burning her town down and believed a witch possessed her when it happened).</span>

Phoenix is faced with nuclear heat from the moment he steps into a courtroom and reveals that he's a defense attorney, with the crowd calling for his head on a plate. That's not much of a euphemism, considering that the Kingdom even has a law that gives the same punishment to any lawyers that defend a suspect that is found guilty (read: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">execution for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">murder</a>).

They are reviled and outcast by pretty much everybody. Which makes little to no sense considering that the plot-defining problem of that soaring city is the fear of falling out of the sky.
