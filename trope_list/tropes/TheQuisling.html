Heck, prior to this, he was known for helping explorer Fritjof Nansen in humanitarian work during the Armenian Genocide and Russian famine. So not only was he a traitor to his nation, he became a traitor to humanity. The poster person of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Les Collaborateurs</a>, The Quisling appears whenever one country or culture is being conquered, occupied, or colonized by another. They do everything possible to curry favor with the new rulers - they speak the invaders language more often than their own, apes the foreign customs, and refer to their hometown as New Invaderia instead of Freedomville. They might justify this on the grounds that by securing a position of power and influence they can ensure the occupation is as painless and least oppressive as possible. Sometimes, this person <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">will have been a friend</a> of the heroes before the invasion, but will often be someone who had always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian">given our heroes a hard time</a>. Often, they will also try to make them "see reason" and stop their futile attempts to restore the old regime. Frequently has elements of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>. When conversing with the conquering leaders they will probably be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpinionFlipflop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpinionFlipflop">Opinion Flip-Flop</a> personified.

</p><p>What distinguishes the Quisling from other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Collaborateurs</a> is authority. A Quisling will never be considered an equal by the conquerors but will have a position of power that will be used to influence the conquered people. They will often be the local "poster boy/girl/etc" for submission to the conquerors. If a character has a minor job within the conquerors' hierarchy or simply chooses to accept the conquerors' rule rather than resist, then they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Collaborateurs</a> but are not Quislings.

</p><ul><li> The first against the wall when the revolution comes. Disposing of or disgracing them is one of the first major victories for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, and now the real struggle begins as the invaders start to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRebelScum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRebelScum">those rebel scum</a> seriously...
</li><li> As the rebellion grows and its victory draws near, they opportunistically switch or are coerced to switch sides. Theyre disgraced and held in even more contempt, but manage to be just useful enough to save their neck.
</li><li> They finally do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and joins La Resistance for real, becoming a redeemed hero in the process (though expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">redemption to equal death</a> in a lot of cases). Most common when the apparent betrayal is really a futile attempt at trying to moderate the oppression of the invaders, and they finally go too far.
</li><li> They were actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> of La Resistance's leader all along, playing a dangerous double game to act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a>. They might still be vilified in the histories, but the heroes will remember their name with honor.
</li><li> The first against the wall when the revolution <em>ends</em>, as the newly freed heroes are only too eager to convict the heinous traitor in a court of law (or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteExecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteExecution">lynch them in the street</a>). This is what happened to the historical Quisling, as the Norwegians <em>re-instituted the death penalty just to apply it to him.</em>
</li><li> The revolution fails or is temporarily crushed, and theyre killed, "purged" or otherwise done away with <em>anyway</em>, because the higher-ups don't trust a former member of the conquered nation (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">let alone a traitor</a>). Alternatively, they may kill them if the revolution is doing <em>too well</em>, to get rid of an incompetent puppet leader who not only can't control their own people but is only furthering this unrest.
</li><li> If The Quisling is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who earnestly believes that selling their nation out would benefit the people in the long run (as opposed to just being an opportunist or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a>) the heroes may well decide that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">Strawman Has a Point</a> and adopt the Quisling's goals even after stripping the original of political power, especially if they simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">did what was necessary</a> to try to save as many people as they could in the face of an overwhelming enemy they couldn't possibly defeat.
</li><li> The Quisling will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">outfox both the heroes and their puppet masters</a> and achieve some hidden agenda that both sides oppose and/or become a legitimate power player in their own right, like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em>. Since this requires a greater-than-normal amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastardry</a> to pull off and toadyism isn't viewed as a cool <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues">Evil Virtue</a> this rarely happens.
</li></ul><p>Note that "Quisling" is rarely heard in the United States. This is because Americans have their own term for the same thing. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, below.

<ul><li> Writer James Lileks has humorously referred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsMeetTheMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsMeetTheMeat">certain advertising mascots for meat products</a> as "quislings": <em>e.g.,</em> a <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131220315500/http://www.lileks.com/institute/orphanage/orphans/cudahy2.html">"quisling pig" advertising pork products<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or a <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131220321700/http://www.lileks.com/institute/orphanage/orphans/dave.html">"quisling fish" selling fish-cakes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> Humorously averted by the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A">Chick-fil-A<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Cows, who ask that America "EAT MOR CHIKIN". Chick-fil-A had previously had an anthropomorphic chicken for a mascot; its switch to cows was widely seen as a wise move, in part because this subtrope leads people to think that anything with cows would be for milk, or perhaps beef... nope.
<ul><li> There was a somewhat similar advertising campaign used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> in Finland around the turn of the millennium, where an anthropomorphic pig was standing on the streets around Christmas shouting <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MIDusVEjcE">Syökää Kanaa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, meaning "eat chicken" and telling people about promotions at McDonald's. Naturally the pig had ulterior motives for this, namely the fact that during the traditional Finnish Christmas dinner is ham.

And later the Knight of Zero, right-hand man to the new Emperor...his childhood friend, Lelouch. Who he helped dismantle the empire entirely. But since their plan involved Lelouch building an image as the worst dictator in history, and Suzaku seeming to die in service of that dictator, all but the small handful of people who figured out what was happening will remember him as nothing but a traitor. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">And that's just fine with him</a></span>.
<ul><li> The Kyoto House is the last type, as they publicly surrendered to the Britannians, but they secretly support the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">JLF and later the Black Knights</a> by building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Knightmare Frames</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> A <em>very</em> strange and unique example of this comes from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em> franchise. Ghintec/Jinto starts out a little ambivalent about the centerpiece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Space Elves</a> of the work, the Abh, but by the start of the second "season" of the TV series he's unflinchingly loyal to the Abh and their conquering empire (in part due to, uh, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect">his loyalty to Lamhirh/Lafiel</a>, one of the princesses of the Abh). The people of his own world definitely see him (and his dad) as examples of this trope <em>in-show</em> and it causes a lot of trouble later on. The unique element?

They plan to use the population of Bakura as slaves to breed so that they can have a supply of humans whose life can be sucked out of their bodies and into Ssi-Ruuk war machines.

Equally unsurprisingly, these people are viewed as quislings by the deposed masters, and many acts of murder and sabotage are carried out by the latter, who consider themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>.
<ul><li> One of them, Skahaz mo Kandaq a.k.a. the Shavepate (the head of Daenerys' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>), however, is hinted to be far more complex than that. Depending on which theory you buy, he may be preparing to designate himself Dany's successor or become a full-blown Starscream.
</li><li> Roose Bolton, who betrayed the Northern kingdom to the Lannisters and personally murdered his king Robb Stark, is a definitely negative example. Walder Frey did the same with the Riverlands at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty">The Red Wedding</a>, but failed: Littlefinger was appointed their Lord Paramount instead of him. However, his second son Emmon is made Lord of Riverrun and many of his descendants get marriages with Lannisters for this. Unfortunately, this has backfired with the Boltons and the Freys, as they are despised throughout the North and the Riverlands and Walder's descendants are getting murdered by the angry relatives of those they killed.
</li><li> A more positive example during Aegon's conquest. When Aegon began conquering the Riverlands, many of the River Lords joined him. After Black Harren Hoare and House Hoare were wiped out, Lord Edmyn Tully was made Lord Paramount of the Trident. However, Harren the Black was a cruel tyrant who had beggared the Riverlands and worked thousands to death building Harrenhal, and his grandfather Harwyn Handhand Hoare had invaded the Riverlands.
</li><li> When Aegon wiped out House Gardener, the rulers of the Reach, their castle of Highgarden was surrendered to him by its stewards, the Tyrells, and Aegon made them rulers of the Reach for this.

Each Chaos God promises power in return for loyalty and worship, although the power they grant you is often at a high cost, and most don't survive it.

Prior to this, he was known for his humanitarian work in Russia and Armenia with Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen. Nazi Germany invaded Norway on April 9th 1940 and, hoping for an easy capitulation like Denmark the day previous, asked Quisling to form his own government. Quisling attempted to do so, only to find he had no popular support and no one listened to him. The Germans attempted to negotiate support for him with the King of Norway and the government in exile but were flatly refused. He was finally appointed Minister President of Norway in 1942. When Germany lost the war, he was accused of high treason and sentenced to death by firing squad (did we mention that Norway reinstated the death penalty <em>just for him?</em> No? Well, they did that). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> was created in an editorial in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">The Times</a> in 1940 and quickly picked up by other news agencies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>.
<div class="indent"><em>"To writers, the word Quisling is a gift from the gods. If they had been ordered to invent a new word for traitor... they could hardly have hit upon a more brilliant combination of letters. Aurally it contrives to suggest something at once slippery and tortuous."</em>
</div></li><li> The United States has a much older "Quisling" in the form of <strong>Benedict Arnold</strong>, whose name has become synonymous with "traitor" in American English. As a general in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">the rebel Continental Army</a>, Arnold performed a number of particularly courageous acts, but a combination of financial troubles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">a perceived lack of recognition by his peers</a> convinced him to sell out his comrades to the British. He tried to take a fort (West Point, today the site of the US Military Academy) with him, but his plot failed and he ultimately fled back to Britain. Recent scholarship suggests that Arnold's wife <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Shippen">Peggy Shippen Arnold<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> might have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">instigated the betrayal</a>, though at the time she was cleared of charges. Some also say that there was a religious motive  as a staunch Protestant, he didn't like the idea of the Rebels accepting aid from Catholic France. The famous <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Monument">Boot Monument<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was erected in honor of his heroism at the Battle of Saratoga, but due to his later betrayal, it is the only US war memorial to exclude any mention of the honoree's name. Instead it simply alludes to his identity by describing his actions and the wound he received (a bullet to the foot, hence his boot being honored rather than the man himself). Historians believe that had he died in that battle, the name "Benedict Arnold" would probably be associated with schools, forts, and warships <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">named in honor of a national war hero</a>.

In 1940 he became President of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Wang Jingwei regime</a> based out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">Japanese-occupied areas of China</a>. His name is considered a byword for supreme treachery to a degree that makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">Benedict Arnold's</a> look petty. Fortunately for him, he died of natural causes in '44, though his wife was tried and found guilty of treason at the post-war Nanjing War Crimes trial. To be fair, Wang had good cause to believe that his defection could ensure that the relationship between China and Japan would be one of co-operation and not exploitation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">Additionally, the KMT had been forced to stoop to extreme levels to stop the brutal Japanese onslaught</a>. Their "scorched earth" policy, while largely successful, killed hundreds of thousands in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Yellow_River_flood">a man-made flood<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">completely pointless</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Changsha_fire">fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Wang hoped that with Japanese military backing, he could put an end to the war, topple Chiang's military dictatorship and rebuild China. However, the political situation changed as Japan moved to strike out at the Allies and the USA, and he quickly became little more than a puppet. All he could really do from then on was try to limit the worst excesses of the Japanese Army as they bled his country dry. Recent Chinese and Western assessments of Wang helped reinforce this view, and pointed out his important contributions during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Xinhai Revolution</a>. Nowadays, Wang is seen as a pitiable, naive fool within China these days, rather than a despicable coward.

He quickly found he didn't much care for the job and was constantly at odds with the Japanese and their exploitative zaibatsu corporations; the only reason he took it on was that the Japanese wanted a monarchist Quisling to rule the northeast, and he happened to be the only candidate for the job (having previously been the legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">Qing Dynasty</a> Emperor of China before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Xinhai Revolution</a>). After the war, he was imprisoned by the Soviets, then handed over to Communist China, and finally released, later dying of natural causes.

Laval had been obsessively anti-Nazi and anti-German prior to the fall of France, but afterward decided the Nazis were the inevitable winners and did everything possible to ingratiate himself to them. Formerly a prominent member of the Socialist Party, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Laval's defection disgusted the French left-wing to no end, with the socialists chanting "Death to Laval" as a rallying cry</a>, that the rest of France quickly picked up. When France was freed from Nazi rule, both Pétain and Laval were sentenced to death, though Pétain got his sentence commuted to life imprisonment by de Gaulle. Laval, lacking Pétain's record of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> heroism and advanced age, was given no such mercy.

Early in the war, he had been a fascist dictator — the very first of his kind, in fact — and conqueror in his own right, having come to power 11 whole years before Hitler, and with plans to carve out a "new Roman Empire" across the Mediterranean, for which he would inevitably need Quislings of his own. However, the Allies and his own monumental incompetence thwarted those plans and in 1943, the Allies singled him out to be the first Axis leader to fall. After the invasion of Sicily, with the Italian people angry and fed up with him, Mussolini was overthrown by King Victor Emmanuel III and General Badoglio, who signed an armistice that effectively saw Italy change sides and join the Allies. The Nazis didn't like that and ordered the troops they had in the country to take Italy back. German commandos freed Mussolini from his prison and he was appointed head of the "Italian Social Republic", or RSI. However, the RSI was just a puppet state for the Nazis, with Mussolini and his fellow Italian fascists now fully subservient to Hitler and the <em>Wehrmacht</em>. He was so hated by his own people that when he was finally recaptured near the end of the war, he was executed by firing squad and his body was unceremoniously strung up in public.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>:
<ul><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>'s favored tactics for conquest was to promise a local chieftain that he would be able to rule as a petty king over the conquered land if he agreed to provide information or troops to the Romans. What made it particularly effective was that the Romans punctiliously kept their word; submit, and Roman armies would protect you from others; don't submit, and the results would be very messy and very bad for you.
</li><li> The Romans created cultural quislings where they would demand the pliant chieftains' sons as "hostages" and ship them to Rome, where they would be treated to the high life and the best Roman culture could give. This resulted in the heirs becoming thoroughly Romanized and converting a previously "barbarian" kingdom into a miniature Rome. It backfired with the Germans, however: instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">Going Native</a>, Cherusci chief <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius">Arminius<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> used his Roman military training to plan what became the first successful bid for independence by a Roman territory. Though for the most part, this system worked. Conquered lands became increasingly Romanized over the decades, and Roman citizenship eventually extended almost all residents of the Roman Empire (aside from slaves).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">The British Empire</a> copied this by setting up British-style schools and universities all over the empire, and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy">sending the sons of native rulers (and some bright commoners) to Eton and Oxford</a>. Nehru, as one of these, was considered "the last Englishman to rule India". Likewise, the native leaders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal">princely states</a> within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj">The Raj</a> could also be considered this.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephialtes_of_Trachis">Ephialtes of Trachis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is remembered in Greece in the same way that Quisling is in Norway, and "Ephialtes" has become a synonym for traitor. He betrayed his countrymen and joined the Persians during the Battle of Thermopylae, showing them a mountain path that allowed the Persian forces to outflank the Spartan and other Greek forces that were defending the narrow pass. After the Persians were defeated, the Spartans put a bounty on his head. He was eventually killed in a bar fight by someone who knew nothing of the bounty, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Spartans tracked the killer down and paid him anyway.</a>
</li><li> A more recent example: Alaa Hussein Ali, Saddam Hussein's puppet leader following the invasion of Kuwait. Prior to the war he had held dual Kuwaiti/Iraqi citizenship. He had grown up in Kuwait and later went to Iraq to study. While there he joined Saddam's ruling political faction, the Baathist Party. Sometime after returning home he joined the Kuwaiti Army and held the rank of lieutenant when the invasion began. But rather than fight the invasion, he latched on to it and was appointed head of the "Republic of Kuwait" puppet regime. However, just one week later Saddam declared Kuwait was now part of Iraq and rewarded Ali by making him Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq. After Kuwait was liberated and Saddam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">army utterly devastated by Coalition forces</a>, Ali disappeared. He wasn't seen or heard from until 1998, seven years later, when he turned up in Norway. He returned to Kuwait in 2000 where he was convicted of treason.
</li><li> After the American Civil War, the formerly little-used term "scalawag" (meaning "scoundrel") became widely known as a term of abuse for Southerners allied with the North during the war and Reconstruction.
</li><li> The equivalent term in South Asia (or at least in the Bengal region) is 'Mir Jafar'. Mir Jafar was a courtier and a general in the court of the Nawab of Bengal, Sirajuddowla. He made a pact with Robert Clive of the East India Company and during the historical Battle of Plassey, stood by and did nothing while Sirajuddowla's army was slaughtered by the British Army. This treachery thus led to the beginning of the Company's political domination of India and eventually to the British Raj and 200 years of political, economic, and social domination.
</li><li> People who suck up to invaders don't always end up condemned by history.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky">Alexander Nevsky<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a Russian prince who first rose to prominence as a military leader in the aftermath of the Mongol invasions of 1223-1240, winning several victories against invading Catholic armies. Rather than try to fight the Mongols, he did everything he could to placate them. He was successful; Russia ended up with a better deal from the Mongols than they gave to other nations they had invaded and conquered. Today, Alexander Nevsky is considered a national hero of Russia and is a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church. In a context, he is more of a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> example.
<ul><li> Nevsky's good name derives in part from the fact that the Catholics (the Swedes, Germans, and Poles) were trying to convert the Russians to Catholicism, while the Mongols didn't give a damn what church the Russians were members of so long as they paid tribute.
</li><li> The first few princes of Moscow - starting with Daniel, Alexander Nevsky's youngest son - continued collaborating, and were able to expand their territory and conquer other petty Russian principalities with the approval and sometimes active support of the Mongols. Eventually, the Muscovite state grew strong enough to first break free from Mongol rule and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">conquer all the remnants of the Golden Horde</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_P._Laurel">Jose P. Laurel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is today mostly known as the President of the Philippines during World War II, but he had an illustrious political career both before and after the war. Although in his case it was actually a subversion because he was basically told to do so by the exiled president, Manuel L. Quezon. He was thus this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToScapegoat">Promoted to Scapegoat</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge">Mole in Charge</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons why the beatification of Croatian archbishop <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Stepinac">Aloysius Stepinac<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is kiiiiind of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> generator among Catholics is that he has been accused of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_clergy_involvement_with_the_Usta%C2%9Ae">being this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ustasha">the Ustasha<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the horrifyingly brutal Nazi-inspired group that ruled Croatia during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>. His defenders say that he <em>initially</em> welcomed the Independent State of Croatia, but by 1942 he had started to openly condemn the Nazi-aligned state's atrocities against Jews and Serbs, and even spoke against the Ustasha in public, but was unable to do lots to help the Ustasha targets.
</li><li> Only the truly famous or infamous are known to history by a single name. One of these is Bessos. Bessos was a Persian nobleman who ruled Sogdia, the largest province in the Persian Empire. After the battle of Gaugamela as the Great King was fleeing to the Persian heartland with Alexander breathing down their necks, Bessos and another nobleman plotted to kill him. This action guaranteed Alexander's victory, which Bessos and his cronies had hoped to be rewarded by Alexander for. Alexander was (depending on the source) either smarter, more honorable, or more idealistic than Bessos realized. Bessos' role in the plot was revealed, and the Sogdians captured him and tied him to a post on the side of a road with a sign reading "this is Bessos the dog" in Greek around his neck. Alexander, for his case only, decided to use the standard Persian punishment for treason: impalement. Normally he employed the somewhat more humane Macedonian punishment of a poisoned arrow. Basically, Bessos is the guy who killed the Achaemenid Empire. oops.
</li><li> In 1306, English forces besieging Scottish rebels at Kildrummy Castle managed to bribe a royal Scottish blacksmith named Osbourne who, in exchange for all the gold he could carry, set fire to the defenders' food supply. Once the castle was taken, the English, who were disgusted by his greed, melted the gold and poured it down his throat.
