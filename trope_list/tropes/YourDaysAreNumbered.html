<ul><li> This is parodied with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Coach" Ohta</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster">GunBuster</a></em>, who is poisoned by space radiation and is presumed to only have six months to live. This sends Kazumi into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> when she thinks he's passed on while she and Noriko are preparing to fight the Space Monsters in the titular mecha. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not only is he still alive when they get back, Kazumi and Coach get married and spend a year together before he finally <em>does</em> pass on.</span>

It's claimed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ymir Fritz, the being who originally held the powers of the titans, died thirteen years to the day after gaining her powers</span>. This doesn't bode well for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren and Armin</span> as by best count the former has eight years left, probably even less, while the latter only just gained powers before discovering this.
<ul><li> The events after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> focus heavily on this particular plot point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marley refers to it as a "Tenure", and begins the process of selecting the next Warrior in the final years.

The cast soon learns that this is true for the whole lot of them as Zearth's pilots; a lottery picks out who'll be next, and the time is decided randomly. The main story is arguably to see how each of the characters deal with this knowledge, in light of their own lives.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuNoHatsukoiWoKimiNiSasagu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuNoHatsukoiWoKimiNiSasagu">Boku no Hatsukoi wo Kimi ni Sasagu</a></em>, main character Takuma is expected not to reach adulthood.

Both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tooya and Aya</span> know it, hence the scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tooya begs Yuuhi to take care of Aya and their baby when he kicks the bucket</span>. Though he did add that he's not sure.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Rosette made a contract with Chrono, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demon</a>, saying that she will give him the ability to use his powers at the cost of her own lifespan. The sign of their contract is a watch Rosette wears around her neck, which counts down the time she has left to the very minute.
<ul><li> Also, it's revealed in flashbacks that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mary Magdalene had seen visions from her childhood that she would be killed by someone named Chrono. Once she meets him, she's well aware that it means she will soon die by his hand, but willingly leaves with him anyway, believing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a></span>.

<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> each human has an "expiration date" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a>, and humans who've traded half their remaining life for "shinigami eyes", can see. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWritingBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWritingBook">Death Notes</a> cause those whose names are written in them to die sometime before their original appointed time, and when a shinigami does that their victim's remaining time is added to their own, humans aren't so lucky. Though apparently, if a shinigami kills a human who was supposed to cause the death of another human they crumble into dust for breaking the rules and their life is added to the human they saved.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> After the death of Raditz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, the readers/viewers learn that both Kami and Piccolo are aware that they are going to die in the next year when the other two Saiyans arrive. While Kami doesn't know the course of their deaths, he theorizes that this knowledge might have changed Piccolo's personality and status as a demon, which explains why Piccolo trains Gohan and does show him mercy. And indeed, Piccolo dies by sacrificing himself for Gohan, leading to Kami's death.
</li><li> When Krillin meets Grand Elder Guru, the latter reveals he has only a short amount of time to live. He does die because of his old age, but the progress was accelerated by Freeza's action. When the Grand Elder is revived by the Dragon Balls, he only gains the stolen lifespan back. But that's long enough for him to put his affairs in order, appointing his eldest son Tsuno as the new Grand Elder and ensuring that the Namek Dragon Balls would remain functional.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> In recent chapters of the newly revived manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em>, Satoshi has told Daisuke that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all members of the Hikari family die young, and he believes he's near his own death</span>.

While he's able to rescue Mamiya before his deadline, it seems as though Yuda, a fellow Nanto practitioner who held her captive and whom Rei wished to defeat to avenge her honor, would evade him before he died. Thankfully, Toki was able to give Rei one more day with his medical application of Hokuto Shinken.
<p></p></li><li> Due to the incredible strain of keeping the family in some sort of order, the heads of the Sohma family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> never live past thirty. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That's what, in fact, made Akito's father Akira an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy">Ill Boy</a>... and ultimately killed him. Akito shows signs of illness in the anime and that's her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, but in the manga, her bad health seems to come more from <em>deep</em> seated psychological problems, courtesy of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Manipulative Bitch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">mother</a>; when she gets better, the signs of illness seem to disappear.</span>

He knows he's gonna die soon of cancer due to breathing rocket fumes, and he's desperate to finish his project for the rocket in time.
<p></p></li><li> The 'players' in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em> have what is known as a BAD END: When their future-revealing diaries get an entry that reveals when they'll die, death is all but certain to occur at that point.

<ul><li> Wizards and Witches also have pre-emptive knowledge of when they're going to die, and thus tend to use this knowledge to put their affairs in order. Witches use it to make sure a replacement is found, bequeathing her personal items, making sure a grave is dug, and so on, while Wizards tend to commit credit fraud and drink themselves into a stupor. Both sides like to throw a good last party with their friends/colleagues as well.
<ul><li> To be specific, they are evidently forewarned about their imminent <em>natural</em> deaths. Just because they haven't sensed this trope in action doesn't mean they can't get themselves killed by doing something reckless or stupid, or be killed by somebody else who couldn't care less if they're bumping up the schedule.

</li><li> Also, at least one being on the Disc can ignore lifetimers at will - Death himself. In addition to the old trick of simply not collecting the dead in question, at one point Death turns over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mort</span>'s lifetimer, giving him extra time.

He manages to survive long enough to help Princess Bubblegum and her army to rescue Finn and Simon from GOLB before he dies, leaving only a seed in the shape of the Finn Sword behind. Finn uses the seed to plant a new tree with a restored Finn Sword around the remains of the destroyed treehouse.</span>
<p></p></li><li> Played with in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em> when BoJack tells Sarah Lynn, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">pseudo-daughter of around 30</a>, that she can't stay with him anymore and suggests she go to rehab. The exchange goes a little something like this:
<div class="indent"><strong>BoJack:</strong> I'm sorry Sarah Lynn, but you can't stay here anymore.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Sarah Lynn:</strong> Okay. I'll just text one of the billion people who will let me party at their house.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>BoJack:</strong> Well you should... not... do that.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Sarah Lynn:</strong> Oh, I know. I know, but I'm at a point in my life where I don't have to 'grow as a person' or 'rise to any occasions,' so I can just keep surrounding myself with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>BoJack:</strong> Whwhat?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Sarah Lynn:</strong> Yeah, it's pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">too late for me.</a>
</div><ul><li> Played straight with Herb, as we know he's going to die when we first meet him and it's revealed he has about six months to live. He gets his affairs in order. He asks Sarah Lynn to publish his manuscript after he dies, wanting his legacy to be something other than <em>Horsin' Around</em> (which she doesn't  not just because she was so high that she forgot, but also because everyone agreed it was horrible). His funeral episode reveals that he actually went into remission, however... The reason he died was because he was tweeting while driving and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">ran into a truck that was full of peanuts, of which he was allergic to</a>.
</li><li> Also played straight with Beatrice Horseman in Season 4, as she develops senile dementia and the doctors tell her son that she hasn't much time, if any, left. She dies not long before the events of Season 5 <em>Free Churro</em>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> This is a major plotpoint in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> film "Bender's Big Score." Lars, despite being in love with Leela, breaks up with her because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is actually a time paradox-created clone of Fry who went back in time and lived an additional 12 years in the past before returning to the 3000s. After learning from Professor Farnsworth that all the time paradox clones will die in order to correct history</span> he ended his relationship because he wanted her to be spared the grief of his eventual death. It comes to pass at the end of the movie when he dies via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
<p></p></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> episode has Grandpa Phil dreading his 81st birthday since his family is "cursed" to die at that exact age. Even though a doctor's check-up shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer">he's capable of bench-pressing more than 200lb.</a> he constantly talks about how he's doomed to die. The episode ends with Arnold pointing out that his relatives all died when they were <em>91</em>, meaning that Phil's at least got a good 10 years before he needs to start worrying.
<p></p></li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a></em>, George goes for his physical and, afterwards, the doctor tells him he's probably going to die soon and says if he has anything he's ever wanted to do, do it now. George takes advantage of this to finally tell off Mr. Spacely. Spacely is impressed enough by this display of fearlessness that he offers George the opportunity to be the test pilot for the indestructible jacket his company has designed. Just before the last test (where two missiles will be fired at him), the doctor tells him there was a mistake and he'll probably live to be 150.
<p></p></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, Dr. Orpheus is accidentally shot by Action Man.
