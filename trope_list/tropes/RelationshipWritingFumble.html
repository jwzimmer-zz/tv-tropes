</div></div><p>Most people, after reading enough fiction, begin to have an idea of how relationships begin to fit together, and can spot a budding romance a mile off. Sometimes, though, the writers break away from these conceptions and do something entirely unexpected. Normally, the writers figure out what the relationship between two people should be in a series, then they take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes">stock derivatives</a> and toss in cues to clue the viewer into how things are between those two people. When this trope crops up, however, it's usually the result of a writer breaking from the established relationship types and attempting to forge unusual bonds. To do this, they need to either re-use existing cues (and risk the viewer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">drawing the wrong conclusions</a>) or create new ones (and risk the viewer drawing the wrong conclusions). Although sometimes a writer will pull it off, it more often leaves people with the completely wrong impression.

This is about a writer fumbling their treatment of something that wasn't supposed to be a romantic relationship at all with the result that fans look at it and go "huh, seems like there's something there."

In the original, this is innocent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship">Big Brother Worship</a> due to her young age, but the remake ages her up and makes her actions seems rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext">flirtatious</a>. It ended up inspiring some parody videos, and even fanfiction, to play up the incest angle even further.
</li><li> A series of Renault Clio ads in the UK featured a pair of French people, a beautiful young woman named Nicole and a handsome old man—the viewer assumes from their ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> and the old stereotypes about French men that they're lovers, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> when the woman addresses him as "Papa". This doesn't dispel the sexual tension, though, and they just look like an incestuous pair. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> was asked about his role in Series 8 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, he reportedly was adamant that his relationship with the companion Clara had no sexual tension or flirting at all, requesting "no Papa-Nicole moments".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight">.hack//Legend of the Twilight</a></em>, particularly the anime adaptation, writes the brother and sister protagonists, Shugo and Rena, in a way that came across as incestuous to a lot of viewers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZeroSevenGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZeroSevenGhost">07-Ghost</a></em>: Teito and Mikage. Mikage tells Teito that he considers him to be as important as his own family (possibly meaning he considers Teito "family") before declaring "I love you, Teito." There's other suspect hints pointing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> as well. Such as Mikage's running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp">glomp</a> upon meeting Teito again (complete with sparkles) and sleeping in the same bed together in the first episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: During the period of Manga Chapters 92-93 several readers assumed Gabi had a crush on Reiner due to her blushing around him, constantly clinging to him, following him everywhere around, her insistence on holding his hand, and the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Falco</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">clearly seemed to be jealous of her behavior towards him</a>. But, chapter 94 revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that they're cousins</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>: Ciel and Sebastian have so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> that it's easy to forget they're only using one another for their personal goals (Ciel using Sebastian for revenge and Sebastian only helping him so he can eat his soul later). There are no real hints that indicate they care about each other as friends, or even fellow individuals, but their constant physical intimacy and dialogue has lead to fans shipping them together more than Ciel and his actual fiancee.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> reveals that this trope occurred between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a> members in the early chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>. The artist thought that Tomoyo had a crush on main character Sakura's older brother Touya, while the story writer actually meant for her to be in love with Sakura herself. When the artist found out her mistake, they quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> the instances of Tomoyo blushing around Touya to be due to Touya (specifically, Touya's ears) reminding her of Sakura. <a class="urllink" href="http://usomitai.livejournal.com/68511.html">CLAMP had a good laugh about this in a post-series interview.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> After the series ended, the staff used post-series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplementary materials</a> to answer the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">Ship-to-Ship Combat</a> between the fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Kallen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">C.C.</a> by saying that Lelouch viewed C.C. as an equal. The problem came when they implied that C.C. essentially used Lelouch for her own emotional satisfaction, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterConflictsWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterConflictsWithCanon">blatantly contradicts her actions throughout the series</a>, especially late in the series and in the final episode, where she's shown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">crying as he's assassinated, and happily speaking to his spirit in the final scene</span>. The issue seems to be put down to rest with the sequel film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassLelouchOfTheResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassLelouchOfTheResurrection">Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where C.C. resurrects Lelouch because she still has some unfinished business and admits to Kallen that it's indeed selfish of her to do it. Lelouch doesn't seem to mind about it and in the end, he chooses to join her in travelling around the world and names himself as L.L. which, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyMarriageProposal">Wacky Marriage Proposal</a> and C.C. happily accepts it</span>. But again, the <em>Resurrection</em> film is set in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> and there are fans who are dubious with its canonicity.
</li><li> Kallen with Gino. A few scenes throughout the show seemed to establish a relatively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">friendly rivalry</a> between them, plus Gino's backstory from the official novels said that he had a crush on his family's Eleven maid, all seemingly an attempt to set up an eventual relationship. However, they just didn't interact enough to properly develop it, with the overall result looked more like Gino went from viewing Kallen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> to having a crush on her, but Kallen herself never visibly reciprocated. Considering that Kallen's focal relationship was supposed to be between Lelouch and herself, then Gino's advances falling short might be intentional.

This was also the plan for <em>02</em> until <em>Our War Game!</em> complicated this, because writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruHosoda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruHosoda">Mamoru Hosoda</a> was unaware of the intended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> and laid the Sora and Taichi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> thick in the movie. When Sora began dating Yamato in <em>02</em>, many people were confused at the sudden change in love interest. Even the voice actors expressed surprise at this.

In the English dub, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> between Sora and Yamato seemed even more random and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">out-of-nowhere</a>. Apparently, Jeff Nimoy, who was in charge of the English dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">shipped Taichi with Sora</a>, and thus the script changes made the dialogue look like Tai had a longtime crush on Sora while making the friendly conversations between Yamato and Sora rather awkward and even hostile at times.

<ul><li> At this point, in the middle of sequel <em>Exodus</em> and after over a decade since the original series, it is questionable wether it was this trope or intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>. Kazuki is still as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessChickMagnet">oblivious</a> as ever and the series has not let up on the undertones.

<ul><li> Probably the most unfortunate case is with Ed and Al, who seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext">a lot more devoted to and obsessed with each other</a> than merely <em>brotherly</em> affection would suggest.

And then they fight alongside each other, completely ignoring Riza and Winry.
</li><li> There's also the intense fixation that Alfons Heiderich—Al's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> counterpart—has with Ed.

Physical Contact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> Masashi Ikeda, the director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, said in an interview that he didn't intend a romantic relationship between main characters Heero Yuy and Relena Peacecraft, considering the political and symbolic relationship between the two to be much more important than a romantic relationship. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirls</a> love to hold this interview up as "proof" that Heero is gay to support their shipping him with Duo Maxwell. However, they completely ignore a few <em>other</em> things Ikeda said, like the fact that he considered <strong>all</strong> romance in the series ancillary to the overall plot, that he considers himself horrible at writing male-female relationships, and, most importantly, that just because Heero and Relena become a couple in the series doesn't mean that it'll never happen at all; Ikeda even admitted that he could see easily them getting together once their lives have settled down. This is further aided by the fact that every official sidestory has a strong emphasis on Heero and Relena's romantic attraction to one another, and that most of the cast (including Duo himself) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">tries to get them to admit their feelings for each other</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then the sequel novel <em>Frozen Teardrop</em>, written by the anime's head writer, follows through on Ikeda's assertion and sees Heero and Relena getting married at the end.</span>
</li><li> Likewise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, where the writers intended a romance between protagonist Shinn Asuka and teammate Lunamaria Hawke. Unfortunately, Luna only ever acted as a sort of sister figure to Shinn while openly crush on returning character Athrun Zala. In fact, they never hook up until Athrun (and Luna's sister Meyrin) are apparently killed (by Shinn!), the whole thing coming off more like survivor's guilt. And then in post-series interviews, the director called Shinn and Luna's relationship the only "pure" one in the whole show. The directors' claim could come from the films' compilations which expanded the relationship between Shinn and Luna making them the only couple that starts in the series. Meanwhile, most of publications by Sunrise state that Athrun was just Luna's idol and there was not love.
<ul><li> Speaking of Athrun, we've got his train wreck of a relationship with Cagalli. Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> he rejoins ZAFT and ends up having to fight Kira (again). When he finally pulls his head out of his ass, it looks like Cagalli has forgive him, but by the series end both are giving off very mixed signals. The movie may have been meant to correct this, but at this rate they won't finish it until G.R.R. Martin finishes A Song of Ice and Fire.

The whole series develops a relationship between protagonist Kou Uraki and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a> Nina Purpleton, and it does this well enough.

The only foreshadowing viewers are given is an extremely brief scene in the first episode where Nina seems to recognize Gato, but it could easily be written off as her just having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment. This moment, combined with her early abrasiveness and seemingly valuing machines over people, has made Nina one of <em>Gundam</em>'s biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappies</a>.

</li><li> And while we're at it, let's talk about Amuro Ray, the <em>original</em> Gundam hero. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> he has a vague romance with Sayla Mass which is thrown off when he meets his apparent soulmate Lalah Sune (who he then kills accidentally). In the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em>, he got a new love interest, Beltorchika Irma. Unfortunately, she became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> in record time, so much so that fans ignore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">other characters (including Amuro) calling her on it</a>, or her later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Char's Counterattack</a></em>, Amuro got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman">Disposable Woman</a>, Chein Agi, whose relevance to the plot was basically nil. A good bit of this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a> since Sayla's actress was unable to return for <em>Zeta</em>, and was ultimately only able a small cameo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Gundam ZZ</a></em> (the series in which Amuro <em>doesn't</em> appear) before the actress died.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> averted this somewhat in his novelizations, having Amuro and Sayla hook up in the original series novels, but the relationship is screwed up because Sayla is fixated on protecting the family name and begs Amuro to kill her brother right after they finish having sex. He wrote an alternate version of <em>Char's Counterattack</em> where Beltorchika is still around and is in fact pregnant with Amuro's child, but this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">a novel based on the anime based on his first novel</a>.

Kyoko, a character Tsuna heavily reminds the reader from the very first chapter that he is in love with, is someone he rarely ever speaks to, and it has been revealed that the main reason he even likes her is because she was the first girl in a year to have spoken to him, yet he is willing to lay down his life for her even when they barely knew each other.

</li><li> Many fans assumed Shikamaru and Ino, and to a lesser extent Chouji and Ino, were supposed to have something going on.

</li><li> There is a moment when Naruto meets his mother for the first time and fawns over her being attractive. It's supposed to be cute familial praising, but his <em>wording</em> is awkward. The English dub fixes this by making Naruto sound more platonic.

Luffy, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Hero</a> by default, nosebleeds after having seen a naked Nami, but he is not affected at all by witnessing the much more buxom Boa Hancock in that same state of undress (who is also nothing short of head over heels in love with him!). Oda's explanation for this? Something along the lines of "Luffy only acts this way around Usopp, who is a bad influence". That is not a very convincing reasoning.

Their relationship <em>does</em> often come off as romantic though, be it unrequited Ash's side or not. They have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> type friendship throughout the Original Series and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Misty has shown jealousy</a> towards girls' behavior around Ash (especially in the second movie). This was not at all helped by American dub writers leaning into the pairing, with a music CD released in America after the show started picking up popularity featuring a song sung from Misty's perspective that flat-out says she loves Ash, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0c0a5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0c0a5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0c0a5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the Christmas album, if you're wondering</span>. The American-produced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PokemonLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PokemonLive">Pokémon Live!</a></em> musical also featured a romance between them.
</li><li> In later seasons, Zoey and Dawn had a noticeable fumble early on as Zoey constantly appears to be flirting with Dawn (especially in the Japanese version). Dawn's reactions don't help (blushing in response in one instance), and neither does the "Prince and Princess" motif of their Contest clothing. Numerous fans thought that they were intentionally writing in a lesbian pairing, or at least a heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">Hide Your Lesbians</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a> case), as their dynamic is very similar to their predecessors May and Drew (who have <em>did</em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>). Later episodes toned it down into Zoey being Dawn's mentor.
</li><li> Possibly Ash and <em>both</em> his companions in <em>Best Wishes,</em> Iris and Cilan. The former, mostly from their rivalry and from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotMandatedFriendshipFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotMandatedFriendshipFailure">Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure</a> episode coming off like two lovers with broken hearts, and another episode involving them going on a day out on the town without Cilan, doing things together that don't involve Pokemon. Cilan and Ash's Pokemon pushing Ash to get back with her makes them all seem like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">they ship it.</a> Ash and Cilan get this with Cilan's very campy nature and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">Hero Worship</a> of Ash, which often comes off as obsessive or romantic. The three were actually a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome">OT3</a>.
</li><li> There's a reason why non-shippers often joke that Pikachu is the only person Ash could ever love. Their friendship is incredibly strong and the focal point of a lot of the series. It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">more than a few Pokemon canonically like Ash</a>.

The closest scene was Jessie blushing when James was on top of her in "Training Daze" (and that happened early in their friendship, so you can argue she lost any attraction over time).

You can guess how well that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">didn't work.</a></em> The problem?
<ul><li> Akari was introduced in the last 4 volumes and had almost no development or personality traits beyond her obsession with pigs. So she was widely seen as a shallow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup">johnny-come-lately</a>, whose only purpose was to instantly fall in love with Ryoga simply because he defeated her pet sumo pig Katsunishki, and because Ryoga's cursed form was a black piglet. Thus, seeming like a consolation prize for him.
</li><li> Konatsu had it worse, since his feelings toward Ukyo remained one-sided because her heart was set firmly on Ranma. Aside from that, Konatsu's presence in the series amounted to a single story of his own and a one-panel cameo in the final story, so fans didn't see the point.

It begins with Rumi overhearing Tsubaki telling Bossun that he does not consider Rumi as his little sister, leaving her in a bad mood.

Its unknow if Venom's creator Davi Michelinie intended it to be romantic, but in Venom's second arc, there's a psychologist that describes the symbiote's feelings for Peter as similar to romantic and Peter tries to convince it into leaving Eddie by undressing himself. And this doesn't stop, by now, plenty of other writers not only have hinted it as being romantic but state it, having Eddie describe his bond with the symbiote as something beyond marriage or the symbiote describing their first bonding in the church to be similar marriage. Even writers who want to write their bond as toxic still keep the romantic overtones in some way or form.

But the writer of the books and comics (who only worked on the movie as a consultant) said no. Kiina was just worried about Berix's wellbeing because she's one of the good guys, but other than that, can't stand him. And they also belong to different species—not that that kept Kiina from falling for Mata Nui, who was technically an artificial being, in the sequel novel.

The film climaxes with the two of them sharing a duet in the final music number—and they're shown writing to each other at the end. This is already after the colossal ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a> between them in the first film. If that wasn't enough, in the final post-<em>Rainbow Rocks</em> short 'Friendship Through the Ages', Twilight plays a piano with Sunset sitting on it. The latter then extends her hand to dance, but instead, Twilight gently strokes Sunset's arm. There's also classical music playing in the back, which gives this a romantic undertone. In a deleted scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Friendship Games</a></em>, Sunset is pouring out her emotions to Twilight about keeping the magic under control when she hasn't done so with the other five and is in despair. What does Twilight do? She places her hands on Sunset's while smiling at her and telling her she is free to come to Equestria whenever she feels like it. And, in the actual movie, Sunset is constantly thinking about Twilight, as if one's partner wasn't responding to calls.
</li><li> The Human Twilight and Sunset aren't free from this either.

Every subsequent adaptation tends to be ambiguous about it; the 1977 feature film has their duet, 'Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers', comes off as heavily romantic, with Andy stroking her hand, hugging her from behind, and a weird segment where he's hidden under her apron(!).

Even the films' writers fumbled mid-sentence, describing their relationship as a "love story" before quickly calling them brothers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Like their comic counterpart, there's Cap and Tony. They spend most of their time bickering, Tony rants about him behind his back, Cap challenges him to 'go a few rounds', but when shit hits the fan, those two go together to fix the engine and work together surprisingly well. Basically, it feels like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> kind of relationship more than a pseudo-sibling rivalry like intended.
</li><li> Tony and Bruce, though possibly intended. Tony is the only one who doesn't treat Bruce like a timebomb, even playfully teasing him and trying to get him to open up, gushes about how awesome the Hulk is, while Banner seems to listen to him and is the only person who isn't annoyed by his antics, then later saves his life as the Hulk.
</li><li> Clint and Natasha. Natasha is unendingly loyal to Clint and wants to save him from Loki so much she at one point offers to free him in exchange for freeing Clint, while he seems to know more about her than anyone else. There wasn't anything explicitly romantic about them, but they're depicted as so close that they're the most popular Het couple in the fandom. Oddly, it's partly because Natasha <em>never</em> flirts with him that they seemed like they could be romantic. Until you find out they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">especially when Clint's wife is introduced.</span>

The two spend most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">The Winter Soldier</a></em> working together, and develop a very strong bond with moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfDistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfDistraction">Kiss of Distraction</a>. Future films also show them clearly to be very close. Once again, the very underdeveloped nature of Caps canon romance with Sharon is partially to blame, as its hard to ignore that theres a female ally whom Cap has far more chemistry and interactions with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>, Valkyrie was made into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">black</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoferTokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoferTokenMinority">bisexual</a> whose female lover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had been killed protecting her</span>. She and Thor were intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a> who never pursue a romance because Val was still in mourning, but the scene establishing that was cut from the film. Instead, their onscreen relationship comes off as sexual tension that never goes anywhere. Even if the writers just wanted to show a man and woman as platonic friends, they still went out of their way to inform us that Thor is now single, and then he encounters a beautiful female warrior of similar age and background and rouses her out of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> slump. Thor and Val arguably had better chemistry than most of the <em>actual</em> romances in the MCU.

On the final cycle of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>, Sam's confrontation with Lindsay is also far more emotional than the one with Kent.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">the book</a> it's made clear that Tommy only saw Carrie as a friend and was taking her to the prom as a favor to Sue. The film doesn't really explain why he's kissing Carrie — since he's basically cheating on Sue. This is probably why both remakes go out of their way to say that Tommy only sees Carrie as a friend.
</li><li> Also in the DePalma version, there's an awful lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> between Carrie and Coach Collins, the only teacher who likes her. Collins' actress Betty Buckley stated she intended to portray her as a lesbian, but never specified whether she was supposed to be attracted to Carrie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2002">Carrie (2002)</a></em> really amps up the amount of scenes between Carrie and Sue, to the point that it almost seems like Sue is interested in her. And Sue also makes a throwaway joke about her and Carrie having a lesbian affair.

This is especially apparent after Andy's make over, where Miranda checks her from head to toe and proceeds to stare at her as she walks away. Meanwhile Andy goes from complaining about Miranda behind her back to repeatedly gushing about her to people, and breaks things off with Christian immediately after finding out the plan to replace Miranda. This gets lampshadesd by both Emily, "Why didn't you just climb into bed with her", and Andy's actual love interest Nate, "The person who's calls you always take. That's the relationship you're in".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>: There is a ridiculous amount of apparent romantic subtext between Ender and his sister Valentine, to the point that she's appearing in his mind games as the princess that he has to rescue from a castle, and she's the one that Graff turns to in order to convince Ender to return to the Battle School after he suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>.

Instead, they dwelled on how Ben Grimm, friends with Reed since childhood, helped him reach the scholarship he'd always dreamed of, how Ben (and not Reed's parents) helped Reed move into the Baxter Foundation, how Reed could not consider deploying the teleporter without Ben there, the list goes on. The emotional peak of the movie is when Reed abandons Ben (specifically Ben) in a government facility to save himself from being experimented on... and Ben's reaction is not that unlike a scorned lover. Deleted drafts of the script had Ben consider enlisting in the army once he realizes Reed is moving on with his life and forgetting him. Uh...

There is a large group of fans who did not read the books and just watched the movies who were certain that Harry and Hermione were going to end up together. Which is not to say that there are no Harry/Hermione shippers among the fans of the books, see the Literature section for more info. The films' head writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves">Steve Kloves</a>, while reading the books, thought Harry and Hermione would end up together and told J.K.

As a result, the fact that she's <em>faking</em> a romantic attraction to Peeta during this installment of the movie series for the benefit of the crowd and her own survival doesn't come through fully. By the end of the movie, it looks like a genuine romance between the two instead of the initially tragic one-sided relationship of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">the books</a>. The love story is made to seem like it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">between Katniss and Gale, with Peeta and her public fake-romance with him being an obstacle to overcome</span> while in the books, it's actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a love story between Katniss and Peeta, with Gale only in the mix for a triangle that never really kicks off and lasts only through the first half of the second book</span>.

For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesCatchingFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesCatchingFire">the second film</a>, the filmmakers chose to add relationship bits between Katniss and one guy and remove a lot of relationship bits between her and the other guy — presumably in order to milk more out of the love triangle concept and even things out between the boys. Consequently, many people who have only seen the films and not read the books, including several film critics, believe that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gale is Katniss' boyfriend</span> when in actuality <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's her male friend who feels unrequited love for her</span>.

Including a scene where Rosie orders Carter to dress her for bed. Also due to how short of a time they have known each other, it's easy to read their latter bonding moments as flirty. Piticularly the scene where they are trying on dresses or the one with them in front of the mirror. In the latter Rosie is very close to Carter from behind, and basically tells her she's beautiful, before placing a crown on Carter's head. There's also the burping scene which features the two on a swing and opening up to each other, which seems straight out of a romance story. Plus the <a class="urllink" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=koSYNaMNp0E">extended ending<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the two become agents together and end up slow walking down the beach together.

</li><li> The 2018 film <em>Red Joan</em> is about an elderly woman being outed as a Cold War spy - who first became one by entering a romance with a Soviet agent.

Layla cries on the shoulder of school bad boy Warren, who has his own reasons for disliking Will, and the two decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy">pretend to date to cheese him off</a>. They have a number of cute scenes and even go to Homecoming together and by all appearances have a good time before the party is crashed by the bad guys. Will only learns Layla likes him in the last fifteen minutes (from Warren, no less) and just sort of realizes he likes her back without much buildup. This may or may not have been intentional; the film was originally planned as the first in a series of four, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to one of the writers on IMDB</a>, Will and Layla wouldn't have lasted and she'd have "officially" gotten with Warren.

The rest of the potentially romantic subtext between the characters remains unaddressed. Needless to say, some fans found the films resolution of the romance angle confusing and underbaked.

(Bonus points for the fact that both the boys go swimming in the pool together at one point.) It's worth noting that the company that made this movie also specializes in explicitly homoerotic films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenBeachMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenBeachMovie">Teen Beach Movie</a> 2</em>: Lela and Mack are supposed to be friends and straight with boyfriends. However Lela begins the movie basically ignoring her boyfriend Tanner and seemingly pinning over Mack. When she finds Mack's necklace, Lela readily abandons her whole life, including Tanner if he hadn't followed, just to see her again. When first arriving in the real world, she's overly excited to wear Mack's clothes and model for her, while acting like a teenage girl in front of her crush. Lela hangs out with Mack to the point that Tanner gets jealous, and then refuses to leave her new life and seemingly Mack behind. Lela ends the film by throwing Mack her jacket and winking at her. For Mack's part, she seems starstruck when she sees Lela look "normal" for the first time, with her mouth hanging open. She encourages Lela to rewrite the movie, and in the alternate timeline is obsessed with the movie <em>Lela, Queen of the Beach</em> even more than Brady was with <em>Wet Side Story</em>.
</li><li> During the wedding in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Breaking Dawn Part 1</a></em>, some thought the dance between Bella and Jacob looked more natural with more connection and romance than the dance between Bella and Edward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>: There is rather a lot of affection between Dorothy and the Scarecrow. Most notable is the goodbye scene where she saves him for last and says, "I think I'll miss you most of all," — though nothing comes of it. This is partly due to a dropped plot point — where the film would have ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a> scenario between Dorothy and Huck (the Scarecrow's human counterpart). But since Dorothy is meant to be only twelve or fourteen in the film, it's quite possible this is just a platonic pairing.

She follows him around like a schoolgirl with a crush — which she is, as it's mentioned at one point later that she's actually "taken with him" — tells him that she wants to live her life on the road with him in the beginning, she walks into his bedroom at night, they hug, he goes after her and does everything he can to save her, he embraces her again and sticks his face to hers when she's unconscious so that he could give her his life force and, in the end, she tells him that she doesn't want him to leave, so he gives her his dog tags as a memory of him, which she keeps until his return. In fact, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">the second film</a>, Rogue's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest">Designated Love Interest</a> Bobby actually picks up on this and is clearly jealous of Wolverine.

It's worth noting that the comic-book version of Wolverine's childhood featured a significant redhead named Rose as his first love interest. The first scenes in the movie are copied almost directly from the comic, except with a young Sabretooth in Rose's place.

Meanwhile, Ari has a tragic backstory, is hopelessly corrupted, has a reunion with Max after many years, and Max constantly has dreams about him. If not for the film going on to express in a more obvious way that Ari resented Max, it might have run its course before viewers realized it wasn't going to be a love triangle. Even more awkward, it turns out that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">the books</a> most of the characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> are genetically related in some way due to being lab rats, including Max and Fang.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> insists that she was never trying to imply Neville/Luna, despite plenty of background moments between the two that can easily be interpreted in a cute shippy way (they stare at each other on the train, at one point she helps him into a chair...). This apparently was enough for them to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">sorta-paired up</a> in the movies.

The problem also stems from Rowling's choice to write the series entirely from Harry's perspective; we see a lot of Harry's interactions with Hermione, Ron and both, and since Hermione is the girl that Harry spends the most time with by far and they never come across as anything but friendly and amicable, it is natural to see Hermione as the love interest. Conversely, readers never get to see how Ron and Hermione interact with each other one on one <em>when Harry is not around</em>, where a lot of their relationship's development would tend to happen. (Eventually, Rowling herself admitted that while writing the last book, Harry and Hermione were coming across as a potential couple due to these factors.)

Then Tonks rather abruptly declares at the end of the sixth book that she's in love with Lupin when everyone assumed she was grieving over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sirius's death</span>, and Lupin's initial reaction of calling himself "too old and too broken" for her (as well as implying he'd either been aware of her feelings for some time and was dodging the issue or had already rejected her once before) and as being seemingly all too willing to ditch Tonks and their newborn son to go on an adventure with Harry, Ron and Hermione, which Harry himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls him out on,</a> still had some convinced that Lupin really didn't reciprocate her feelings and just went along with it because the other Order of the Phoenix members (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Arthur and Molly</a> pressured him into it and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sirius was dead</span>.

So close, in fact, that Ward's younger brother gets jealous. The fact that it is the brother, not the love interest, who is jealous, is probably meant to imply that the relationship is more sibling-like. However, fandom concludes that love interest is not jealous because she is a cool, relaxed lady, and just... ship her with Ward and Oreg as threesome. Just as in LOTR this is merely a matter of interpretation of affectionate gestures, though unlike Tolkien the author is cool with homosexuality and may have decided to just not care <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles">what readers might read into it.</a>

It's possible the implication of her descent from him was simply an oversight, or Steven being mistaken — it's also possible that Dodo and Steven's relationship was more familial as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> seems to exist mostly in other peoples' heads and Dodo's strange behaviour in "The Gunfighters" can be explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">her being strange anyway</a> — but it's unlikely that both of these were supposed to be true at the same time.
</li><li> Polly doesn't generally appear to have interest in anyone, but she calls the Doctor 'gorgeous' in one throwaway scene in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E8TheFacelessOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E8TheFacelessOnes">The Faceless Ones</a>", and when she leaves the TARDIS, the Doctor tells Ben to keep working hard and Polly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">look after Ben</a>, implying that they are romantically involved (as well as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">alarmingly sexist by modern standards</a>).
</li><li> Whether Jo is the Third Doctor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a> tormenting the audience with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a>, or whether she's a surrogate daughter figure, depends entirely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">what works for that particular story</a>.
</li><li> At least for the latter's first few appearances, the relationship between the Doctor and the Master was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">far too amiable</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>. As mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a>, their respective actors were good friends and this entered into their performances, but most appearances from the 1980s onwards extrapolated this into straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> — eventually heterosexual when the Master regenerated into a woman.
</li><li> Notorious real-life flirt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> was prone to sizing up female costars which his character was presumably intended to have no interest in. Bettan in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks">Genesis of the Daleks</a>" is a nice, helpful female character whose job is to show up for about ten minutes to help the Doctor get back to his companions, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> between them is distracting.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance">abusive relationship</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> subtext between Styggron and Crayford in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion">The Android Invasion</a>" deserves a mention. Styggron is intended as an obsessive control freak who has no interest in anything besides his convoluted plan, and it was supposed to be him manipulating Crayford for these ends and then abandoning him. Unfortunately, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">gibberish-level convolution of his plan</a> means that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">Gaslighting</a> of Crayford comes across as abuse for its own sake. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> scenes added by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes">Robert Holmes</a> add a whole subplot where Styggron straps down Crayford to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam">Agony Beam</a> scanner to psychologically torture him by creating and destroying a robot duplicate in front of him, which makes Crayford's later obsessive devotion to him come off as inexplicable, unless he's emotionally codependent. The Doctor eventually has to talk Crayford into realising that Styggron's been lying to him about who he really is, which Crayford plays in the manner of someone finally realising the truth about an abusive husband.
</li><li> The Doctor and Leela. Their relationship has a bigger power dynamic differential than most Doctor/companion relationships, with Leela being his student and, to a certain extent, his creation. Their relationship was intended to be more distant and vertical than with Sarah Jane, a carry-over from the Third Doctor era who didn't quite fit the Fourth Doctor's alienness. None of it stops the Doctor checking her out in pretty dresses and trying to grope her thighs or sniff her hair while hiding with her in doorways.
</li><li> The Doctor and K-9 were supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>. Early in K-9's run, Tom Baker plays it more like the Doctor sincerely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">hates</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotDog">Robot Dog</a> and is only tolerating him because he's useful. Check out "Underworld", where he outright <em>snarls</em> at K-9's unhelpful comments, and plays the scene where he has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">talk about K-9 being his best friend</a> slightly mockingly, as if he's buttering up K-9 for favours.
</li><li> Romana was a very attractive woman (in both of her incarnations) and a Time Lord like the Doctor, thus removing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a> issue entirely. She was his intellectual equal, and thus the usual mentoring overtones of his relationships with most other companions were absent and they came across more as (possibly romantic) partners. Tom Baker and Lalla Ward had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet">rather volatile real-life romantic relationship</a> during their run on the show adding a large dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">Reality Subtext</a> as well, which resulted in some Relationship Acting Fumble. In some episodes they come across as ridiculously in love and are clearly turning each other on a lot with their presence — and in others they won't even look at each other and stumble through their lines in a contemptuous monotone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that one can sometimes tell if the actors had had a falling out by how they interacted on screen.
</li><li> During the Fifth Doctor's run, there was a no touching rule between the Doctor and his female companions to dispel the notion that he could be having a sexual relationship with either of them. It just made fans think he was having one with the token <em>male</em> companion of the time, who wasn't subject to those restrictions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a> noticed this himself during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>, musing that Turlough was created so that the Doctor would have someone he could "put his arm around".
</li><li> The rather 1980s belief that physical contact between the same gender <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic">wouldn't be interpreted sexually</a> meant that fans instead latched onto female companions Tegan and Nyssa, two characters who, despite the infinite dimensions of the TARDIS, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">feel the need to share a bedroom</a>. When Tegan rejoins the crew in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E1ArcOfInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E1ArcOfInfinity">Arc of Infinity</a>", Nyssa gives a whoop of delight and hugs her, while the Doctor looks like he'd rather be somewhere else. Out of sequence recording didn't help: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahSutton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahSutton">Sarah Sutton</a> and Janet Fielding were asked to tone down their chemistry since they were coming across as <em>very</em> close in only Tegan's second story.
</li><li> The Fifth Doctor and Susan are also widely noted to have looked like they were checking each other out in their scenes together. Possibly a bit hard to play a convincing grandfather-granddaughter relationship with a ten-year age difference in the wrong direction.
<ul><li> In the same story, there's a whole scene where the <strong>First</strong> Doctor appears to be checking out his granddaughter's arse that was so gobsmackingly overt that reruns cut it out.
</li></ul></li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">The End of Time</a>", Naismith and his daughter seem to have a <em>lot</em> of sexual tension going on, almost to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squick</a>. Since the show is still aimed at kids, and the UST has no bearing on the plot whatsoever, it just comes across as random.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> loves exploring the murky territory between familial love, sexual love, and different familial roles, usually via time travel. While a small vocal minority still insists that he's in favour of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Wife Husbandry</a>, it's usually tasteful, and he's won awards for stories focusing on these themes more than a couple of times (see: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E4TheGirlInTheFireplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E4TheGirlInTheFireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>", about the Doctor's protection of a little girl as she grew causing her adult self to fall in love with him; and "Listen", where time travel accidents cause Clara to meet her boyfriend's child self, her boyfriend's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">Identical Grandson</a>, and the child self of the Doctor). But it's very unlikely he would have had the Doctor, Amy and Rory all flirting with each other so much if he'd known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">where their arc would end up going</a>. Or the parts where River appears to flirt with Amy. Even after he knew <em>exactly</em> what he was doing, he was still pushing the sexual angle between Amy and the Doctor hard, by repeatedly implying for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> reasons that Amy's baby was the Doctor's.
</li><li> The Doctor and Clara Oswald. As soon as they get together as a team, there's near-constant subtext about their friendship not being in a brotherly-sisterly realm, despite its platonic nature. The Doctor reluctantly (if happily) shows signs of having a chaste crush on Clara, largely because she's given him a new sense of purpose after he was very withdrawn from the world prior to befriending her. This is not helped by Clara, cheeky as she often is, taking him by the shoulder in episodes like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E9Hide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E9Hide">Hide</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E11TheCrimsonHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E11TheCrimsonHorror">The Crimson Horror</a>" or making him shyly squirm over minor gestures of affection. Jenna Coleman herself noted that Clara had grown to really like him, but it wasn't until his regeneration in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor">The Time of the Doctor</a>" that she (belatedly) realised she was a little bit in love with him as well. Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> begging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> not to write the relationship between Clara and his more morose incarnation as romantic (at least, so the claim has been made; this has since been denied), theirs is an intense bond, complete with long anguished looks at each other and a flat-out (if veiled) love declaration. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of season 9, the Doctor subjects himself to billions of years of torture to undo her death, shoots another Time Lord (with a gun!!) to escape with her, and then uses tech to lobotomize his memories of her as the only possible way of letting her go.</span>

</div></li><li> Though opinion is divided (as plenty of viewers strongly dislike this pairing), the relationship between Tom and Mary on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> can come across as the two of them acting like a married couple after the deaths of their respective spouses. They're brother and sister-in-law (Tom's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">late wife Sybil</span> is Mary's sister) and each get new love interests over the course of the show — but Tom and Mary often spend nearly every waking moment together, are able to communicate without words, are the missing mother/father figure to the other's child, and have an understanding of each other that goes beyond what anyone else in the show has. When Tom becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMatchmaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMatchmaker">The Matchmaker</a> to Mary and her latest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, most of his heartfelt speeches about why Mary should be with Henry are phrased in such a way that some fans feel like Tom is talking about <em>himself</em> (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7y2b-ndeqs">as with this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), viewing it as though it's all part of a desperate attempt to fight his own feelings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em>: Ted and Dougal are attempting to write lyrics for an entry for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurosong</a>. Dougal's first suggestion for lyrics for a song called "My Lovely Horse" is "My lovely horse I want to hold you so tight/ I want to rub my fingers through your tail and love you all night." When Ted points out that the lyrics should be about being best friends with the horse, not about being in love with the horse, Dougal proposes "Take this lump of sugar, baby, you know you want it."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009">Flash Forward</a></em> features a gay couple on their first date discussing getting married, having children, and saying things like 'I'd never leave you'. That doesn't happen the first time you go out for dinner (although, Janis does end up being put-off by the obsessiveness that her date ultimately displays). Furthermore, Janis has more chemistry with Demetri (who has a fiancee, with whom he has not a terrible amount of chemistry) than with the aforementioned date.
</li><li> Several viewers thought that Tyrion had romantic feelings for Sansa in Season 8 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> and some felt Sansa may even have reciprocated them to a degree. Tyrion expresses admiration for Sansa and states they "should've stayed married", to which Sansa says it wouldn't work "because of the dragon queen" without giving any other explanation. Sansa also makes a point of telling him that of all the men she was betrothed/married to, he was the best. And then there's their emotionally charged moment while they're hiding in the crypts and could be killed at any moment. It doesn't help that Tyrion previously admitted to finding Sansa attractive but refused to act on it on moral principle. However, given Tyrion's later confession that he's in love with Daenerys, the writers apparently didn't intend for him to have romantic interest in Sansa.
<ul><li> Jon and Sansa's relationship is also supposed to be a cute sibling one, but some fans saw it as them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Kissing Cousins</a> instead, especially with Jon being extremely protective of Sansa after they reunited and threatening every man who mentions her (Littlefinger, Theon, Tyrion) and only Sansa's presence is able to calm him down during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ramsay Bolton</span>. Sansa also becomes very close with Jon after not even sharing scenes with him in Season One, taking care to dress him as a Stark, talking about what a great man he is and gently touching his arm or face, etc.

In an attempt to "fix" the mistakes from the sixth season, Logan doesn't even end up with Rory, while Luke and Lorelai finally get together in the finale — yet it feels more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup">Last Minute Hookup</a> for some.
</li><li> Jess and Rory. They had a very popular relationship in Season 3 that ended because of issues between the characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> bad-timing, and Jess's spin-off (which was later cancelled). They continued to harbour feelings for each other and when Rory was going through a confused, unfocused time during Season 6, Jess briefly returns to the series as a guy who's grown up, worked through his rebellious phase, and has successfully published a novel. Jess won over more viewers when he encouraged Rory to get her life back on track, go back to Yale, and patch things back up with her now-estranged mom, who Rory was really close with.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5qxat');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5qxat" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5qxat');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At this point in the series, Rory gave up her studies after being told by a leading newspaper CEO and journalist that she doesn't have the skills to be a journalist — the goal and dream Rory had spent her life working toward.

Rory and Logan are having an affair while being involved with other people, which fans argued was out of character for both of them, particularly following Logan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in the original series and made both characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">Unintentionally Unsympathetic</a>. Jess and Rory get less than five minutes of screen time together and are friends now despite their heartbreaking last scene in the original series without much of a backstory to connect these dots over the last decade since we saw them together. The writers revive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> plots for both Jess/Rory and Rory/Logan literally <em>minutes</em> from the end. Luke and Lorelai are having the same issues with their relationship they were having in the original series — despite the nine year time jump — during which they've been in a committed relationship and living together. They do eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tie the knot</span>, but not before teasing a break-up for nearly an entire 90-minute episode.

When these two meet episodes before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> and before viewers knew they were even remotely related, it was believed these two might get together... in a very <em>non</em> platonic way — but it was revealed that any romantic dynamic some fans saw was entirely unintentional. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that they are related, writers backed away from Claire and Peter's initial dynamic pretty quickly. The big problems with Peter and Claire were 1) They had excellent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> reasons to be thrilled to meet each other, and the fandom interpreted it as the start of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a>, 2) they were both introduced as young, hot characters with the same questions about their powers, and 3) because the show hadn't revealed that they were related yet, people started shipping Claire and Peter right away.

Charlie intends the protagonist of the eponymous play to be a man in love with a princess who has his soul corrupted by the Nightman, a demon he battles against. However, he's initially named the Little Boy and certainly doesn't look or act like he's meant to be a grown man, adding an unintended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile">pedophilic undertone</a> to the princess's duet with him. On top of this, while intended as nonsexual, the Nightman taking his soul is laden with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a>; the scene features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack">Fade to Black</a> as the Nightman creeps under his covers, and Frank's character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">keeps mispronouncing</a> "boy's soul" as "boy's hole" — even the actors involved thought they were staging a rape scene.

<ul><li> Arthur and Morgana behave like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepSiblings">Flirty Step Siblings</a>, with lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>. In series two, the writers immediately backed off, leery about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> implications and the need to justify the increasingly marginalized Gwen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">upgrading her to love interest</a> for Arthur. But the third season has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that Morgana is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Uther's biological daughter and Arthur's half-sister</span>, throwing past Arthur/Morgana interactions into a whole new light. In the most of the well-known versions of Arthurian legend, Mordred is their son, not a kid who they rescue together, and in all of <em>those</em> they're usually brother and sister. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">Mordred generally turns out</a> to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">Bastard Bastard</a> and attempts to get revenge on Arthur as a morality tale against out-of-wedlock relationships and incest.)
</li><li> In the first season of the show, before Arthur got roped into a for-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, most of the fans thought that Arthur/Merlin was a legitimate thing, what with the long poignant gazes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>, and the Slash Dragon saying things like "A half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole" every two seconds. Consider the following dialogue between Merlin and his mother:
<div class="indent"><strong>Hunith:</strong> He must care for you a great deal. <br/><strong>Merlin:</strong> Arthur'd do the same for any village. That's just the way he is. <br/><strong>Hunith:</strong> It's more than that. He's here for you. <br/><strong>Merlin:</strong> I'm just his servant. <br/><strong>Hunith:</strong> Give him more credit than that. He likes you.
</div></li><li> While the respective actors of Arthur and Gwen have great friendship chemistry, but the moment she starts being all "I believe in you, Arthur," and he's all "I love you, but we can never be together," the whole scene starts reading like cardboard. Bradley James has said himself that when he's kissing Angel Coulby, it's very mechanical. Of course, this was a fumble that couldn't really be avoided, what with them being Arthur and Guinevere and making the move to have Gwen <em>not</em> be an arranged marriage princess.
</li><li> Some people were a bit confused as to why Gwen and <em>Merlin</em>, on the other hand, seemed to be hitting it off rather... well during the first season. Gwen <em>did</em> have a crush on Merlin, but starting with episode 5 she was getting over it (to a certain degree of success). Too bad the writers rushed so many major developments, such as her and Arthur almost spontaneously developing feelings for each other in Series 2. It's probably for this reason that physical contact between Merlin and Gwen was limited from that point on, to tone down Colin and Angel's chemistry (the characters are meant to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>: The relationship between Adrian Monk and his two attractive female assistants was certainly not an out-of-the-box relationship type. In spite of the obvious opportunities for sexual tension, there is virtually none of it, and the show is all the better for that. Overall, Sharona and Natalie are shown as feeling devotion and even love toward Monk, but in an utterly platonic, somewhat motherly way. Monk, for his part, was always dedicated to the memory of his late wife. However:
<ul><li> In "Mr. Monk Gets Married," when Monk and Sharona have to impersonate a married couple to investigate a man who's married Randy's mother, there is an eyebrow-raising tender moment where Sharona thanks Monk for letting her wear Trudy's ring to carry off the ruse.
</li><li> With Natalie, there were a few isolated incidents where she really seemed to be coming onto him. Such as several scenes in "Mr. Monk Goes to the Bank" where she fawns over how handsome he looks in a security guard uniform, or the downright bizarre stake-out scene in "Mr. Monk and the Genius," where Patrick Kloster spots her and Monk spying on him and Natalie inadvertently blurts, "We should kiss!"
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em>, Libby Kennedy and Stephanie Scully are meant to be 100% heterosexual. Their actors... do not portray them as 100% heterosexual. (The writers added fuel to the fire when, after Libby had left the show, Steph suddenly started dating women.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's probably down to Jennifer Morrison having chemistry with half the male guest stars on the show, but Emma and August certainly seemed as if something was about to go on. Most of August's early scenes consisted of him flirting shamelessly with her and yet nothing came of it. It almost seems as if the writers retconned into a platonic thing, as August was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> in Season 2 and Emma was then given two more canon love interests. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">August's Season 4 return</span> at least acknowledges this somewhat — with Killian getting a little jealous at their conversations.
</li><li> As noted <a class="urllink" href="http://betterwithbob.blogspot.ie/2015/08/bobby-reviews-once-upon-time-season-1_10.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the chemistry between Snow White and Red Riding Hood and the way their scenes are shot look very couple-y. Although Red is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> for Snow and Charming, there's no denying the sheer amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> Snow and Red have.
</li><li> Emma and Regina have been noted to have this, particularly from Season 4. One episode is devoted entirely to Emma attempting to rebuild her friendship with her. And Emma's devotion to Regina is startlingly like that of a lover, <em>especially</em> in the Season 4 finale. Despite both of them having canon love interests, many fans are convinced that Emma and Regina are the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>. It helps a bit that they share a son in different ways — Emma is Henry's biological mother while Regina is Henry's adoptive mother. Both are devoted mothers to Henry so Emma and Regina's relationship to each other and to Henry can play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">Has Two Mommies</a>.
</li><li> Despite Aurora being married to Philip, he's out of sight for most of Season 2 and she shares more screen time with Mulan. Writers seemed to pick up on this one and subvert the trope by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mulan actually is in love with Aurora</span>.
</li><li> Emma and Lily have this in spades. Lily first appears in a flashback as a special friend that Emma once had. Their scenes are shot, lit and scored in a way that made fans wonder if Lily was really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>. If the character had been a boy, it would have immediately been interpreted as a love story. Naturally when Lily was brought back, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> aspect was played up in their scenes even more.
</li><li> Season 3 also sets up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">She Is Not My Girlfriend</a> moment between Hook and Tinkerbell (yes, really). When Emma asks if they were ever involved, Tink denies it while Hook implies it. The matter is never approached again.
</li><li> Despite Ariel's introduction episode being all about her trying to win Eric's heart, she shares only one scene with him. And yet she makes more of an emotional connection with Snow. The friendship between them is given far more development and screen time than Ariel's crush on Eric.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RizzoliAndIsles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RizzoliAndIsles">Rizzoli &amp; Isles</a></em>: Jane and Maura are intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>, but unless one of them is literally in bed with someone else it's very easy to just pretend that they're married. Given the amount of time Jane spends are Maura's house, it wouldn't be difficult for a casual viewer to mistake them as living together. There has been no shortage of subtext, including multiple instances of falling asleep in the same bed, undressing in front of one another, Maura being the only non-family member present at Rizzoli family events (many of which Maura hosts), heart-to-hearts between both Maura and Jane and Maura and <em>Jane's mother</em>, and long, significant glances and meaningful lines, as well as several probably unintentional but still rather poignant parallels. It's firmly established that Jane cares for Maura just as much as her brothers, and Jane is implied to be the first close friend Maura has ever had. The writers have tried to temper this by introducing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOfTheWeek">revolving door</a> of increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">"perfect"</a> love interests for both characters and putting more and more emphasis on their love lives with other people, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">to no avail</a>.

J.D often insists on being touchy-feely with Dr. Cox, even when he gets viciously rebuffed, calls him "Perry" in later seasons and records his voice so he can play it back to him later. Dr. Cox meanwhile calls J.D "newbie" or some variety of girl's names and refers to him as "my intern/attending", plus he drags J.D to a bar with him, in the middle of the night, while J.D is in his pyjamas, because he doesn't want to drink alone. It doesn't help J.D/Elliot was supposed to have been sunk in Season Three by them becoming increasingly dysfunctional and they only got together again very late in the show.

More than one article covering the special "Justice" made the mistaken assumption that Clark's jealous guarding of Chloe from The Flash—er, Impulse was on his own behalf rather than Jimmy Olsen's. Given that this behavior has been happening all the way up to and including Season 8, it's difficult to blame people for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/Smallville">the Chlois theory</a> when they keep doing this.

Particularly the macaroons scene from "Line In The Sand".
</li><li> Earlier, like all the way back in Season 1, there was Samantha and Daniel, who seemed to hit it off and share several very shippy emotional scenes.

However, in what was intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Daniel's swansong</a>, Samantha weeps over his fatally injured body saying she never told him how she felt about him.

They're written like they're the show's blooming romance, and actors Torri Higginson and Joe Flanigan certainly play it like they're a couple. In spite of the relationship's popularity, the writers completely deny any such thing.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> writers famously stopped giving Bashir and Garak so many scenes together when they found out the characters had a huge shipping following. It didn't help that the Bashir and Garak subtext was (according to Andrew Robinson, Ron Moore, and Robert Hewitt Wolfe) <em>put there deliberately</em> with the expectation that nobody would really notice. The same thing happened shortly thereafter with Bashir and O'Brien, but this time the writers realised the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic">slashers</a> were gonna slash anyway, so they continued to emphasize that friendship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>: Kirk and Spock are either in love with each other, or this trope. It's possible they started out as the latter, but the writers were certainly aware of the former interpretation by the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">The Motion Picture</a></em> was filmed—the novelisation reveals that there are rumours about the relationship even in their universe. Instead of attempting to de-slash the relationship, the movies seem to take the subtext and run with it, to the point that the two of them can arguably be read as a married couple.

They also managed enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> to kill a slashficcer on contact, culminating in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a> relationship between Seven and Chakotay, <em>both of whom</em> had had more romantic chemistry with Janeway than they had with each other.

In particular, Tessa has a tendency to refer to George by his first name, instead of calling him "Dad" or "Father". The show even lampshades this when George's friend Noah calls their relationship disgusting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>: Sam and Dean are unusually co-dependent (to the point of it being unhealthy) for just being brothers. They risk their lives for one another countless times, and both of them readily admit they are each others' greatest weakness. In the early seasons especially, the brothers were <em>very</em> touchy-feely with each other, especially Dean towards Sam (though Sam gave as good as he got in Seasons 3 and 4, when he was pretty well permanently terrified that Dean was going to die). Throw in more emotional scenes, brotherly-devotion speeches, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">Died In Your Arms</a> weepery, and they definitely stretched the idea of how "normal" brothers interact. In later seasons this seems to have calmed down, but the brothers have also finally learned how to hug. Eric Kripke, the creator, has admitted that he can see why so many fangirls see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a> between the brothers, lampshading it several times during the series, and one of the Exec Producers herself has been known to refer to the show as <em>The Epic Love Story of Sam and Dean</em>.
</li><li> Allegedly, the writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TinMan">Tin Man</a></em> were going to ship DG and Cain, but Neal McDonough refuses to film love scenes of any kind. As such in the miniseries, fans are split down the middle as to whether there was an attraction — or more of a father/daughter relationship. The fact that Cain believes his wife to be alive for half the story muddies the issue even further.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>: In the first half of season two, the writers put Veronica and Duncan back together as a couple (after quite a while of both the characters and the audience believing they were most likely half-siblings!), and, according to what the writers and show-runner said in interviews, it was a supposed to be a happy, healthy relationship. It did <em>not</em> come off that way at all. Instead, it came across as a miserable relationship where Duncan was having dreams about his ex-girlfriend Meg, generally acting as though he would rather still be Meg, keeping secrets from Veronica. On top of everything, the sex was clearly lousy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em>: Tori Vega and Jade West are supposed to be enemies and competing for the same guy, Beck. However as many fans have pointed out, they seem to have more sexual tension with each other, to the point where it's borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>. Tori often goes to great lengths to help Jade and win her approval. Jade for her part seems to often flirt with Tori, and will often go to Tori when she's upset. The two are also twice made to play a married couple, and even go on a date (albeit by force). Jade also ditches her boyfriend Beck in the final episode and instead spends it with Tori. It got to the point where phrases with their ship name started trending worldwide on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>, and the show and creators started to lampshade it.
</li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> seem to have given Justin and Alex, who are brother and sister, an almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>-like dynamic. It stems, just like the example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>, from the fact that Justin was intended to be a next-door neighbour only for it to be switched late on in pre-production. It doesn't help that one episode featured Alex accidentally wishing that everyone forgot Justin was her brother, causing <em>their own mother</em> to comment that they'd make a cute couple. They try to remedy this by giving them both relationships, and the Justin/Juliet one almost works. Then they got rid of Juliet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell">when they made her an eternal mummy slave</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">and didn't bring her back until near the end of the series</a>. And <em>right after Juliet left</em>, Alex came and comforted Justin, giving him a big, consoling hug.
</li><li> Mulder and Scully of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> are a classic example. The idea that the characters would have an intense platonic relationship but <em>not</em> be sexually or romantically interested in one another was firmly established in the original idea for the series, and the writers repeated it in interviews for years. But by around Season 5 or so the characters seemed to have different ideas, and eventually the writers went with it. It's an interesting case of a Relationship Writing Fumble becoming a canon relationship.

However, between the frequent kisses she gives him, the fact that she doesn't mind undressing in front of him, and the blatant confession that he is important to her implies something else. The epilogue in the 'Fifth Dawn' only made it worse. Considering it was caused by bad writing, the writers were asking for the fumble.

Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">her name was Yoyo</a>, so it was harder to see her as deep.

However, between the context of an American officer having sex with an Indian woman, the fact that other Indians seem to be shooting at Custer as if they're defending her, the fact that the woman doesn't move and is up against a cactus (implying her to be restrained somehow), and the lack of any story to imply seduction, with the back of the box saying "she's not about to take it lying down"... well, suffice to say the accusations that the game depicted a rape were hardly unfounded.

Square and the fans alike have run with this and make frequent jokes about his bisexuality — from his description in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyAllTheBravest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyAllTheBravest">Final Fantasy: All the Bravest</a></em> (which describes his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Typhon</a> as 'questionable'), to the description on his menu item in Square Enix's Eorza Cafe, to his attraction to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> Noel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many gamers when playing <em>VII</em> for the first time thought Barret and Tifa were a couple, or a couple that had recently split up.
</li><li> Marlene is introduced in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> scene implying she's Cloud's daughter with Tifa, and although it's immediately revealed that she's actually Barret's, the perception influenced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</a></em> where Cloud and Tifa act like Marlene's parents, with her dad Barret never interacting with her beside appearing with her in the group photo in the ending.
</li><li> Johnny's relationship to Cloud has confused fans for <em>years</em>. The intention behind Johnny was that he was a friend of Tifa's (possibly ex-boyfriend) who had grown up in Midgar before the start of the game and feels jealous of Tifa's crush, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Cloud</a>. Unfortunately, the crucial early scene establishing Johnny's antagonism towards Cloud (where he yells at him and begs him to '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouEverDoAnythingToHurtHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouEverDoAnythingToHurtHer">treat her like an angel of this slum</a>') was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">cut</a>, so the player's interactions with him in Midgar only show his good side, and we never learn about his affiliation with Tifa. This means the later scene where Cloud encounters Johnny in Costa del Sol and he berates Cloud seems to come out of nowhere, in addition to his lines being mistranslated so that he ends up telling Cloud: "We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were such a playboy. And a @&amp;$%ing murderer!" Since Cloud's backstory is extremely confusing anyway, fans were stuck. Many assumed Johnny was mistaking Cloud for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype">Zack</a> (the person Cloud had taken his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> of being in SOLDIER from); a previous (unrelated) scene had shown Cloud reading a letter Tifa had received from a childhood friend who'd left Nibelheim to live in Midgar, which many other fans assumed was Johnny. In reality, all Johnny had been saying was something like "It can't be! You're that ex-SOLDIER, [Tifa's] childhood friend, and sexy playboy! A, and... a murderer!" It's at least finally cleared up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> where Johnny just has a crush on Tifa while he's trying to get to Cloud's good side by calling him "bro" with little success.
</li><li> The original draft for Lucrecia's story would have had her as the one woman on Hojo's staff, being drugged and raped to serve as mother of the genetically modified baby that would become Sephiroth. This was cut and replaced with Lucrecia being a willing participant in the experiment, which has the effect of turning her originally intended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostLenore">Lost Lenore</a> role into a weird, abusive relationship where Vincent is still obsessively in love with a woman who did crimes against humanity. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus">Dirge of Cerberus</a></em> ramps this up to the point where she is <em>responsible for the death of Vincent's father</em>, and yet he doesn't love her any less.
</li><li> Part of the reason the <em>Complete</em> cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</a></em> came out was because, in the original movie, Cloud had far more to do with the unrelated Vincent than he ever spent willingly talking to his own family members. The extended version gives him an actual relationship with his adopted ward Marlene, when in the original he only had a couple of scenes where he was even <em>in the same room with her</em>.
</li><li> Vincent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus">Dirge of Cerberus</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> with Shalua, a certain flirty tinge to his relationship with Yuffie, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a> plotline with a character that biologically appears as a ten-year-old. His official love interest is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">Lucrecia</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em>, Tifa and Aerith are both Cloud's love interests, who get parallel scenes where each one shows him around the area of Midgar they live in, each asks him about their outfit, each do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PietaPlagiarism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PietaPlagiarism">Pietà Plagiarism</a> pose with him, and so on... until they meet each other, get on better with each other than they do Cloud, agree to go on "a date" with each other, and start to exclude Cloud from their plans and dungeon puzzle activities, which makes him visibly annoyed. Since Cloud is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Celibate Hero</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> who is always defensive around the girls, showing profound discomfort and clumsiness even with hugging or touching them, his romantic chemistry with them is limited compared to how much they are both able to react with open affection for each other. Even in The Drum, when the party is divided, Cloud is partnered up with Barret to develop <em>their</em> bromance while the girls continue to cheer each other on, joke and, apparently, flirt.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> After Tidus has met Yuna, he has a dream about the two of them preparing to run away to Zanarkand—only for Rikku to show up, angrily saying he said he would take her. The dream looks as if it's setting up a love triangle between the three. But by the time Rikku joins the party, Tidus and Yuna are already established as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> and later all Rikku's scenes with Tidus make it clear they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> has no official romance, but a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>. Vaan and Penelo look as if they're set up to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>, and Penelo seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest">The Not-Love Interest</a> to him. But then the game ends with an implication that there is a romance involved ("every sky pirate needs a partner"). Balthier is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> but he has special affection towards Fran, and there is a line from her in the sequel that says he tried to woo her. There's also a line in the ending about how Ashe misses Basch; the way it's delivered suggests it's in a romantic way rather than platonic. There are also one or two scenes that hint at a Vaan and Ashe pairing—as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Defrosting Ice Queen</a> moments are usually with him. But again nothing is confirmed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fang and Vanille. Nothing is exactly stated, but Fang's heavy concern for Vanille and her readiness to take on the world if it meant to protect Vanille, just made their interactions a little subtext-heavy. Same with Vanille, who went out to find Fang, after being separated from her earlier on. Whether it's intended as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a> or simply a carry-over from the original concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">Fang being a man</a> and their interactions not changed is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Hope and Lightning. They spend a good amount of time alone together when the party splits up and Lightning does take Hope under her wing, to toughen him up. Their interactions can easily swing between motherly/mentor feelings on Lightning's side, but can just as easily be seen as romantic. <em>Then</em> came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns</a></em> and put a heavy subtext into the relationship of Lightning and Hope <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64w4z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note64w4z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64w4z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the Japanese version</span>, to the point that it almost feels like they <em>are</em> being set up as a romantic couple, which caused the English localization to lessen this emphasis and throw in a nod towards a potential crush from Hope towards Vanille, only to be immediately denied and never brought up again as the game keeps marching into Lightning and Hope's territory. Then the post-game novel was released, and any kind of subtlety is thrown off the window, starting with Hope (now reborn as a young man) denying having ever seen Lightning as a mother figure and revealing he went insane over illusions of Lightning prior to his abduction and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">author (who is also the scenario writer for the trilogy)</a> dropping major hints towards Lightning going to meet Hope in the in-game epilogue.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>: Due to the relaunch of the game, much of the Scions characters and relationships were a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> for players who didn't play 1.0. 2.0 didn't spend much time re-establishing them. For the most part this wasn't a huge deal, but it did lead multiple players to misunderstand the relationship between Thancred and Minfillia. Since the former is a pretty big playboy and also cares very deeply for the latter, many players misconstrued this as romantic love, when in actuality it was closer to parental. See, in 1.0, Minfillia's father died in an accident, and Thancred felt guilty for being unable to save him, leaving her an orphan, so he (along with F'lhamnin, the woman responsible for said accident) essentially became her foster parents. He even at one point in Heavensward has to clarify to Krile that his interest in Minfillia is strictly non-romantic. So when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a> during Shadowbringers, it wasn't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to potentially losing his love for a child, it was because his daughter was planning to sacrifice herself for a young girl that looks just like her.</span> If there is anyone that Thancred is really interested in beyond his playboy ways, it's F'lhamnin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entire game, practically. The story's constant focus on the relationship between Noctis and his three male friends, combined with his obvious reluctance to get married, can come across as him being a closeted gay man and marrying purely for politics. It doesn't help that he only interacts with his canon love interest in two or three scenes on-screen, while there are entire quests called "Tours" dedicated to Noctis just hanging out and bonding with any three of his friends one-on-one.
</li><li> Ignis, towards Noctis. Brotherhood is a major theme of the game, and the four main characters are described at various points as having a brotherly bond of friendship. At one point Regis explicitly tells a young Ignis to serve as a brother to Noctis. But Ignis's extreme level of dedication to Noctis, including his willingness to throw away the entire world's future in exchange for his friend's safety among other things, and the fact that his relationship with Noctis employs numerous of what are typically thought of as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes">Love Tropes</a>, to the same or even greater degree than what Noctis's actual love interest gets, caused quite a lot of players to come away believing his attachment to Noctis is rooted in feelings of a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">romantic</a> than brotherly nature instead, and not always because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles">Shipping Goggles</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of Lunafreya, although she and Noctis are supposed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, and is said to have been in love with him since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">childhood</a>, most fans who saw <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingsglaiveFinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingsglaiveFinalFantasyXV">Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</a></em> believe she had more romantic chemistry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Nyx Ulric</a>. This is likely the result of <em>Kingsglaive</em> being based on the early portion of the game from when it was still <em>Versus XIII</em>, and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">taking over Noctis's original role</a>, whatever romantic development Noctis was supposed to have with Stella was inadvertently carried over to Nyx's interactions with Lunafreya. It also doesn't help that Lunafreya is a notorious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter">They Wasted a Perfectly Good Character</a> in the main game and that even fans of her and Noctis's romance have heavily criticized it for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a>, leaving her relationship with Nyx to be the better developed of the two.

The princess gets captured, so Ramza offers to go along to help, despite his superior's objections. When his superior turns on Agrias in an attempt to kill said princess, Ramza fights him off. Later, the princess is captured once again and Agrias is forced to flee, getting saved by... you guessed it, Ramza. At this point in the game, however, she joins the rest of the generic player characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">and can die permanently</a>... Whereupon she gets a few lines of dialogue in the next fight, and then nothing whatsoever. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">War of the Lions</a></em> rerelease then went and added an optional mini-event where Mustadio reveals his previously-unmentioned crush on Agrias, with the possibility that she might reciprocate. So, which character is supposed to be her romantic interest, again?
</li><li> The two main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChroniclesRingOfFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChroniclesRingOfFates">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</a></em> are the (twin) brother and sister pair Yuri and Chelinka. Presumably their interaction was intended to be platonic, but when Yuri is swearing to always protect Chelinka and never to leave her side, this gets a lot harder for the players to believe...

In the first game, it looked like he was bisexual on account of having massive amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Princess Elincia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Soren</a> (though Elincia's share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubText">seems to have been added only the English script</a>). In the second game, Ike's romantic subtext with Elincia was written out entirely, to both give way to Elincia being more receptive to Geoffrey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Bodyguard Crush</a> on her (which can end up in marriage if the player so desires) and ramp up the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> between Ike and Soren, painting the second more as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">Straight Gay</a>. Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> revealed a character named Priam, who wields Ike's sword and claims to be his descendant. While some fans have simply settled on believing Priam to simply be a descendant of Ike's sister Mist, which is a rather plausible idea due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia">Marth being a descendant of Anri the Hero through Anri's brother Marcellus</a>, it's not necessarily a perfect theory, so any attempt to "prove" Ike's sexuality one way or another through the way inheritance now works have fallen through. As such, if Priam <em>is</em> Ike's direct descendant and Ike was intended to be either straight or straight-leaning bisexual all along, the writers on both sides of the ocean did a pretty terrible job of getting that across. However, due to Ike's lack of what could be perceived as romantic attraction to either of them from his side of things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">it is possible</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality">none of the above to be true at all</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> can be seen as doing this with Chrom and the Avatar. While it makes sense for them to be close, due to them being the main characters and best friends, Chrom has four (five if you count the Village Maiden) other possible brides and the Avatar of either gender can marry anyone of the opposite gender. But the writing in the final arc puts so much emphasis on the relationship that it's like they're married no matter who you chose for their spouses; with the possible exception of Lissa, Frederick, Lucina and <em>maybe</em> Basilio and Flavia, any other spouse of the Avatar gets pushed into the background, and Chrom's wife stops being relevant after chapter 13. Even the Future Past DLC makes a big deal of how much the Avatar loved Chrom and features them watching over Lucina together at the end. If you ship either character with anyone else, it can be really jarring.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> The writers have a strong tendency to overdo the scenes with Sora and Riku. Most people seem to agree that the actual <em>fumble</em> comes when they reunite in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, in which Kairi and Sora simply have a hug (which, at first, he makes somewhat awkward-looking by not hugging back for a few seconds out of surprise), while in the reunion with Riku, he gets on his knees and cries his eyes out going "I looked for you!". At the same time, though, the series makes it very clear that Sora cares deeply Kairi, and he <em>did</em> get on his knees for her too earlier, albeit not in front of her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg">in a sadder context</a> (and the HD remaster made it more apparent that he actually cried over her too in the Gummi Ship after learning she had been kidnapped by Axel.)
</li><li> Many of Sora and Riku's interactions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em> are <em>especially</em> heavy on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>. This probably stands out most near the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while Sora is comatose</span>. One could argue that it's not even a fumble at this point, and the writers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">well aware of what they're doing.</a>
</li><li> The first two games also created a bit of subtext between Sora and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">Ariel</a>, not helped by the fact that her canon partner wasn't in the first game. The first scene between Sora and Ariel does have something that looks like flirting going on. Ariel's desire to see other worlds is paralleled to Sora's ambitions at the start of the game. Plus they share a couple of intimate scenes and Ariel is the only one of the Disney characters to worry about never seeing Sora again. But Sora is clearly attracted to Kairi and Ariel gets paired up with Eric in the second game (something that Sora actually helps with).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> shows that they didn't learn from the Sora/Ariel thing, as it recreates almost exactly the same scenario with Sora/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Rapunzel</a>. Much of the gameplay in Corona boils down to "Rapunzel sees a new outside-world thing and Sora shows her how awesome it is". In <em>KHIII</em>, this is a vehicle for fun minigames, where in <em>Tangled</em>, it was a vehicle for romantic development. Making this either better or worse is that, unlike in <em>KHI</em> Atlantica, Rapunzel's canon romantic partner <em>isn't</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> — Flynn is right there in your party as well, watching as this all happens, and you half expect it to turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>.

It appears the reason for this is that Obsidian's Chris Avellone is quite anti-romance, and even goes on record that he doesn't want one in his games unless it ends badly.

<ul><li> The relationship between the main character and his younger sister — who is the crown princess and heir apparent of the queendom — is, perhaps, depicted as being a little <em>too</em> close.

In-game, their interactions and trust in each other can be read in various ways, with Bill mentioning 'trouble in paradise' at one point, but nothing ever being a name for the exact nature of their relationship. Tess does say at one point that 'there must be enough here', being the closest to indicating that there might be romance between them, but whether it goes into the physically intimate or merely a deep bond of trust realm is up for interpretation.

The game is supposed to treat the two of them as rivals who have differing opinions of the war and why Crow shot the chancellor, while Rean is a bonafide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Chick Magnet</a> and does have a few women attracted to him. Unfortunately, the game presents them being a couple who underwent a bad break-up and are trying to mend their relationship. The game does have some elements of dating sim for Rean to pair up with any girl but unfortunately, all those events end up being optional and can be skipped by players if so desired. Crow's events, however, are mandatory to the plot (he's technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>) and Rean always thinks about Crow even if he's not there.

After Rean kills The Nameless One in rage for killing one of his friends, Crow immediately stops fighting Alisa's team with his mask dropping and immediately <em>jumps down thousands of miles to the bottom of the Gral of Erebos</em> (summoning his mech) and immediately restrains Rean to get a hold of himself.</span> Meanwhile in <em>Cold Steel IV</em>, an in-game month passing by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Rean breaks out of his confinement, Crow (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Duvalie</a>) team up with him but before the fight starts, Crow tosses Rean, who is still in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>, a 50 mira coin and Rean has a mild response to it. And then there's the First Rivalry of the game (where all the Divine Knights have to fight in specific areas and whoever loses gets absorbed by the winner) where Crow nearly disappears but Rean won't let him <em>by hugging</em> Crow so tightly while Valimar reverses the absorption and gives the power back to Ordine to sustain Crow's life.</span> All these happen <em>before</em> Rean even starts doing any bonding events.

While the writing itself makes it clear they're simply friends, changes independently made by the animators that were not asked for by the writers (most noticeably, a recurring tendency of Clover to almost flirtatiously wink at Qrow), and the decisions of the official twitter account and voice actors to play up their relationship into almost romantic territory to promote the Volume (especially with posts likening them to more canonical couples like Ren/Nora and Yang/Blake) made fans assume the two were meant to be seen as a couple in the making, especially considering the fandom was, at the time, hungering for some male LGBT+ representation. This backfired immensely when the Rooster Teeth crew was accused of queerbaiting by the end of the Volume due to what happened in the last two episodes, and they admitted that these changes were not a good idea when they never intended to make them a couple.

And then in <em>Omniverse</em>, Kevin goes evil <em>again</em> but Ben saves him this time.
</li><li> Really, the Relationship Writing Fumble is just a regular part of the series at this point. Gwen starts dating Kevin? They have more subtext with Ben and Charmcaster, respectively, than they do with each other. Ben's final love interest as revealed in <em>Omniverse</em>? Little-to-no chemistry between them due the character (the aforementioned girl who wanted his werewolf form as a pet) not appearing in the franchise for over 200 episodes, especially compared to the interactions between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ben and Rook.</a>

She also has a heart to heart and long, laughter-filled date with Gene in one episode, after which she becomes his devoted Gene-can-do-no-wrong fangirl and texts/calls him constantly. Tony also comes across as flirting with Rhodey a lot of the time, made even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> intensive whenever Rhodey yells at him to open up and stop blocking people out. They have so many heart to heart conversations and Tony apologizes to him so often it's more reminiscent of a squabbling couple than best friends. Then there's the way Whitney follows Tony around even when he's being an asshole to her (although given her abusive father, she might just be okay with it) and how far she'll go to save his life... And we're not even going to get into Tony's fanboying of Gene Khan. Oh, and in the last few episodes, Rhodey seems to care a bit more about Whitney than he lets on.

</li><li> What, exactly, is the relationship between Twilight Sparkle and Spike? They're definitely close enough to consider each other family, but the nature of their bond is never specified. They've shown signs of being friends, siblings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">mother and son</a> (Twilight <em>did</em> hatch him, after all), and it can be argued that Spike shows evidence of having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> on her at times.

It isn't until season nine's "Twilight's Seven" that we finally we learn that they view each other as siblings, with that reveal being the result of <em>Spike's own voice actress</em> asking for this issue to be cleared up. Whether Twilight's parents raised him or such duties were split between them and Celestia is still up in the air, though.
</li><li> Cheese Sandwich's idolisation of Pinkie Pie appears to be simple respect for her talents.

<ul><li> To an extent this applies to Adora and Catra as well.

They understand each other so well and have such a good friendship in later episodes that many thought Raven liked Robin and she's the only person capable of calming his mind in "Haunted", something even Starfire wasn't able to accomplish.

At one point Krolia mentions Shiro having helped raise Keith, and he does have some (admitted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to be unintentional) resemblance to Keith's father, suggesting a <em>fatherly</em> role<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nkym');"><sup>Although... </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0nkym" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nkym');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Given Keith's own extreme resemblance to his mother and certain other similarities with how his parents met, others interpret the resemblance as yet more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a>-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse">Like Parent, Like Spouse</a> kind</span>. However, this is contradicted by flashbacks which show Shiro as closer to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a> instead, and Keith himself also describes Shiro on two separate occasions as <em>brotherly</em> (although that interpretation also receives some pushback from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>). Meanwhile, because up to that point the two share quite a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>, because Shiro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest">fulfills quite a few of the roles a love interest normally would</a> towards Keith<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1j736');"><sup>Explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1j736" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1j736');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Shiro</a> is the most important person to Keith, to the point that Keith becomes unhinged when he thinks Shiro might be dead. A lot of Keith's motivation throughout the series is protecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInDistress">Shiro</a> and keeping him safe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">to the point of jeopardizing crucial missions against galactic threats on the off chance that Shiro could be harmed or leave him</a>. At one point Keith makes an explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection">Declaration of Protection</a> towards Shiro under intimate circumstances, which Shiro acknowledges and accepts. Keith even prefers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">dying along with Shiro</a> to the prospect of living on without him, and gives him a (admittedly platonic) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>. The show also compares and contrasts Shiro's relationship with Keith to his former lover</span>, and because neither have any other viable love interests to speak of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aside from Shiro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup">Last Minute Hookup</a> brought about by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a></span>, bolstered by Shiro being gay and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Incompatible Orientation</a> not being an obstacle, others interpret them not as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest">The Not-Love Interest</a> but as each other's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a></em> instead, despite the show's indications otherwise.
</li><li> After previous seasons established that Acxa and Keith shared some sort of unspoken bond, Season 7 has a few moments of heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> that appeared to suggest Acxa had romantic feelings for Keith. However nothing ever comes of it, and in fact the following season focuses much more heavily on her budding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">friendship</a> with Veronica.
