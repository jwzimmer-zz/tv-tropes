<ul><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin">Witch Hunter Robin</a></em>, when Robin and Amon go to ground, the witch hunter organization is barely able to function. Robin, a powerful pyrokinetic, and Amon, the resident gun-toting badass, make most of the captures. The remaining members are focused mostly on intelligence and support, with little combat ability.
</li><li> Iceburg of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> fits, in that according to Spandam, because Iceburg had not only transformed Water 7 back into a shipbuilding corporation with the Galley-La Company, but by supplying the World Government with ships, he became too important and well-connected to simply get rid of.
<ul><li> Garp is opposed morally to almost all his superiors, and openly undercuts them and causes havoc without even a pretense of restraint. Firing him was never an option though, as he's one of the strongest fighters in the Marines and an inspiring hero to the entire rank and file.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Zero</a> invokes a more situational version of this right before they enter the Battle of Narita. He puts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Black Knights</a> in an extremely untenable situation (surrounded by enemies with seemingly no means of escape), then tells them that their only options are to give him complete trust and command, or shoot him dead and try to escape on their own.
<ul><li> Lelouch/Zero generally is an excellent example of this trope. When he's around, the Black Knights are a force to be reckoned with; when he's not, however, such as when he's lured away during crucial battle in the finale of the first season... yeah, things don't tend to go so well.
</li><li> This continues to the second season, despite Lelouch actually pushing things to a more stable and complex command structure for the Black Knights. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> While he's off having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> over the apparent death of his sister, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Schneizel</a> steps in and basically completely tears apart the Black Knights by making them turn on Lelouch.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This was used as the argument behind not taking down Goldie Muso in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em> series, even though there was no real evidence that the mob had gotten out of control while she had amnesia, and that the person this was presented to had considerable first-person evidence to Goldie's status as a monster.
</li><li> In a filler episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em>, Gunther decides to go off on his own and see the state of the Great Demon Kingdom for himself. As he actually takes care of most of the Demon King's duties as well as his own work, it falls to Yuuri to handle everything until he comes back. Yuuri is quickly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work Gunther does.
</li><li> A Johto episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> had Brock getting sick, leaving Ash and Misty to do his chores. This turns out to be quite a bit, including the cooking, which Misty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">fails to replicate</a>.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em> has Ryu the Owl quitting the team in shame after his mistake puts them all in jeopardy. Problem is, he was the only one who could flawlessly pilot the God Phoenix, and when Joe takes over for him he proves to be epically bad at it. Thankfully, Ryu overcomes his shame and rejoins the team at the end of the episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessKnight">Princess Knight</a></em>, this trope is how the women of Silverland kick off their revolution. When the soldiers threaten to arrest them all, they point out that throwing them all in jail means that the men get to raise the children and cook and clean and do the laundry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranxx">DARLING in the FRANXX</a></em>: 002 and the high-performance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Franxx</a> she pilots are so vital to the defense of the plantations that APE has no choice but to deploy her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">when things get desperate</a>, never mind that she keeps maiming her co-pilots. And she's completely aware of this, doing whatever she likes solely because she can and she knows how much they need her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Nana</a> resorts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">repeatedly throwing the book at her</a> in an attempt to stop her running roughshod over the entire chain of command, and she undermines even that at the first opportunity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a>,</em> the Chimera Ants take over the Palace of East Gorteau. They kill the country's dictator shortly after arriving, with Pitou <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyPuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyPuppet">keeping his corpse animated and fresh</a> with her Nen to appear on television and make announcements; however, his Secretary of State, Bizeff, was the one <em>actually</em> running the country and is basically allowed to keep doing so while the Ants prepare to eat everybody.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em>:
<ul><li> A variation with Flycatcher: he thinks his continual community service sentences for minor violations are cruel and unusual, but he's the only one who can keep The Woodlands floors clean, and it keeps him from going back to the Homelands to try and save his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dead</span> family. In the long run (<em>very</em> long), this works out; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flycatcher takes back his rightful place as king of a new Homeland, and actually wages a successful campaign against the Adversary that leads to the Fables having a nice foothold in the Homelands for the first time since the war began</span>. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Ambrose</span> still visits Fabletown occasionally <em>just to sweep the floors.</em> There's <em>still</em> no-one else who can do his job.
</li><li> Wholesale averted in the same story, when the original Fabletown leadership of Mayor Old King Cole, Deputy Mayor Snow White, and Sheriff Bigby Wolf are all replaced when Cole loses an election. Their jobs are taken over by, respectively, Prince Charming, Beauty, and the Beast. You would expect that they would fail horribly at replacing our beloved main characters, but instead they all performed quite well in their positions (especially Charming). Notable, however, is the fact that all three had a hard time of things at first, all three complained at times, and Prince Charming never stopped complaining about the responsibility right until the end. On multiple occasions, he mentions that Cole made the job look MUCH easier than it really was, and Beauty once asked how Snow got so damned good at her job. Beast seems to adapt the quickest and most effectively, but the good advice he got from Bigby early on helped smooth his path to growth. Also, the old office holders were unwilling to take their old jobs back.
</li></ul></li><li> Both played straight and averted in several European (mostly Italian) stories involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Scrooge McDuck</a>. With his tendency to travel around the world seeking treasure, several stories have him mysteriously missing, declared deceased, etc. Either his heirs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Gladstone) or his office staff try to keep his financial empire running. In stories playing it straight, they really mess things up and manage to damage said empire. When Scrooge inevitably resurfaces, he has his hands full with a rebuilding process. In stories averting the trope, the replacements initially have problems but eventually wise up to proper ways of running things.

Oddly, this is a case the heroes slightly encourage. If the lieutenants are fighting each other, they tend to be too busy to invade Earth. And the citizens of Apokolips are, arguably, better off with several would-be overlords than with Darkseid in charge. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, when Orion disposes of Darkseid for good and seizes the planet, he soon finds that countless generations of tyranny have made the population brainless and morally-bankrupt, so freeing them just gave them what they needed to slaughter each other mindlessly.

<ul><li> There's an interesting version where the King spends all day hunting dragons and the Queen spends all day sewing, and they decide to switch not so much out of "your job must be easy" but out of sheer boredom. The Queen finds that dragons are actually nice and also almost extinct thanks to all the hunting, and the King finds that he doesn't really like sewing. At the end of the day, they've decided that the way it's always been done is stupid, so the Queen finds better things to do than sewing and the two of them invite the dragons to come over weekly for tea.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is Ankh-Morpork's current Patrician Lord Vetinari, a benevolent tyrant who stays in power not because anyone actually likes him, but because they dislike him less than any of the other options (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">including each other</a>). Several times he has been forced out of power (or quietly stepped aside when asked), then immediately resumed his usual role when the new regime collapses from its own inability to deal with the crisis that was their excuse to seize power in the first place. Many books set in Ankh-Morpork involve plots to overthrow him or remove him as a happy side effect of another goal (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>). This is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">just as planned</a> — while Machiavelli may say it is better to be feared than loved, Vetinari holds that being permanent is best of all, and has remade the political system around him to work best when he's leading it. The trope comes into effect when people like Sam Vimes, William de Worde, and Moist von Lipwig, who don't like Vetinari at all, still find themselves forced to help stop those plots because the alternative is worse (the time-travel novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> explains quite graphically just <em>how</em> bad things were before Vetinari came to power). The conspiracy in <em>The Truth</em> comes closest to succeeding, but is foiled by Vetinari's symbiotic relationship with the Watch and the nascent Morporkian free press. Reading through the books in order, it becomes clear that over time fewer and fewer people are actually willing to attempt removing Vetinari and those few are getting more and more unhinged. By the time of <em>Feet of Clay</em>, Vimes muses that at this point, the only people who would kill Vetinari are either those who don't care if the city collapses or someone who would be on top of the pile in the event of such a collapse; the only two people in that second category are Vimes himself and Carrot, neither of whom would actually do that. It is explicitly stated that although Vetinari's power is resented by citizens both low and high, they do rather like that he's turned the city into the economic and cultural hub of the entire Disc and aren't inclined to go through all the fuss and muss of changing Patricians. He has tamed the city like a dog... and most dogs do not like it when the master is no longer around.
</li><li> Vetinari's also an extremely good judge of character and part of his success has been in ensuring that other major city institutions are run by the most competent and reasonable candidates. Examples: giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">Sam Vimes</a>' Watch real power and funding after he cleaned up his drinking problem, letting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">William de Worde</a> become the de facto leader of the Fourth Estate, and quietly supporting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Ponder Stibbons</a>' rise at Unseen University. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman">Moist von Lipwig</a> is another protégé of Vetinari. As a master con man, Moist is capable of changing bureaucratic institutions like the postal and banking systems that otherwise would never have a prayer of reasonable reform, and changing them in ways that eventually become self-sustaining and <em>don't</em> require his continual involvement. This suggests that Vetinari is slowly working towards an Ankh-Morpork that needs a <em>capable</em> leader who can continue his balancing act, but also an Ankh-Morpork that will not immediately fall off a cliff after he eventually dies... deconstructing his own job security.
</li><li> Samuel Vimes also qualifies. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, the Assassins Guild has taken him off the register, meaning they won't accept any contracts to kill him (the only other person to share this distinction being Vetinari), a sure sign that the city would be much worse off without him around. Also, they consider him not to be a good sportsman in regards to assassination attempts on himself, as Vimes is far more concerned with staying alive than with the Guild's reputation as "being cool", and so enjoys dishing out humiliating punishments to would-be assassins with the air of a common street tough finally getting one over on a snooty aristocrat.
<div class="indent"><em>The Assassins Guild understood the political game in the city better than anyone, and if they took you off the register it was because they felt your departure would not only spoil the game but also smash the board.</em>
</div></li><li> This is illustrated nicely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></em> when Vimes and every other senior Watch officer leave town temporarily for various reasons and Colon is left the most senior officer. He quickly devolves into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">The Neidermeyer</a> from the increased stress and responsibility and runs the Watch into the ground. That said, the crime rate still goes <em>down</em>, because while the criminals in the city know Vimes isn't around, they know he <em>will</em> be back, and he <em>will not</em> be happy if things go badly while he's away.
</li><li> Another <em>Discworld</em> example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Archchancellor Ridcully</a>. He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a> (though as time goes on, he's revealed to actually be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a> and to employ a great deal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> — he <em>is</em> listening, he just generally pretends he isn't) and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>, much to the annoyance of the other wizards. But they remember that before him, the Unseen University was rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> — to which Ridcully is immune by simply being way too robust and powerful for most couch potato wizards to kill (one attempted assassin went deaf for two weeks because Ridcully ambushed <em>him</em> instead, bashed his head against the door, and gave him one mother of a loud scolding) — and not just for the position of Archchancellor, leading to this exchange in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><em>"You know, we used to kill wizards like him." <br/>"Yes, but we used to kill wizards like us too."</em>
</div></li><li> Ponder Stibbons has moved into this as, essentially, chief administrator of Unseen University by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em>. Ridcully's method of dealing with paperwork is to put it all in a pile and ignore it, as well as anyone trying to talk to him about its contents. Ponder has progressively picked up the slack on all of this, is the only one who understands all of the University's customs, rules, and finances, and by now holds majority vote in staff meetings though few of the other wizards have taken any notice.
</li><li> The Librarian is another example of this trope within UU. While Ridcully was initially taken aback at the notion of having an ape on the faculty, the fact that nobody else at UU has the nerve or know-how to manage the Library's dangerous books is sure to keep him in bananas in perpetuity. During the Librarian's illness in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em>, the unmanaged books started attacking people, and the section of Critical Essays went critical. Not to mention the fact that "If you mentioned to the wizards that there was an orangutan in the library, they would be more likely to ask the Librarian if he'd seen it", and that he's been an orangutan for so long that nobody can remember his real name, with the possible exception of Rincewind. It's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Horace Worblehat</span>, if you're curious. Not only that, but the library also contains books that would drive a man mad by glancing at them. Since the Librarian isn't <em>technically</em> a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">man</a></em>, he is the only one who can possibly handle them.

Join a church. It can be any church for any god of any description. 2.

Continue step 2 until she is considered indispensable to the running of several major functions of the church. 4. Get into a disagreement with someone in charge of the church, and promptly leave, cutting all ties, thus throwing the entire structure into confusion.
</li><li> Lu-Tze is also an example. He's a Sweeper at the History Monks head-quarters, and that's a loathed job by itself, but one that absolutely needs to be done. Lu-Tze is also one of the most adept History Monks alive and a legend in his own lifetime. Most of the monks can't stand him and try their best to exclude him or work their way around him wherever possible. Unfortunately for them, he's indispensable: not only in terms of ability and experience but in sheer common sense... which is often his greatest weapon in a world that often observes common sense isn't that common. Still... most of them have at least learned to value Rule One by now.
</li><li> The Bursar at Unseen University might be one. Rather than achieving and holding his position the traditional way via magical assassination, he got it by doing the necessary work that nobody else wants to do, and keeps it for the same reason. He was eventually relieved of his duties when his madness progressed to the point that he couldn't do accounting anymore, but by that point he was so ingrained in the position that they let him keep it officially while Ponder does the actual work.

It also leaves witches without the leader none of them would ever admit to having.

Their view is that people get pissed for a reason, and the leader of the current rebellion probably knows what the problems are. So they ask him if he could do a better job of running his region; upon the inevitable 'yes', they put him in charge as governor and let him handle the headaches. He either A) fails and is miserable in a hard job with the populace hating him, or B) does a good job and straightens things out. The Tamuli Empire sees it as a win/win situation for them.

He's a crime lord, but under his rule, gang violence in Chicago quieted and he's made sure as few civilians were hurt by the criminal underworld as possible. He even personally executes anyone who hurts children in Chicago. It's stated in universe that while no-one is happy that Marcone is so powerful, he's infinitely better than any alternative, so he's mostly left alone by the authorities. In the short story "Aftermath", which takes place shortly after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry is shot dead at the end of <em>Changes</em></span>, Murphy unhappily concedes that Marcone is in an even stronger position because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a signatory of the Unseelie Accords and thus a minor power in the Chicago magical community, Marcone has basically become the city's first line of defence against supernatural threats</span>.

In the prelude to the series beginning, he has gathered an enormous amount of power by controlling virtually the entire economy of the Seven Kingdoms — including handling a unknowing amount of quiet debt relief on the side, both on and off the books. Most treasurers would simply collect the taxes, suggest budgets and call it all good when they get into the black, but Littlefinger took those taxes and heavily invested, speculated and otherwise multiplied (or, you know, bubbled) them, doubling and redoubling the incomes until the royal treasury collects nearly ten times the annual revenue of just over a decade before. Yet, somehow, it's still not <em>quite</em> in the black for all this economic activity. All this while, he's appointed his own people into various subordinate positions and offices, nearly all of them overlooked non-nobles, fellow petty nobles or outright foreigners with great potential merit who, henceforth, just so happen to owe their livelihoods to him, even though it's usually the Crown officially hiring them. His job is safe on two counts: 1) he's so damned good at it that removing him would be almost unthinkable and 2) he himself is a noble of almost no renown — replacing him would inevitably mean having to hire a more active, traditional threat. Littlefinger's no knight himself and he has virtually no sworn swords to speak of (certainly not a full battalion of them; a handful of hedge knights and the odd mercenary aren't, on paper, numbers to fear), his lands are tiny, out-of-the-way and infamously poor (fishing, goats and sheep), and his house has almost no ties with or influence on the bulk of the nobility even inside his native region of the Vale, because it's such a young house. If such a successful Master of Coin also commanded great, well-equipped armies with longstanding blood and marriage ties to other important families capable of raising their own armies in turn, they would be an enormously obvious threat to everybody, but Littlefinger has no such armies or ties and is willing to work with just about anybody to get whatever he wants, happily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">exposing their backs for the inevitable</a>.
<ul><li> In the later half of the series, he's appointed Lord of Harrenhal and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands and leaves King's Landing. His immediate successors range from middling to downright incompetent, leading Hands and regents alike to think, "Gods, I wish Baelish were back here; he would know what to do." Little do they know that Littlefinger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">has bigger fish to fry</a>. It's implied that Littlefinger has done this on purpose while concealing just how much he's needed, turning the finances of Westeros into a time bomb that starts ticking the moment he leaves the city. Tyrion figures out this whole system when he briefly holds the office (it's why <em>we</em> know it, in fact); but Littlefinger has him removed from office in spectacular fashion before he could do anything about it. Tyrion also notes that the numbers don't quite add up, and the crown has way more debt than it should given all this new income; he suspects that Littlefinger was robbing the Crown blind, but there are several clues that the whole thing is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi">Ponzi</a> scheme on a continental scale.

Leaving his office for just a few minutes to ask Sherlock's help leaves him worried that the bureaucrats will make a hash of things in his absence. The only reason this was allowed to happen is that he has no ambition of any kind; they pay him enough to maintain his house and membership in the club where he spends most of his time, and that's all he wants.

Warrick immediately has to cope with various crises, including fellow CSIs who are miffed that they got passed over for the job. Despite having the job dropped in his lap, Warrick handles everything well. When Grissom comes back in the final sequence, he implies that he's trying to <em>avoid</em> this trope by determining which of the CSIs would be best-suited to replace him. The episode ends with Warrick sitting down with Grisson to recount everything that happened on the shift. And when Grissom <em>leaves</em>, things do take a turn for the worse for a while, because Catherine tries to both do Grissom's job and continue handling all the paperwork and day-to-day minutiae that she always did because Grissom wasn't interested or didn't like it. It causes at least one CSI to leave and blame Catherine for "ineffective leadership," at which point Nick tells her that's why she needs a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne">number two</a>" as much as Grissom did.

It involved Hotch's superior, Erin Strauss, using Prentiss as a "mole" in Season Two to see if Hotch really was doing a good job in charge of the BAU (as that season saw issues arise with three profilers). After poor tactical choices left two people dead under Hotch's watch in "Doubt", Strauss suspended Hotch for two weeks, and took over as Unit Chief for "In Name And Blood". The abbreviated team-minus the departed Gideon and Prentiss, who resigned rather than play the mole-had incredible difficulty without Hotch, and Strauss' poor handling of the case caused even more trouble. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As Garcia blocked the records of Hotch's and Prentiss' reassignments from going through the system</span>, Hotch and Prentiss came back to the case, which ended with Hotch making a brilliant tactical decision to apprehend the Unsub. Strauss then realized that, despite her dislike of Hotch, she does need him.
<ul><li> Strauss eventually becomes friendlier with Hotch when she realizes the job security goes two ways: she finally accepts he really <em>isn't</em> out to get promoted and replace her and is happy with his job, which was one of the reasons she was initially hostile toward him. This is finally solidified when he helps her get treatment for her alcoholism rather than using it to get rid of her.

However, the job is harder than Dick expected (especially with that crew), making him want Michael back as the producer, to the point where Dick's willing to take a pay cut so the station can meet Michael's demands.
</li><li> The opposite occurs in another episode where Michael goes out of town for awhile and puts the secretary in charge of producing, expecting her to do badly. But she ends up being better at the job, and picking guests that Dick wants on the show. The station considers replacing Michael with her, but decides to let Dick decide which one he'd rather have as producer.

At the end of the season, nearly the entire coaching staff and front office (which included Caldwell, as well as Bill and Chris Polian) were fired from the Colts., and Manning was released in March 2012.

Things dissolve quickly after a couple months of being in charge: All of the dishes are rusted through, there is at least a few feet of water in the kitchen and living room, the cops have been called and shooed away at <em>least</em> once, and the food supply is drastically dwindling. Lisa, in a nod to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em>, tries to scare Bart and Homer into doing chores by making them think they have leprosy. Instead of the two actually doing chores, they run to a lepers' colony in Molokai, Hawaii, using all of the Christmas money Ned was saving up to send them there. Lisa does eventually clean the mess up by herself, but it takes the combined efforts of both Marge and Lisa to track Homer and Bart down.

Although <em>L'État, c'est moi</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">apocryphal</a>, while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">last words</a> "I die, but the State remains" are not, the two are not irreconcilable, since there was still a King; after all, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_king_is_dead,_long_live_the_king!">Le roi est mort, vive le roi !<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Or more to the point: <em>L'État, c'est le roi</em>, and Louis happened to be <em>le roi</em> when he supposedly said that.</span> If a noble wanted their state pension and the privileges of nobility, they had to wait on him at Versailles almost constantly rather than remaining on their own estates, while his appointed bureaucrats got on with the business of governance in Paris. Those bureaucrats in turn relied entirely on royal favour to back their authority, as they invariably lacked aristocratic blood of their own. On the foreign front, his strong support for Gallicanism (special liberties for the French Church) meant that the Pope could not alienate him personally without losing France entirely. Notably, and rarely for this trope, his influence even continued after his death — the regency for Louix XV tried to restore the nobility's former rights, only to find that thanks to Louis XIV's long reign (72 years), no-one among the nobility knew how to run so much as a corner shoppe, which left the power Louis XIV once commanded to the very ministries that had relied on his favour for survival.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, this came back to haunt France, in ways Louis XIV could never have imagined, when Louis XV and Louis XVI took the throne. One of the secrets to Louis XIV's success was his keen eye for talent and his skill at managing his ministers. When Louis XV and Louis XVI took over, they proved to be far less competent and the whole system began to rot, before finally exploding in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>.
</li><li> Also, during the brief period between the reigns of Louis XIII (or rather, Cardinal Richelieu) and Louis XIV, the nobles temporarily deposed Mazarin, Richelieu's successor, and ruled France for about a year. It... didn't go so well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> attempted to use this trope in January 1814 in his address to the French Senate, where he admitted that the disastrous outcomes of the campaigns in Russia (1812) and Germany (1813) had been due to his mistakes ("I am not afraid to admit that I made war too much; I made immense project wanting to assure the dominion of the world to France! I was mistaken, these projects were not commensurate to the force of numbers of our population.") But he went on to state he was the only one who could save France in that situation. Unfortunately it then turned out that he couldn't. Fearing that he would lose his throne if he was forced to make any territorial concessions at all, he refused several peace offers more favourable than the terms France eventually got. This led the Allies powers to bury for the rest of the war and ultimately the French military and political leaders to conclude that it was best that Napoleon abdicated.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> had this set up for most of his career. Unfortunately, he came up against a Kaiser who either didn't realise this or just didn't care, and removed the one person keeping everything running (relatively) smoothly.

</li><li> After the Tokugawa Shogunate was overthrown by a coup led by the Daimyōs of Satsuma and Choshu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration">Emperor Mutsuhito/Meiji was "restored" to his position as true political leader of the country</a> (a position it is highly debatable the Japanese Emperor ever <em>held</em>, even historically) as well as cultural/religious figurehead. For the first few decades of his reign, it was the members of his Cabinet who held the real power. But as they died off, the constitution they had laid down left the Emperor in the increasingly critical capacity of power-broker between the army, the navy, the civil service, and the virtually powerless and constantly changing elected government. Meiji was a competent politician, more or less reasonably capable of handling this complicated role as it gradually expanded... But under the less able <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note441ok');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note441ok" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note441ok');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And according to modern sources, probably brain-damaged after barely surviving meningitis as a toddler.</span> Yoshihito/Taishō, the role really became crucial and he struggled to check the military against the newly-ascendant Diet (his reign is called the "Taishō Democracy", as it was the first time the elected government held true power). <em>His</em> successor, Hirohito/Shōwa, was not cut out for the role — he <em>might</em> have had the natural capabilities but was easily manipulated by a few advisors because of his youth, inexperience and eagerness to prove himself. The military came to dominate the government (by 1932 the Prime Minister was little more than a figurehead to be eliminated at the whims of the admirals), and though the army acted on its own in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">Chinese adventures</a>, the government gave them its support.

Facing constant interference in his rule from nobles and royal bureaucrats, he responded by taking an indefinite leave of absence from his duties. After the nobles had made a right mess of things, the people begged him to return and sort things out, which he did. On the condition that he could rule as an absolute monarch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>, who seemed to respect Ivan's example in many things, also seized power by threatening to resign and leave a power vacuum. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Stalin's policy was to purge anybody who made himself indispensable, giving the ideological justification that this trope is antithetical to the principles of communism.</a>
</li><li> Many US Presidents have won re-election largely because they are seen as the only viable option or the "lesser of the two evils". For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>'s 1964 landslide win over Barry Goldwater, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s landslide 1972 win over George McGovern and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s 1984 landslide win over Walter Mondale were as due to voters perceiving the challengers as idiot ideologues that didn't belong anywhere near the Oval Office as to the incumbent's popularity. Or, in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a>'s 2004 win over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry">John Kerry</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>'s 2012 win over Mitt Romney, voters just didn't see the challenger as a viable alternative.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> attempting to invoke this trope on himself led to the Watergate scandal; the Watergate Hotel break-in was part of a larger initiative led by Nixon to sabotage the campaigns of the Democratic primary challengers so that he would face the weakest possible candidate in the election. He succeeded, defeating Democratic challenger George McGovern in one of the biggest landslides in US history. However, subsequent investigations into the break-in discovered this tactic and that Nixon was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> for several rogue groups committing multifarious abuses of power as a means of weakening the Democratic Party, which led to his resignation amid certain impeachment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> has a bit of a <em>different</em> problem after becoming President. He is extremely popular within the Republican Party base, but also extremely divisive amongst independents and outright toxic as far as Democrats are concerned. But the Republican party base is so enamoured with him that it's dangerously close to becoming (if not already) a cult of personality, and that can't possibly last in a system that constitutionally limits any person to only being able to serve two terms as President, and there is also arguably <em>nobody</em> amongst the Republicans able to emulate his ability to bluster his way to "success", nevermind the celebrity/"successful businessman" angle. The moment he leaves office, he will leave a void that a GOP successor will likely have extreme difficulty filling, or a Democrat successor will have <em>absolutely no interest</em> filling, if they aren't outright trying to tear down his legacy entirely.
</li></ul></li><li> On a similar note, many Prime Ministers have held power under similar circumstances:
<ul><li> This trope pretty well applies to Japan's longest-serving Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Rising to power in 2006, he had to resign the office a year later because of health concerns... cue a revolving door of successor Prime Ministers who barely lasted a year in office until Abe regained power in 2012, where he would serve three consecutive terms and have the longest continuous stay in office of any Japanese Prime Minister (who normally only last 2-3 years). While Abe held some controversial positions, his popularity was up and down and his government was pretty scandal-ridden in its later years, he still won landslide re-election victories thanks to a toothless and scattered opposition and the effectiveness of his "Abenomics" economic politics in jolting the Japanese economy out of its decades-long stagnation - until the COVID-19 pandemic tanked it yet again. It was only due to his health going south again that Abe left office in September 2020, leaving Japan's allies in fear that his departure may lead to another period of government instability.
<ul><li> Some may lump Abe's first term in office in with the revolving door of 1 year Prime Ministers who were unable to fill the vacuum that the incredibly popular two-term Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi left when he stepped down in 2006.
</li></ul></li><li> British Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> was always a polarizing figure who never garnered strong approval ratings outside of hardline right-wingers. However, she remained in power for over 11 years and led the Tories to three straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection">Landslide Election</a> victories largely because, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">depending on your political position</a>: the Labour Party came to be associated with economic mismanagement and the cause of the crippling labour strikes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, and soft on national defence, particularly during the Falklands War.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5259b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5259b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5259b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The strikes in of themselves took place even earlier than the Labour governments of the 1970s, and were a large part of why the Heath government collapsed. Labour for its part during the Wilson and Callaghan governments eventually lost faith in Keynesian solutions for the problems facing Britain, culminating in the adoption of the $3.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund in exchange for the initiation of austerity lasting from 1976-9. Callaghan was explicit in his view that spending in the economic downturn was not a solution - declaring this in the 1977 Labour Party Conference. He also suppressed many of the strikes using the police to the point that by 1978, they were no longer a regular feature. After the 1979 election, Labour was led by Michael Foot who did take the party to a much more leftwards position than his predecessor. Foot, was a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, so the accusation that Labour was "soft on defence" stuck during that time.</span>, not to mention the schism that created the (now-defunct) Social Democratic Party which went into alliance with the Liberal Party — which hopelessly divided the opposition vote and gave Thatcher a clear run at power. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6mpxe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6mpxe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6mpxe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Margaret Thatcher was in the early 1980s incredibly unpopular. However, the problems the Labour Party faced were that it was still reeling from the SDP split which took a large share of its votes. Also, something of a media hysteria over the Militant Tendency - a Trotskyist entryist group which managed to burrow itself in the Labour Party in the 1970s - as well as other municipal controversies, brought the Foot leadership no shortage of headaches. With that said, Labour was still projected to win the following election — at least until the aforementioned Falklands War happened. Thatcher, perceived as a strong and uncompromising defender of Britain, enjoyed a resurgence of popularity. Basking from the popularity surge, Thatcher launched a general election a year early, leading the Conservatives into a landslide victory in 1983.</span> Meanwhile, the Liberal Party's (now in alliance with the SDP) election strategy could be best summarized as, "Maggie's poor handling of the economy will surely tank her in the polls any day now, right?" The combined opposition parties' votes always far outstripped that for Thatcher — but it was a split between three parties. Meaning the <em>first past the post</em> system worked in her favour<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note778xx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note778xx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note778xx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For that reason, the SDP-Liberal Alliance, later the Liberal Democrats advocated, and continues to advocate for proportional representation</span>. When she finally fell from power in late 1990, it was at the hands of her own Conservative Party, which came to believe she had finally become too arrogant and hard-headed in light of the Community Charge fiasco and her hysterical view of German reunification and booted her in favor of the more moderate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor">John Major</a>.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Labour, which had begun moving to the centre during most of the 1980s, completed its shift under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a>'s leadership. Blair benefitted from the Major government losing popularity, won an historic mandate in 1997, and then won two more because he had no real opposition to his left while the Conservatives <em>also</em> bungled the task of finding a leader the public could support until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron">David Cameron</a> rose to the top at the end of 2005. When Blair left the premiership in 2007 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GordonBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GordonBrown">Gordon Brown</a> succeeded him, Brown lacked Blair's charisma, had the misfortune of being in charge during the 2007-2009 financial crash, which was incentive enough for the British people to deny him a mandate. Labor would struggle to be competitive in general elections after Blair's departure and after Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the 2019 general election, many commentators noted that if the current Conservative government completes a full term, it will mean that Blair will stand alone as the only person who was able to lead Labour to an election victory within the 50 year span from 1974-2024.
</li><li> World War II-era Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King is the longest-serving Prime Minister since the country's confederation, serving for a cumulative 21 years. Not because he was an inspiring, charismatic leader like his American contemporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>; he was a poor speaker who often came off as being cold and distant, and he had very few, if any, personal friends due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">poor social skills</a>. He retained power so long mainly because he was the only person who had the necessary skills to handle Canada's immediate needs.
</li><li> Similarly, this trope can also apply to 1990s Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Rising to power in 1993 because he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick">Hyper-Competent Sidekick</a> Paul Martin were seen as the only people capable of running the government amid a sea of right-wing ideologues each vying for power upon the fall of long-serving Tory Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Brian Mulroney</a>, and kept the Liberal Party in power for a decade across two more elections largely because his opposition consisted of a Quebec separatist party, a hardline right-winger who couldn't speak any French, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">the New Democratic Party</a>. Indeed, after Chrétien retired in 2003 and the Conservatives were finally able to present a viable alternative in Stephen Harper, the now Paul Martin-led Liberal government was easily toppled and Canada was under Conservative rule for nearly a decade ... for largely similar reasons.
</li><li> And as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Stephen Harper</a> was in power from 2006 to 2015, he could owe his long stay in Ottawa to similar circumstances. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Chrétien walked in 2003</a>, the Liberal Party was plagued by corruption allegations and infighting whilst being under the steward of incompetent leaders while the NDP chewed up their electorate, effectively splitting the left-wing vote in half and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">guaranteeing Harper consistent election victories</a> despite the majority of Canadians disagreeing with him. It wasn't until the NDP moved towards the centre under the late Jack Layton and later Tom Mulcair and Justin Trudeau took charge of the Liberal Party that Harper faced anything resembling viable opposition (leading to his defeat in the 2015 election). And just to solidify the example, the Conservatives couldn't reclaim goverment from a repeatedly stumbling Trudaeu government during the 2019 election, leading the new leader Andrew Scheer to basically resign without a replacement until November 2020 (albiet him remaining in an interim position), and leaving the Conservatives functionally powerless as the Liberals and their partners in minority government proceed to implement their policies without any workable opposition in their way.
</li><li> Current Prime Minister of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel">Israel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminNetanyahu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminNetanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> is the only Prime Minister in the country's history who has won four straight elections, surpassing country founder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidBenGurion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidBenGurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> as Israel's longest serving Prime Minister. While that may suggest he has unimpeachable popularity and respect as a statesman, that's not necessarily the case. Within Israel's borders he is a polarizing figure who is largely seen as a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who has isolated Israel on the world stage and who has been continuously running the economy into the ground. Many other world leaders see him as little more than an agitator who is driving the Middle Eastern peace process backwards (he had a particularly acrimonious relationship with American President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>, then leader of Israel's greatest ally). His belief that Israeli leaders should advocate for all Jews in the world (as articulated in his 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress) outraged a large portion of the Jewish Diaspora. He remains in power largely because in the wake of the increased threat of Islamic terrorism Israel faces due to Hamas taking over the Gaza Strip, Iran looking to develop nuclear weapons and the later rise of ISIS, he is the only person who can competently manage Israel's military and intelligence and protect the country from the violent anarchy that is plaguing the rest of the region. Him overseeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeaceThroughSuperiorFirepower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeaceThroughSuperiorFirepower">extremely effective national security initiatives</a> such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon">Iron Dome</a> hasn't hurt either. His controversial foreign policy of basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">telling the Palestinians to shove it</a> while seeking to come to terms with the rest of the Arab and Muslim world began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">paying huge dividends in 2020</a>, when the oil-rich Gulf states Bahrain and The United Arab Emirates officially recognized Israel and established diplomatic relations, Sudan agreed to recognize Israel for the first time and Saudi Arabia eased off of their hardline anti-Israel positions to what can be described as a pragmatic but begrudging acceptance of Israel's presence and existence.
</li><li> Similarly, former Israeli Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Ariel Sharon</a> alienated his Likud party due to his plans to unilaterally disengage Israeli settlements from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. So he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">left Likud and started his own Kadima party</a> so he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">go ahead with the disengagements anyways</a>. However, after he suffered a major stroke which rendered him a vegetable and the government and Kadima party fell into the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt Politician</a> Ehud Olmert, the government collapsed in a giant cloud of corruption that landed Olmert in jail. As of today, Kadima has no representation in the Knesset.
</li><li> Long-serving Australian Prime Minister John Howard was never strongly liked by the country's population, but he stayed in power for 11 years largely because of mismanagement within the Labor party and the weak leaders it produced. When Labor finally fielded a viable candidate in Kevin Rudd, Howard was booted in spectacular fashion — he is only the second Prime Minister in Australia's history to lose reelection to his seat in parliament (following Stanley Bruce in 1929).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8ce35');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8ce35" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8ce35');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Tony Abbott would become the third in 2019, though at that point he was out of office and serving as a simple backbench MP.</span> Since Howard left, no subsequent Australian Prime Minister has managed to serve a full term in office.

He was lucky that the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, is hardly charismatic, but the fact that Turnbull turned the party around from bloodbath-level polling to a decent lead but then squandered it into a polling situation that could've gone either way in less than a year speaks volumes of how disillusioned voters rapidly became with him.</span> Turnbull was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">him</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">self</a></em> overturned as leader of his party (and PM with it) in 2018 by Scott Morrison,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13hf14');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13hf14" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13hf14');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hilariously, he wasn't even the instigator of the whole mess, it was Peter Dutton who was aiming for the top job and Turnbull willingly stepped down once the spill motion was called rather than contest it himself, but someone screwed up when figuring out the amount of support Dutton had, and it ultimately came down to a head-to-head between Morrison, Dutton and Deputy PM Julie Bishop.

This is partly because China needs better relationships with developed markets for economic reasons, and partly because it wants fewer North Korean refugees trying to escape into its borders.
</li><li> The same thing goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mexico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mexico">Mexico</a>, due to the war against drug cartels Mexico has to deal with, and even before that, due to the PRI party that ruled the country continuously for most of the 20th century: It's better for the U.S. government having to deal with the regime in turn, or helping Mexico with money and weapons to fight against the drug lords than letting Mexico collapse under its own weight, and flooding the U.S. and Canada with <em>millions</em> of refugees escaping from a potential civil war.

Taking into account the aforementioned event, the Islamic State in the Middle East and the refugee crisis in Europe, and that without mention the Russian intervention against the IS in Syria, the <em>last thing</em> the U.S. wants is having a similar crisis with his own southern neighbor at all costs, a crisis that could be used by Russia, China or both countries for their own agendas.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15ohda');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15ohda" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15ohda');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The fact Mexico is the <em>most populated</em> Spanish-speaking country of the region, with 122 million people at 2015, doesn't help things for the U.S. On the other hand, North Korea only have 22 million people, only two million more than Mexico City, <em>the capital</em> of Mexico.

At the same time, all the countries of the region want to resolve the Venezuelan crisis with the less bloodshed as possible, partly because they depend of Venezuelan oil and partly, like the North Korean, Arab and Mexican cases, to avoid a refugee crisis in the American continent and probably <em>direr</em> consequences there.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16ikd0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16ikd0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16ikd0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The situation has been discussed by several ambassadors, presidents and politicians in the region and they all came to the same conclusion: The only way to change the current situation in Venezuela is through a military intervention that would overthrow Nicolas Maduro's government. The only problem with this solution is that the only country that could do so would be the United States and, although the U.S. government would face very little resistance from the Venezuelan military, the main problem with this approach is that any government that emerges once Maduro is kicked out would not have any legitimacy since it would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">puppet government</a> that would serve the interests of the United States, and considering the current political climate in the White House, the last thing many countries in the region, especially in South America, would want is to have a pro-American government under their own noses, after having a pro-Cuban and Pro-Russian one.

</li><li> Mao probably codified this trope; he did this no fewer than <em>three</em> times, leaving the much less talented Politburo/Assembly to mess things up whenever their interference crossed the line. Each time Mao would come back with more power and influence than before.
<ul><li> Deng Xiaoping did him one better. This is the man Mao couldn't get rid of despite all attempts to purge him since he was the only one in the party competent at economic policy. When Mao tried to do his job or get somebody else to do it, China's economy went to the toilet. He was so effective that even though Mao went to great lengths to ensure that Deng would never come to power after his death, Deng still became leader of China anyway.
</li><li> Mind you, he was never <em>officially</em> the leader — he preferred to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a>, controlling the government through the Communist Party's Central Military Commission and Central Advisory Committee. The former's role is very important (every Paramount Leader since Deng has held the position), while the latter, despite its nominally advisory role, was actually the most powerful organ of the Party while it existed; Party wags jokingly called it the "Sitting Committee" (all its members were very old, as one had to have at least 40 years of CPC service to be admitted), in contrast to the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_Standing_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China">Politburo Standing Committee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, (by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation">wonderful coincidence</a>, the pun works in Chinese), which is <em>supposed</em> to be the highest Party organ. This tendency may have been a reaction to Mao's interference. In any case, this definitely helped him secure his indispensability.

</li><li> This seems to be the usual result in Australian politics when a long-serving Prime Minister loses. When the Liberal-National Coalition under Malcolm Fraser was voted in 1983 after eight years in power, the Liberals went through four leaders over the next thirteen years — two of whom (Andrew Peacock and future Prime Minister John Howard) held the job on two non-consecutive occasions. Likewise, when the Labor Party lost power in 1996 after thirteen years under two prime ministers (Bob Hawke and Paul Keating), they went through four leaders over the next twelve years out of power, one of whom (Kim Beazley) held the job on two non-consecutive occasions. Then, when the Coalition under Howard was voted out in 2007 (and Howard lost his parliamentary seat to boot) the Liberals dumped two leaders in two years before settling on Tony Abbott in 2009. Tony Abbott managed to reduce the ruling Labor party's lead in the 2010 election and then led the Coalition to victory in the 2013 election through being an utterly rabid attack dog who ignored the media's 'advice' on political matters in favour for his own convictions, but though he proved to be a competent PM the media had no choice but to encourage a leadership spill favour of Malcolm Turnbull, a man who was regarded very favourably in opinion polls by the sort of people who still had no intention of actually voting for him and the ex-party leader whom Abbott previously succeeded in opposition. Turnbull and his supporters then took the more conservative supporter base of their party for granted and then barely scraped through to win the next election after the so called 'Deluded Conservatives' protested voted out of spite. Turnbull then continued to fail to lift his party's standing to the extent that his leadership ended up significantly breaking the 'Losing Newspoll' metric he himself had used to justify and, after bungling a leadership spill was removed, leading him to quit politics and start a new career self promoting himself on social media. Under the new Morrison leadership the party won the an unwinnable election in the face of all expert analysis and it was opposition leader Shorten and not Morrison that next passed through the revolving door of Australian political party leader.

Soon after he died ethnic tension started building and the leaders of the individual republics took the Presidency in turns, but some people just wouldn't play nicely. Result: no more Yugoslavia.
</li><li> This was the card Cosimo de' Medici played in order to reclaim control of Florence from the Albizzi family. When they overthrew him, instead of trying to immediately reclaim power he simply went into exile for a decade and <em>let</em> the Albizzi rule Florence, knowing that they weren't competent to run the city's finances. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned">As he had calculated</a>, the Florentine economy collapsed from their mismanagement and the population became enraged. Seizing the opportunity, Cosimo returned to Florence and overthrew the Albizzi family with popular support, then organized a witch hunt of all those who had supported his removal.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> satirized this policy when he wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince">The Prince</a></em> from his prison cell as a scathing critique of Lorenzo II de' Medici (descendant of Cosimo and the grandson of the first Lorenzo).
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Florence, after winning the design competition for the dome of the Florence Cathedral, Filippo Brunelleschi had to share leadership of the project with Lorenzo Ghiberti, one of the runners up. Brunelleschi became annoyed at the fact that despite Ghiberti earning the same salary as him and earning equal credit for the project, he left most of the work for Brunelleschi while entertaining himself with other projects. Thus Brunelleschi started taking a large number of "sick days" (though <em>some</em> were legitimate) leaving Ghiberti in charge. Eventually Ghiberti acknowledged he couldn't handle everything himself and quit, leaving Brunelleschi with sole responsibility.
</li><li> Mentioned in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/02/obama_google/">The Register<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<div class="indent"><em>Within a year, Jobs and his NeXT colleagues had purged Apple executives from all the key positions (although the chief accountant remained — which may tell you something about chief accountants).</em>
</div></li><li> Phillip II, King of Castile and Aragon and Sicily, Lord Protector of Navarre, Duke of Milan and the Low Countries — a.k.a. Phillip II of Spain — was famous for his desire to try and administer his territories himself, insofar as that was possible. He would work from dawn to dusk reading reports and signing off paperwork in the process of trying to personally oversee as many state functions as possible. He founded a new governing council to feed him a constant stream of advice and did his best to foster rivalries among the nobilities and principalities. Though he was intelligent and a capable ruler, his realms were just too large and diverse for him to govern effectively, and he was too hesitant and indecisive in governing them. Under his leadership his realms were involved in several costly European wars, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy no less than three times. This gave him and his realms the worst credit rating in all of 16th Century Europe. His son and grandson, however, were not up to his standards and under their leadership the composite monarchy was to suffer as they tried to leave the governing of their realms to "favorites" and governing councils so that they would not have to bear Phillip II's workload and could spend more time enjoying themselves.
</li><li> Major General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy">Quds Force</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekick</a> to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was often seen as the strings that held the unstable Islamic Republic (and its proxies) together. By propping up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BasharAlAssad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BasharAlAssad">Bashar al-Assad</a>, in addition to the Houthi Rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Soleimani effectively transformed the country from a nation at the brink of collapse to a regional powerhouse in the Middle East by using everything from political control to terrorist attacks to even drug trafficking. However, his assassination in 2020 via a drone strike is often seen as an act that may have hindered Iranian influence throughout the area. Left with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongEmpireShriveledEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongEmpireShriveledEmperor">aging and ailing Khamenei</a> (who has as of yet not directly chosen an heir), an increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">luckless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy">President Rouhani</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchySuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchySuccessor">Sketchy Successor</a> in Esmail Qaani and a couple similarly sketchy bureaucrats, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy">Javad Zarif,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Ebrahim Raisi,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Hossein</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Salami</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">the Larijani family</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">fighting for power from within</a>, not to mention a collapsing economy thanks to heavy sanctions and a COVID-19 plague, the future of the Republic and its substantial influence in the Middle East after Soleimani's death remains uncertain at best.
</li><li> Subverted by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-14129187">Ahmed Wali Karzai<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Half-brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, he was for all intents and purposes the boss of Kandahar. Recognized by both friend and foe as indispensable, and known for being a pretty decent ruler by nepotistic warlord standards. He was nevertheless assassinated, probably by people who felt that instability and a poorly-run Kandahar were in their interest.
</li><li> No matter how grandly-titled an organization's official leaders are likely to be, odds are pretty good that it's their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">secretaries/personal assistants/aides</a> who do most of the essential paperwork and know what's really going on.
<ul><li> Doubly true for IT managers when management is for all intents and purposes tech-blind, as most don't consider the position to be important outside moments when things collapse. The irony comes from such moments of collapse coming when one such IT manager is let go, only for them to be patiently waiting for the invitation back in, often with an increased salary. Some try to enforce this trope by introducing systems that would collapse without them simply pushing a button every day. When programmers do this it's called a time bomb or logic bomb (as they would have their status as fired to be the exact trigger for an orchestrated collapse, usually when employee records are kept in a digital medium). Obviously, such practices are highly illegal and frowned upon.
</li></ul></li><li> Cleaning staff (for offices) and garbage collectors (for cities in particular). Having the entire city's garbage collectors go on a week long strike makes you inclined to listen to their demands when the garbage starts piling up within a day.
</li><li> According to some management principles, this is actually a <em>bad</em> thing to encourage in an organization. If the leader is suddenly sidelined due to illness, death or other unforeseen issues, the organization can be left scrambling to fill the roles the leader played. Having a clearly delineated succession plan can help so the other people in the organization know what to do in case the boss is suddenly out of commission.
</li><li> The same thought process applies to forms of governance that emphasize the importance of peaceful transfer of power even when you dislike your successor. The effectiveness <em>of</em> this mindset varies, as this section showcases.
</li><li> Militaries go out of their way to make this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied Trope</a>. Soldiers are taught from the very beginning that all leaders must consider themselves replaceable and ensure the unit can still function <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">if they are killed or otherwise incapacitated</a>.
</li><li> In retrospect, America <em>really</em> should not have overthrown Saddam Hussein. His secular political platform and vision of national unity, as well as his brutal repression of dissent or insurrection prevented the religious extremists from tearing the country apart in sectarian conflicts and then exporting the chaos everywhere as unfortunately happened after the botched occupation. At the VERY least, the US should not have disbanded the Iraqi Army, which was pretty much the only integrated institution seen as a point of national pride.
</li><li> Some have said that the Western coalition shouldn't have helped to topple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>, either; however, unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a> (who was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">generically being nasty to his citizens</a>), Gaddafi had already provoked his people into open revolt long before the West got involved with the Libyan resistance, and the rebels were pretty well entrenched in Benghazi. It's unlikely that the current situation would be any less violent without foreign intervention; at best, Gaddafi's regime would be weakened with occasional outbreaks of violence and unrest, and at worst Libya would have descended into a protracted full-scale civil war like Syria. As it happens, that happened anyway, but at least Gaddafi didn't get a chance to engage in mass murder, and (with the exception of the fairly-weak-if-still-terrifying local branch of ISIS) the sides in the present conflict generally try to avoid committing atrocities against the civilian population.
</li><li> In some places, long-haul truck drivers have this. More than a few have drug or alcohol issues during their careers and many have various misdemeanors as well. But it's difficult for companies to find a capable long-haul driver, which explains companies overlooking most infractions and the high wages plus pay per mile bonuses.
</li><li> In engineering, this is sometimes known as the "bus factor," i.e. how many people can be hit by a bus without the team losing critical skills and/or stop functioning altogether. The higher the bus factor, the better. A low bus factor is a sign of a team that can suddenly become nonfunctional if the wrong workers take a sick day.
</li><li> Insects and other invertebrates manage to play dozens of extremely vital roles in the environment, from pollinating, pest control, food sources and so on. We tend to find them annoying or insignificant, but if they were to disappear, life as we know it would cease to function.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveJobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveJobs">Steve Jobs</a>, despite not being really liked by some of his coworkers, was indispensable to Apple: they tried to fire him once, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">and it was catastrophic to the company</a>. And while Apple struggled to keep their part of the market, Steve Jobs bought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> — one of the most successful animation studios. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Jobs' death in 2011</a>, some think this trope has fallen back into effect for Apple, as they think Apple's not as creative or innovative as they were before.
</li><li> This can be a frequent problem in Alcoholics Anonymous and similar fellowships. Every 12-step group is supposed to operate independently of any other similar group, which means that it's very easy for smaller groups to develop an entrenched leadership that stays in power either because the leader has turned into such a tyrant that membership has dwindled to the point that there's nobody to replace them, or because the leader has done such a good job that the other members become dependent upon them. For this reason, most 12-step groups include rules calling for monthly elections.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, despite being an authoritarian military dictator, managed to keep the entire Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, united under his rule. This is made more impressive by the fact the KMT was actually more of a non-aligned/centrist political coalition with various bickering wings, ranging from liberal to conservative to traditionalist. In one case, Chiang 'retired' on 10 December 1931 during a particularly stressful period. Within hours, military officers refused to obey the new government, public protests demanded Chiang to come back, the entire government panicked and tax offices refused to submit forms without Chiang's return.
</li><li> Churches often struggle with this, depending on their internal leadership structure and their denominational hierarchy (or lack thereof). Leaders, whether ministers or elders, can become entrenched in a congregation, so much so that when the wrong people leave, retire, or die, the church splits or disintegrates because nothing stronger was holding it together.
</li><li> The examples are too numerous to count, but businesses have long faced this trope and have tools to deal with it.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs">Golden Handcuffs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are when a valuable employee has excellent compensation which may be lost if they stop working. Thus, if that valuable officer or employee thinks of leaving, they will have to reconsider because they would lose a lot of money. For example, their compensation is technically a stack of bonuses that can be <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clawback">clawed back<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> if they fail to remain with the company.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/key-person-insurance">Key Person Insurance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is insurance that can be taken out on a critical employee by the business. If that employee dies or is disabled, the payoff from the insurance goes to the business. This allows the business to either find a way to replace that person and get back to work or else close down in an orderly manner. A restaurant, for example, might pay off everyone and pay its debts if the chef holding it down dies, while a bank that loses a critical employee might use the cash to stabilize and find someone who can fill the role.
