However, the more interesting something is, the more likely it falls victim to the rule of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">You can't use it often enough</a>, it costs too much, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">it just takes too much effort to get it</a>. You could even have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a>, where it just looks awesome, but that is about it.
</p><p>Therefore, we have things that are much more "boring" and normal, but these things often contribute more to your success in the long term than the visually more impressive things. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReliableOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReliableOne">The Reliable Ones</a>, if you will — and proof that Hollywood <em>does not always</em> hate boring. Often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">Mundane Solution</a>. As the list below shows, this trope doesn't require that a non-boring counterpart exists.
</p><p><strong>Things that will frequently fall into this trope</strong>:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><ul><li> Defensive abilities, strategies, builds, classes, or playstyles, especially in competitive games and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> - the most straightforward way to get ahead of someone is to take fewer losses than they do or replace your losses faster. Preventing damage, producing resources and delivering them (economy and logistics), preventing the opponent from acting whenever possible, gaining intel, forcing confrontation on your own terms, and doing all of this as efficiently as possible, are all time-honored principles with a lot less flash and glamour than overwhelming offense, yet the better part of Boring But Practical applications in real or competitive environments rely on these and similar concepts. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>.
</li><li> Weapon loadouts that don't require much ammunition or allow you put a <em>ton</em> of ammunition on your vehicle in things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> combat sims. The bigger guns tend to be unable to stock much ammo and take up more space, besides.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> in coöperative games, whether that be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">TabletopRPGs</a>,<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMOs</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FPS">FPSes</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Fiery doom</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">big swords</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">raining bullets</a> are a lot cooler, but try getting anywhere without a dedicated healer in your group. (A lot of video games try to circumvent this by giving healing spells effects just as spectacular as their offensive counterparts, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightTheWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightTheWay">big shining lights</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">summoning gods</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">killing zombies</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">massive plant growth</a>).
</li><li> Buffing and debuffing abilities. "Why use these when you can attack right away," you ask? Raising your stats (particularly defense and evasion) and lowering the enemy's (particularly attack and accuracy) can make the difference between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> hitting only half of your party for damage that can be healed back up promptly and that same attack causing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>.
</li><li> Passive abilities in games with customization involved. The kind of ability that's always on, and carries you through trouble. Sure, that big hellfire that fills half the screen and uses a high amount of resources looks cool and you see big numbers on the screen, but the +5% fire damage passive ability combined with your usual fire attacks improves your damage much more over time as you use it.
</li><li> All the behind-the-scenes stuff in strategy games. You might be itching to generate as many Panzer divisions or equivalent as they possibly can in order to roll over things with the high-end glamorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a>, but if you don't pay attention to the boring stuff - your supply and support network, the boring logistics that needs lots and lots of boring trucks - then you're doomed once the panzers start running out of fuel and ammo.
<ul><li> This is a lesson drummed into trainee army officers: "The teeth of an army are as nothing without its tail". If every German panzer division in the Blitzkrieg required a logistics train whose less glamorous vehicles - many horse-drawn - would have stretched for <em>a hundred miles</em> behind the Panzers if placed nose-to-tail. It took several <em>thousand</em> lorries to keep the six <em>hundred</em> tanks of an armored division in the battle. Hitler's Ardennes offensive of 1944 failed because he was obsessed with using tanks to spearhead it — and paid scant heed to the logistics trains necessary to sustain them.
</li><li> "Amateurs study tactics, armchair generals study strategy, professionals study logistics."
</li></ul></li><li> In strategy games, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Units</a> and by extension the stuff they build. These guys have little or no combat capability, present easy targets for your enemies, and what they make usually just sit in place passively generating resources, but without them you have no economy, and without an economy, you have no army. Workers are also used as early-game scouts due to starting the game with several of them, and having a very low cost per unit.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>: they may lack the coolest, or strongest moves, but are fairly good at most attributes, and lack the glaring weaknesses of other character types.
</li><li> The elementaries:
<ul><li> Basic attacks and moves. Special moves and magic are a lot more flashy and generally much more effective, but they are usually restricted by something or other (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired">a complex button combo</a> or has long prep time, etc.) And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">some spells might not even work</a> when you really need them. Normal attacks usually cost nothing at all to use, and have no cooldown or speed penalty.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: In martial arts complex and flashy moves look good, but they are often difficult to execute, require a lot of training, and, if failed, often leave you open for a counterattack. Many masters discourage their use even in tournaments, and in a common street brawl you can do very well with just a couple of boxing punches.
</li></ul></li><li> In platformers, Goomba Stomp or basic moves, as opposed to the things you can do with powerups. Vital since the said powerups aren't always available, and if you lose yours mid-level, what then?
</li><li> Your most basic combat units, typically some kind of infantry, is usually more efficient than the larger (and cooler looking) counterparts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay">Tournament players</a> will often make heavy use of rather basic units in general. Any type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">rush</a> depends on this trope.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense">Tower Defense</a> Games, whatever the "basic" tower is may be this; they are cheap, dependable, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">easy to fill the map with</a>. But they are nowhere near as cool as many other towers in your arsenal.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardGames">Card Games</a>, simple and resource-cheap cards often reign supreme, with efficiency being more important than raw power. Common-rarity cards also tend towards this: rare cards typically have powerful and unique effects... but it'll be rare in and of itself for anyone to have more than one, making them useless if countered. Common cards may have simpler effects, but they're easy to get and can easily be used multiple times.
</li></ul></li><li> In competitive circles, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame-defined</a> optimal manner of play that may not be the most exciting way to play, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">you're going to see that same strategy / character / build / whatever used over and over</a>, but it's the one that achieves the best results in the extremely restrictive circumstances.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> that's a few notches down from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> but often takes significantly less effort to get, especially if it's a weapon you earn as part of the plot rather than a long or difficult sidequest.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">TabletopRPG</a>, the characters placing themselves into positions that offer decent protection, slow the enemy down, or give another advantage, can be very useful. For instance, in a narrow corridor or tunnel, if it's found that enemies are coming, placing the designated Tank (Fighter or Paladin with heavy armor, or the beefy Barbarian, or someone with a high Armor Class and/or Hit Points, or a Summoned creature) between the party and the enemy can allow the squishier magic and ranged attackers to fight from a safe distance, while the tank soaks up the damage and dishes out their own. Likewise, knowing when to be a Substitute Tank is also a good idea if the enemy proves to be more numerous than expected and the Main Tank is in a world of hurt.

<ul><li> This is the mantra of the titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em>. If it isn't the practical, least-flashy decision, he's not interested.
<ul><li> Goblin Slayer's equipment looks pretty shabby and worn even compared to the gear of most rookies, but it gets the job done. Other silver-level adventurers look down on him partly because his equipment isn't as fancy as theirs. The thing is, it doesn't need to since he's only hunting goblins and it's also easily replaceable, though he prefers to get it repaired.
</li><li> Goblin Slayer doesn't even <em>clean</em> his armor and weapons beyond wiping off any excess blood and viscera, since goblins have a very sharp sense of smell. They smell the clean metal of a weapon, they think warriors are coming; they smell blood and guts, they think business as usual. And that's where Goblin Slayer gets the jump on them.
</li><li> An apprentice blacksmith asks his master why Goblin Slayer doesn't invest in enchanted weapons, and is told that magic weapons would be overkill against the typical horde, and that the magical aura and flashy aftereffects of most enchantments would just give Goblin Slayer away to the goblins and utterly undermine his stealth-focused extermination methods. Also, the Goblin Slayer uses average quality gear, to avoid the goblins getting their hands on good gear in the case he dies to them. No one enjoys facing little buggers wearing high-quality gear looted from their last victim.
</li><li> In the <em>Brand New Day</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a>, Goblin Slayer indirectly advises Rookie Warrior about using clubs as a replacement weapon, reasoning that clubs are easy to use and do not have the risk of chipping unlike swords. Rookie Warrior acknowledges when using a club in the sewers later that it's effective as a weapon, although not very flashy.
</li><li> In one part of the story, goblins take over an old elven tree-fortress. Goblin Slayer just seals the entrance and sets the whole thing on fire. His business is <em>killing</em> goblins, not <em>fighting</em> them. Sure there might be captives inside, but he's not about to risk his life and the lives of his comrades (and not to mention waste time and resources) trying to save people who are probably already dead or, given all the things goblins do to their captives, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">wish they were</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Although Naruto makes extensive use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">all two of his advanced jutsu</a>, he's ended most of his fights in the entire series thus far by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustShootHim">just punching the guy</a>. In some cases, this was necessitated by him using up most of his chakra using his advanced jutsu.
</li><li> There's also Shikamaru's shadow manipulation jutsu, which never changes its basic function throughout the series (ensnaring and controlling people with their shadows), yet Shikamaru uses it efficiently and in a variety of methods. Overall, he's definitely a boring fighter, but far more practical at getting the job done than many others.
<ul><li> Though for the first half of the series his technique is really more boring but useless. It requires him to be motionless to use. Shikamaru can only stretch it as as far as his shadow is long (meaning both that his technique is dependent on the environment and that it's easy for an enemy to see it coming). He's stuck making the same motions his enemy does even if he catches the enemy, and even if all that fall into place perfectly, the enemy could potentially just flat out be strong enough to over power it. He compares how useless his ability is with how it took him several episodes of constant planning and tactics to still fail with the technique, while Temari won with a single move.
</li></ul></li><li> This is also why Kakashi has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverShadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverShadowedByAwesome">Over Shadowed By Awesome</a>. His signature skill is an electricity fueled punch in a series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping">Reality Warping</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">unquenchable black flames</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">giant monsters almost literally made of pure energy.</a> His approach to summoning is a perfect example. Most people summon massive creatures to fight for them, Kakashi summons hunting hounds, who are much more useful for a ninja in most situations.
</li><li> Kunai are excessively boring, compared to the high powered pseudo-magic jutsus. Still, stabbing a guy is a great way to mess up his day.
</li><li> Tsunade is incredibly dull compared to other S-rank ninja who almost all use immensely impressive ninjutsu to fight. Instead, she uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> which make her physically stronger than anyone else and capable of tanking nearly any attack respectively.
</li><li> One of Kakashi's first lessons to his team involves focusing their chakra to their feet so they can climb up walls, with a more advanced version allowing them to stand on water. The real utility of this is how it improves one's chakra control, which is essential for making one's jutsus more effective and chakra-efficient.
</li><li> Taijustu in general. It's less showy or impressive than ninjutsu and genjutsu but when used effectively, it can be effective when one person runs out of chakra to perform the other two.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ichigo, who in a world where shikais and bankais give elemental abilities to weapons, turn them into entirely different weapons, summon giant poison baby familiars, has a shikai that simply fires off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">sword beams</a> of varying levels of power and a bankai that takes his already considerable physical strength and speed and amps them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li><li> Most Captains utilize their Bankai to turn around a fight that's going against them. Kenpachi Zaraki? Holds his sword with both his hands and use kendo, rather than swinging it around like a madman. He generally doesn't like to use it <em>because</em> it's so boring, but it takes him from 'terrifyingly powerful' to 'nigh unstoppable'.
</li><li> Hanataro's zanpakuto is useless for fighting, but its ability to heal any wound it "slashes" makes it the perfect medical device. Course, this summarizes Hanataro's boring yet greatly underappreciated character; not a fighter in any form of the word, yet one of the best healers in the Gotei 13. For example, he was the one who brought Renji back to full form <em>after the latter was beaten and nearly torn apart by Byakuya several times over</em>.
<ul><li> Sure, Hanataro is an amazing healer, but he only did the patch up work after Byakuya ripped Renji in half. He outright says that some one else (his Captain, Retsu Unohana) did most of the work.
</li></ul></li><li> Gin Ichimaru's bankai is this. His sword at basic can hit you from a distance. His bankai upgrades this to roughly 13 km, and extend/ contract at near hypersonic speeds, making it essentially a handheld railgun/sniper rifle combo. Lastly, he later reveals that it has a cell-destroying poison that WILL dissolve on verbal command. To top it off, given his tendency to outright lie or omit details about his powers, then he can win virtually any battle easily by nicking you once.
</li><li> Yamamoto's bankai, Zanka No Tachi. Far from the most visually impressive bankai in the series, but with destructive power far beyond what most are capable of, even with just its passive abilities.
</li><li> For the characters of any race in general, their natural ability is this. Certainly, Shinigami and Quincy have various powerful spells at their disposal, but a number of them require incantations and/or preparation to cast at full power, which leaves such spells as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> if you aren't a master at using them. On the other hand, a person's natural ability (Zanpakuto or Schrift) is generally their first resort in battle, and the most effective one in an intense battle where the time to prepare spells doesn't exist.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> it's suggested that the main reason Team Touden succeeds where other parties fail is the simple fact that they eat well and get regular sleep, where said other adventurers survive off rations and delve 24/7.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindedByTheLight">Taiyouken/Solar Flare</a> technique introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. It's the most generally useful technique in the entire story because it doesn't rely on power levels. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">the Z-Fighters were more pragmatic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim">a whole lot of story arcs would be a whole lot shorter</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that after Goku's battle against Beerus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</a></em>, he reached the conclusion that it is overall better to just train his base and Super Saiyan forms to become stronger instead of relying on transformations, since Super Saiyan 2 and 3 are little more than extensions to the normal Super Saiyan form that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">ultimately drain more energy in the long run</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> the transformations Goku uses regularly are his Super Saiyan form and his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, which is just Super Saiyan merged with godly energy. He does use Super Saiyan 2 and even goes Super Saiyan 3 to showoff to Future Trunks, but Super Saiyan 2 is treated an in-between transformation that Goku uses when he wants to test opponents who surpass him as a regular Super Saiyan.
<ul><li> Even earlier, he became strong enough to go toe-on-toe with Cell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> not with bulked-up transformations like Ascended or Ultra Super Saiyan, but by mastering the basic form: ASSJ increases the power but at cost of consuming stamina and power much faster, and USSJ grants power even greater than Super Saiyan 2 but consumes stamina and power even faster and reduces speed too, while simply mastering the basic form reduces <em>ki</em> consumption (and thus power and stamina ones) to negligible levels, to the point one can keep it up in their <em>sleep</em>, and the greater <em>ki</em> availability gives enough power and speed increase to surpass ASSJ <em>as a side effect</em>. Also, it negates the usual wild emotions, allowing the fighter to <em>think straight</em> (with the inability of thinking straight as ASSJ being what led Vegeta to be defeated by Cell).
</li></ul></li><li> Anyone going against 17 or 18 needs to be massively stronger than them, or they'll find themselves falling at their favorite tactic: simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByEndurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByEndurance">outlast the enemy</a> thanks to the fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMotionMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMotionMonster">they never run out of energy</a>. They like this tactic so much they use it even when they don't need it, as shown in the fight between Vegeta and 18 when the latter, in spite of being stronger enough to break his arm with a kick, simply let Vegeta tire himself out until he gave her an opening, at which point she kicked his left arm.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Holyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Holyland">Holyland</a></em> fights end after the second or third exchange and a character (Izawa) constantly reminds everyone else that basic movements are the best option; he claims that he doesn't do it because it looks cool, but because it's the safest way to go. Two of the best examples are Yuu's second fight with Osada and his spar with Yamazaki:
<ul><li> Osada is bigger, stronger, and has longer reach than Yuu... But is a full-contact Karateka whose style has relatively limited reach. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Yuu's self-made style</a>, however, is based on Boxing, thus his jab has a slightly greater reach, allowing him to get the upper hand by using <em>nothing but jabs</em>, as using anything else would be too dangerous. An onlooker even complains about this because he was expecting more from the fight.
<ul><li> Osada had previously been at the dishing end of this: when fellow Karateka Shougo won a spar by using street-fighting techniques Osada started imposing him rules that put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse">the much shorter Shougo</a> at a reach disadvantage.
</li></ul></li><li> Even after deciding to eliminate rules on account of Yuu having no experience in <em>regulated</em> Boxing, Yamazaki nearly wins because, as a Boxer, his training regime gave him far greater stamina than Yuu, nearly allowing him to simply outlast his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">non-formally trained opponent</a>.
<ul><li> Yuu later falls afoul of this again during his first fight with Yoshito, a kickboxer, who is also more skilled as a boxer and a kicker-kicks being what barely allowed Yuu to beat Yamazaki. For the rematch Yuu had Yamazaki train him as a boxer, with the training including aerobic exercises that fixed that issue.
</li><li> The finaly of the manga has Yuu, who had survived many brutal street fights throughout the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being nearly killed by a random desperate kid armed with a switchblade. Turns out even the best street-fighters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBringAKnifeToAFistFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBringAKnifeToAFistFight">can</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">buy it to muggers</a> if they have the advantage of surprise.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mazinger's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Photon Beams</a> are one of the most boring weapons of the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, lacking from the inherent visual awesomeness and raw power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Rocket Punch</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster">Breast Fire</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Rust Hurricane</a>. However it is Mazinger-Z's most used weapon in the series. Why? Because they are powerful enough to have the work done, cost-efficient and can be shot many times in quick sucession (Kouji can't use Mazinger's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Moves</a> recklessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">because they overheat his robot and consume a lot of energy</a>). Also, in the original manga Kouji dealt with the enemy by punching it and kicking it and using a weapon to finish it more often than not. Less spectacular? Certainly. Effective, regardles? Definitely.
<ul><li> Of course, this doesn't hold true in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger">Shin Mazinger</a></em>, where the Photon Beams become straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode Kouji could not use Mazinger-Z since the Pilder was destroyed. So he destroyed one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Monsters</a> of Archduke Gorgon by planting landmines and luring it to step on them. Not so impressive like a giant robot, but effective.
</li></ul></li><li> In the same vein that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> example, the various vulcan cannons in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> metaseries. They're too weak to completely defeat an enemy mobile suit, but their primary purpose is shooting down enemy aircraft and missiles, which conserves ammunition for stronger targets.
<ul><li> One rare case where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">the vulcans DO work</a> is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em>, where one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Mecha of the Week</a> is the very definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, literally shedding everything except the parts that were absolutely necessary to operate in order to give it incredible running speed. Garrod couldn't hit it with his beam rifle, but his vulcans tore through it like paper.
</li><li> Nine times out of ten, the Earth-based factions tend to run on this trope, keeping to one type of Mobile Suit and giving it different variants over the flashier suits that are spat out by those in space. Of note are the GMs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> and the GN-Xs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>. The GM is the original mass-produced version of the Gundam and variants of it exist all the way to at least the era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em>. Even the Jegan, introduced in that movie, is derived from the GM. They have no transformation gimmicks or heavy weaponry or built for Newtypes; they're just normal Mobile Suits with standardized weaponry. The GN-X were essentially the Earth forces' means to catch up with Celestial Being's Gundams, even if their power source was an incomplete version of what the Gundams used. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer">Gundam 00: A Wakening of the Trailblazer</a></em>, they've gone up to a GN-X IV and most of those <em>are just refurbished GN-X units that made it all the way to that state</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters">Gundam Build Fighters</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry">Gundam Build Fighters Try</a></em> go out of its way to avert this trope. As Meijin Kawaguchi III is fond of saying, "Gunpla is freedom!", meaning that you can do whatever you want with your model and trying to constrain your ideas within the boundaries of the original <em>Gundam</em> canon just limits your potential. So "straight builds" will just get wrecked by the girl who combined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Victory Gundam</a> with one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Impulse Gundam</a>'s weapon packs, the guy who gave the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Strike Gundam</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption">energy-absorbing shield</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> that lets it pull off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">Megaton Punch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, or the guy who turned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">ZZ Gundam</a> into an old-school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Combining</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Rocket Punches</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>.
<ul><li> On the other side of the coin, sometimes straight-builds can still perform well, but this mainly because more mundane factors (like build quality, the operator's fighting skills, and good old-fashioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">determination</a>) help bridge the gap.

(of various levels of sophistication) called Intelligent Devices. However, most mages in the universe of the series instead use Storage Devices, which have no A.I. and are limited to only one active form and one inactive form, but apparently process magic faster.
<ul><li> Binding Spells are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> spell of the entire series. Its function is only to restrict movement, which looks very underwhelming compared to some of the bigger spells shown in the series. It also comes up just about instantly, can be casted pre-emptively, and getting hit by one can spell doom since it opens up the victim to a bigger spell to hit them. In the series itself, variations of binding spells have been used throughout the series as way to secure criminals, or as a key spells in some of the fights in the series. It was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a> of Chrono, which he used to handily defeat the much stronger Fate in a mock battle, and its frequently used by Nanoha to ensure that her big spells will hit, such as the Starlight Breaker, or to buy some time in combat.

For people who want to raise a family, the stable, secure job of an office drone is a much better way to go, with benefits like a health plan and a pension making things easier for you in the long run.

However, he makes up for this by simply studying a lot about cooking techniques and various dishes that would be long forgotten by the other characters. The fruits of his studying finally showed during the Autumn Election when he scored 88 points, surpassing even Mito Ikumi, an established strong contender for the Autumn Election. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The victory was short lived however when Subaru Mimasaka surpassed him in the end.</span>
<ul><li> Soma himself walked this path when battling Nene Kunokini. While Nene made beautiful hand-made noodles, Soma used a machine. While this earned him a lot of ridicule from the spectators, those involved in the match saw this for the very clever move it was. Soma could never make noodles of Nene's quality, and would more likely than not mess up making them by hand. However, by using the machine, he could very quickly make <em>adequate</em> noodles, and move on to the parts of the dish he could match Nene in.

They often balance out the fact they don't gain special powers or spells with the advantage of learning more Feats than other classes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a></em>, most people will try to learn the flashy openings and glitzy combo attacks, but the tactics of piece exchange should come in second place to the logistic considerations of controlling board space. It sounds boring, but it pays to know when to crack open the defense of a turtling player or to suffocate an aggressive attacker with a locked pawn center.
<ul><li> Many famous players, such as Wilhelm Steinitz, Tigran Vartanovich Petrosian, Jose Raul Capablanca, and Vladimir Kramnik, had playing styles that could be described this way. They rarely played flashy combinations or won brilliancy prizes, but their mastery of solid positional play allowed them to consistently score great results, to the point of becoming World Champions.
</li><li> Some openings for white like the London system or the similar Colle system have negative reputations as being "lazy" "boring" or "dull" openings. But they are easy to learn and offer white good, quick development, a solid pawn structure and decent defense, making them practical, particularly for less experienced players. "System" openings in general are seen by some players as boring and repetitive since the player usually performs the exact same moves in (mostly) the exact same order every single game with little to no variation no matter what moves their opponent makes, which can be seen as unimaginative and lazy.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go">Go</a></em>, there are dozens of standard sequences called <em>joseki</em>, i.e. "best move". Playing them out according to the standard may seem boring to a junior player, but the reason they became standard in the first place is that they provide both sides with usable structures and "fair share" of the area where it is played.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em> a fairly common tactic among experienced players is to buy up the (light) purple, orange, and red properties.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk">Risk</a></em>, Australia is the continent of choice for many veterans for locking down early then slowly amassing the 2 reinforcements per round.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a></em>, sneaky check-raise traps, big risky bluffs, and hero-calling a suspected bluffer are all big fun moves... but the most reliable way to build your stack, especially against middling opposition, is to fold a lot, make small-to-medium-sized bets to take the blinds and antes when you're in position and no one else seems particularly interested in them, and save your big plays for when you've got a very strong hand.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> boardgame, Legal missions tend to be this. They don't pay as well as the big bank heists and mine robberies, but they also don't risk the Misbehave deck, sparing you the risk of spending hundreds of dollars on bribes, getting an automatic fail (and, if a Niska job, the loss of a crewman) from a Warrant being issued, or getting your crew killed.
</li><li> The XCOM Board Game has several Boring But Practical assets. How useful thy are depends on the invasion plan.
<ul><li> The Skyranger sees a lot of use in Infiltration and Domination. Enemies in Infiltration are extremely weak, but the Infiltration plans throws a lot of crises at you, which generally wrecks havoc with your logistics. Thus you have a lot of spare soldiers. Domination enemies are not quite as weak, but the main battle in Domination happens in the air. Removing crises with spare soldier thus gets very useful.
</li><li> Technologies. Researching a technology requires you to roll 1, 2 or 3 successes. Some technologies allow to research technologies faster, and pulling them early lets you snowball.
<ul><li> 1 success technologies usually involve placing an undeployed unit on it to generate some benefits. These units aren't considered deployed and cost you nothing. One tech allows you to assign undeployed scientists to raft Interceptors for free. One allows you to use undployed Satellites for credits. For how cheap they are, they can turn a game around.
</li><li> 2 successes technologies usually allow you to claim free successes or to save units that should be destroyed. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">SHIV</a> can by itself trivialize the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFnalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFnalDungeon">FinalMission</a> and many regular missions, and on any invasion plan that's light on UFOs, the technology that allows you to deal two damage to enemies by usig undeployed interceptors can make missions much lss dangerous.

However, as his power comes from his eyes, it means that, no matter what, he will always hit his target if he can see them, and because of his personality, he's trained his body to be an expert martial artist (meaning that, without his powers, he's essentially Batman without a utility belt or any hangups about guns, which serves well when he's left without his powers).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik New Adventures</a></em> he has access to much more advanced technology than in the 'classic' stories, most iconic of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon">Extransformer Shield</a>, with multiple functions and weapons. What are the features he uses most often? <em>Extensible punch of increased power, a better paralizing beam</em>, and the shield, the most boring of all (with two being his old iconic weapons in an improved version), without even bothering with the flashier functions most of the time. Also, he's prone to whip out his old tricks, such as the Car-can (memory-erasing candy. Not as sophisticated as Everett Ducklair's amnesia beam, but just as effective), the rockets on his belt, and a small ball that produces a very bright flash such as the Tayoken of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s fame (and he dropped a <em>demolition ball</em> on the enemy while he was blinded).
</li><li> Also from <em>Paperinik New Adventures</em>: the Evronians have a penchant for whipping out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> with such features as beastly strength and claws, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> that make you live your worst fears and turn them into a slave by <em>eating them</em> while having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and toughness, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Shapeshifting</a>, and more... But at the end of the day the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">standard warriors</a> proved superiors to all but the Augmented Units, that are no more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">standard warriors twice as large</a>, with the others being no more than niche warriors.
<ul><li> Speaking of Evronians, we have Trauma. He's the one with the psychic powers and the strength, but the ability that allowed him to nearly defeat Paperinik was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceChangeling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceChangeling">imitating a woman's voice</a></em>: after being matched and even slowly losing a straight fight, he retreated and used his previously unknown ability to imitate voices to lay a trap and wreck the psychic-repellant helmet of Paperinik's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, allowing him to finally use his psychic powers. Not that his goal was that: in another example of the trope, he was actually trying to kick Paperinik down a tall building to simply <em>kill</em> him, and only wrecked the helmet because Paperinik dodged at the last moment.
</li><li> Then there's the precautions they take in case some of their super soldiers rebel: the beast warriors have a brainwashing chip secretly installed in their helmets, the Augmented Units have large numbers of guns trained at their back, the formidable underwater warriors can't breathe air, the cyborg with the firepower of a battalion has a remote-controlled <em>off switch</em> (and it's implied that when he mutinied his handlers simply activated it, considering how <em>pissed</em> he is when he mentions it), and so on.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> comic, this is the reason why the Clone Saga happens: sure, Spider-Man isn't as powerful or recognizable as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>, but considering every single attempt at replicating Cap has been an utter, epic, <em>horrifying</em> failure, the Ultimate Universe's version of the Hulk is an uncontrollable malevolently sentient weapon of mass destruction that is one of these aforementioned failures, and Spidey's powers are a pretty adaptable jack-of-all-trades package that soldiers and intelligence operatives can find useful in most scenarios they will encounter, then it's just better to go for that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out that the man behind the cloning project is Otto Octavius and the reason he did it was just for the sake of screwing with Peter, but it's never said whether or not the actual pitch was just a bluff.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, Klara's ability to control plants isn't terribly impressive when compared to Nico's magic, Molly's super-strength, or Karolina's light-based powers, but on the other hand, she's been using her powers since she was a child and thus knows how to use them, they don't have a blood or energy cost like Nico's magic or Molly's powers, and they deploy quickly.
</li><li> Of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFantasticFour">The Fantastic Four</a>, Sue Storm—aka Invisible Woman—has frequently been the target of this trope. Compared with the Thing's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and literal rocky exterior which grants him nigh-invulnerability, her husband Reed's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a> abilities and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">Super Intelligence</a>, and brother Johnny Storm/Human Torch's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Playing with Fire</a> powers and flight, her gifts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">turning invisible</a> and conjuring force fields seem rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">lame</a>. However, once writers figured out what to do with her powers (she was essentially just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> for most early stories), they quickly became the most useful on the team, though they didn't get any flashier. Enemy giving you trouble? Either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">create a force field</a> <em>inside their body</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">expand it</a>, or, as was the case with She-Hulk, summon a field around their head, cutting off their air supply (even the biggest foes still need to breathe). Sue's creative use of her "boring" powers has made her not just the strongest member of the Four, but among Marvel heroes in general—she once <em>single-handedly took on and defeated</em> Thundra, the Absorbing Man, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> Hulk and Thing—in that case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Sue's daughter Valeria was in danger</a>—and to date, Sue is the only mortal, mutant or otherwise, who has ever outright <em>killed</em> a Celestial, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> of the Marvel Universe. And she did it with her regular powers—her boring, practical, <em>extremely lethal</em> powers.
<ul><li> Her powers can't even be flashy because most of the time they're invisible, meaning you can't even see the forcefields massacring her foes. <em>But that just means most enemies can't even see their quick and gory death coming.</em> As for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">Invisibility</a> powers, while they don't get as much work as her force fields, can be just as powerful and just as boring. She once tricked Dr. Doom into smashing into a mountain by turning the whole thing invisible. Flashy? No. Awesome? Possibly. Effective? Yes.

Of course, this gets him manhandled by a furious Eggman, who states if he wanted to just kill Sonic, he'd carpet-bomb him from his ship and be done with it; he wants to actually <em>defeat</em> him and prove his superiority first.

First, using a spell for banishing spiders to turn the entirety of the Arachnid Quarter into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a>. Second, while fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad">Four Horsemen</a>, Harry stops Mograine from using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ashbringer</a> by hitting him with a disarming spell then using a sticking spell to glue the sword to the floor.
<ul><li> Later he demonstrates how a silencing spell renders magic users helpless, easily taking out a large group of mages with an area silencing spells.
</li><li> Right from the start, one of Harry's most used spells is the translation spell which allows anyone under its effect to hear every language as their native language for twelve hours and any word they hear in another language, they'll be able to speak afterwards. An example given by a Tauren was that if she was hit by the spell then spent a day in Stormwind, she'd likely be completely fluent in Common by the time it wore off.
</li><li> Harry earns a lot of goodwill with both the Night Elves and the Horde leadership by introducing them to communication mirrors. Previously, communication between cities or outposts took weeks and changed hands so many times that the contents were frequently white-washed if not outright falsified. By giving Tyrande a hundred such mirrors, she and all her major outposts can communicate instantly with each other. While the Horde isn't initially given as many (due to Harry having no interaction with them yet), they still get a few dozen that allows all their leaders to contact each other at once. Furthermore, said mirrors have a conference call function so for example, all the Horde leaders can meet with each other without spending months preparing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HardBeingPure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HardBeingPure">Hard Being Pure</a></em>, during Rust's fight with Snatch, the latter complains that lasers are cheap and boring.

The fact said curse stores the pleasure that would be felt as a secondary energy source is also a useful bonus.

He also blesses the water tank for the school's fire suppression system so the sprinklers spray out holy water, making the school unassailable to vampires.

While it's not very much, it's enough for any shinobi who comes across some to grab it for a minor bonus, thus giving Naruto access to a much larger variety of venoms, toxins, and poisons than he otherwise would have.

Naruto manages to remove the "boring" part because of how ridiculously he overpowers them, such as turning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">henge</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a> and transforming into a cross between a hydra and a tentacle monster.

<ul><li> Quirrell asks the class how to defeat a troll. They come up with a number of complex scenarios to get around its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, most of them involving acid. Quirrell tells them that the correct answer is "hit it with the Killing Curse." That is <em>always</em> the correct answer.
<div class="indent"><strong>Quirrell</strong>: The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you find yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can simply Apparate away!
</div></li><li> Bear in mind that even if it's a very practical offensive spell, the Killing Curse is an "Unforgivable" (that is, "instant ticket to Azkaban for life, even if you're a minor and you were defending yourself") Curse, so the fact he's teaching kids to make this their "hammer" provides quite a hefty amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> about him. Furthermore, canonically, both the Killing Curse and Apparation are actually fairly difficult for even adult wizards, so they're not necessarily practical to begin with. They also don't help if you're in a situation where you can't kill your opponent (such as when you need to capture them alive) or can't escape (such as when you need to protect a location).
</li><li> Lucius Malfoy's lesson to his son Draco regarding plan-making is pretty much this: any plan that needs more than <em>two</em> steps to succeed is automatically hoping to get lucky on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastPlanStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastPlanStanding">Last Plan Standing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Roulette</a>, so it's best to make them very simple (to put in context: this lecture he gave as a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>" response to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> and Draco's apparent decision to take inspiration from it for his rivalry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass">with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Harry</a>). Quirrell eventually also provides a similar speech when he says that plans that are <em>absolutely</em> essential for the planner to succeed should not depend on anything that runs on chance (those that don't can be done as fancy as the planner wants, maybe even allowing them to fail for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>).

</li><li> Xander in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28404-163/DianeCastle%2BXendra.htm">Xendra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> makes a point while patrolling to wear durable clothes he can afford to lose, including either cheap tennis shoes or work boots. Contrast Buffy who wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpracticallyFancyOutfit">designer clothes and shoes and has a manicure while on patrol</a> then complains when they get damaged or stained.
<ul><li> Xander's carpentry skills frequently help out the Scoobies, and later Angel's group, by enabling him to cheaply and efficiently repair any damage incurred against their homes. While he lacks Buffy's and Faith's fighting ability or Willow's magic and brains, Xander makes sure they don't go bankrupt repairing the Hyperion after the battle against Skip trashes the place.

While the curse can't be magically blocked, it can only kill a single target, regardless of said target's size.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Transcendence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Transcendence">Transcendence</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Zangetsu</a> is seen as this at a glance in-universe since the blade is remarkably plain looking by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">Azeroth</a> standards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Worldfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Worldfall">Worldfall</a></em> has a few examples:

A new 140mm gun, thicker armor, and an autoloader to fire faster. Race tank crews find the latter the most devastating.
</li><li> The post-Footfall Race offensive suffers three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">massive defeats</a>, but if the Americans, the Mexicans and the Canadians used massive amounts of air bombardment (even using <em>every single strategic bomber in tactical roles</em>) and artillery at Route 55 and the French wiped out the Race offensive on Lyon with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">nerve gas</a></span>, the Italians decimated the invasion of Sicily by simply taking advantage of the hill/mountain terrain mix their army is uniquely adapted to.

</li><li> During the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">chunin exam arc</a> of the fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SugarPlums" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SugarPlums">Sugar Plums</a></em>, there is a chapter devoted to showing some of the genin's fighting styles. When it gets to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsert">Ume</a>, she notes the opponent she's fighting doesn't seem to have any clear signs of being from a powerful konoha clan. So instead of doing anything flashy, she closes the distance then one by one breaks the genin's wrists before yelling to the exam proctor to call it since her opponent could no longer throw weapons, punches or use hand signs. This style of very nonflashy but efficient ways of standard combat is something that becomes a hallmark of Ume's overall fighting style which focuses mostly on very fast movements and standard ninja tools rather than large scale or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">complicated jutsu</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Sirius Black</a> in the snippet <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8510543/24/Alternate-Beginnings-of-an-Uzumaki">Magical Contracts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> completely changes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Shinobi world</a> via the titular items. While not remotely flashy, the idea of contracts that are impossible to break (at least not without dire consequences) reshape the world as not only are agreements between two parties actually ironclad, but no one is willing to make an agreement without a magical contract.
</li><li> This is practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry, Ron, and Hermione's</a> motto in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum">Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. Any plan that gets them out of a situation alive and well is always the go-to plan. For example, when scouting the Chamber of Secrets to see if there's another Basilisk, Luna asks if they're going to fight it if there is one. The trio reply that if there is indeed a second Basilisk, then they're going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">flee and report the Basilisk to Dumbledore</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0140t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0140t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0140t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They didn't inform Dumbledore about the investigation because they didn't want to waste his time in case the hypothetical second basilisk didn't exist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">something he calmly calls them out on</a></span>.
<div class="indent">"I thought we were hunting the basilisk." Luna commented. <br/>"No, we're investigating," Harry managed through his constricted throat. "If we actually think there's a giant murder snake here, we are all going to move quickly back to the hole and get out." <br/>"That's no fun." <br/>"Nope," Ron agreed. "It's nice and boring." <br/>"And safe." Harry added.

Such tactics allow his men to rather easily defeat a force five times their size due to the latter's lack of discipline. He also teaches what he knows of sanitation and modern medicine (such as digging latrines downhill from the camp to cut down on sickness).
</li><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206/chapters/29827086">Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Ron Weasley competes in a magical cooking competition and due to a poor showing in the previous challenge, has to make a breakfast dish with only two ingredients, one of which has to be eggs. In the end, he makes three different variations of bacon and eggs with the only criticism he receives being that his dish was rather bland because he wasn't allowed to use anything else.
</li><li> Jaune in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12854072/8/The-ProfessionARC">The ProfessionARC<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> makes a point of color coding his elixirs by their strength as well as putting them in differently shaped containers. As a result, he can always tell what an elixir is with a glance or a feel if he can't look at it. Jaune also admits that the ones that see the most use aren't ones that enhance his senses or combat ability but ones that speed up his healing.
</li><li> When being offered weapons during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a>,</em> Carol, who doesn't have much combat experience at this point, rejects something like a sword or an axe (which she doesn't know how to use) in favour of a simple, kite-shaped shield. It's not as deadly as, say, Uhtred's axe, but it does come in <em>very</em> useful during the ensuing fight.
<ul><li> Natasha, Steve's, and Clint's abilities as spotters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">The Strategist</a> are well-harnessed by the Avengers. While Thor and Loki are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">Combo Platter Powers</a>, Tony has his armors, and the Hulk has the raw physical power to crush almost any other opponent, Steve's abilities as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">The Strategist</a> are used to figure out where and how to best utilize them, while one or both of Clint and Natasha will go high and keep an eye on the battlefield to direct their allies.
</li><li> The Winter Soldier's lethal nature and rep for taking down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">high-level targets</a> is shown to be heavily related to this - not his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> abilities, not his metal arm, nor close up assaults. This is not to say that he isn't good at all of these; in fact, he's downright deadly, capable of matching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> a.k.a. The Best There Is At What He Does, in a <em>knife fight</em>, while carrying broken ribs. However, he's realistic about his limits and most of the time, he will simply either set up a bomb, or use his abilities as a sniper in conjunction with the best ammunition he can get hold of. By doing so, he has so far managed to kill a previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Captain Britain</a>, almost Thor, and severely piss off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dracula</span> - the latter a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> level being in his own right.
</li><li> While comparing wandless and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">wanded magic</a>, Harry Dresden states that the latter falls into this trope. While wandless magic has all kinds of great perks, like greater longevity and magical senses, and is incredibly flexible (every practicioner has their own strengths and can do all kinds of things with their area of expertise), it also takes longer to learn, partially because that same flexibility also makes it harder to standardize. Meanwhile, a wanded mage can become incredibly proficient in just a decade or two of study, and its standardization means that a wizard doesn't have to make things up, say, in the middle of a fight.

While Rhodes guesses it was sending the nuke bound for New York through the Chitauri portal, Tony corrects him that it was inventing mosquito repelling fabric. Because of the clothes, screens, and nets made from that fabric (the last of which Tony donates in mass to charities), mosquito born diseases have almost been eradicated.

While Steve and Natasha come up with a risky plan to use their flash drive without being caught by HYDRA, Tony just disables the wifi in a room and uses a computer that's physically disconnected from any networks. The program can't send out an alert if there's no network to send it through.

Case in point, Izuku's Emerald Gust is a set of armored gloves and boots that protect his hands and feet while bolstering his attacks with shotgun blasts. However, they don't have the bells and whistles and multiple transformations of weapons like Ruby's Crescent Rose and Weiss' Myrtenaster.

But in a world where no one has hands, basic telekinesis is pretty useful.

</li><li> Littlepip's cutie mark is a PipBuck, omnipresent in the Stable. She got a job as a PipBuck repair pony. She's rather embarrassed that her special talent is nothing but doing minor repair work. However, she eventually realizes her talent is something else altogether. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her cutie mark doesn't represent that she's good with PipBucks (though she is), but that she's good at the thing PipBucks were originally designed for: <em>Finding people</em>.

Practice: upon receiving the Fox Miraculous she spends a whole night casting illusions (it helps her favorite snack is what Trixx uses to fuel his powers and that she already knows how to play the <em>dizi</em>), and later starts taking MMA classes, something that has the added benefit of helping her with her anger management issues by allowing her to vent on something.

<ul><li> "Used to it" is a bit of an understatement, even for Cain.

The reason being that any store that sells hunting weapons will probably have at least one available (or you could purchase one with ease), ammunition is plenty, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> is useless against zombies if the only way to kill them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovingTheHeadOrDestroyingTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovingTheHeadOrDestroyingTheBrain">Removing the Head or Destroying the Brain</a> (simply said, accuracy is a <em>must</em>), plus the action is much more reliable in long-term use than a full-auto or semi-auto gun. Coming a close second due to less accessibility is a semi-automatic rifle fitted with a suppressor.
</li><li> As far as melee weapons are concerned, the book highly recommends survivors pass up exotic blades in favour of the humble crowbar, for its reach, balance and utility: can you pry open a door or tear down a barricade with that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">fancy katana</a>?
</li><li> Heavy cruiser/touring motorcycles may not be the coolest option depending on your view, but their advantages over cars are considerable: they're far easier to repair, much more maneuverable, can carry a few hundred pounds of supplies (plus more if you have a sidecar), and have reasonable performance on dirt roads or damaged urban roads. Plus they can be easily pushed somewhere safe to be repaired, while cars leave you out in the open. Bicycles are also an excellent choice, being even easier to keep working as well as quiet and versatile.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmourIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmourIsUseless">Armour Is Useless</a>, being either too cumbersome to wear for more than a few hours or something that will seal in your sweat. The book recommends you settle for tight (but comfortable) clothing with a few pockets, running shoes, and short length hair. This won't tire you out and still prevent zombies from grabbing you easily as there's nothing to really grip.
</li><li> In the book, one attack at a dockyard was foiled by the crane operators using the cargo containers as barricades and simply dropping them on the zombies to crush them.
</li></ul></li><li> The French novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malevil">Malevil</a></em> features the eponymous castle. Built by the invading English during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a> it was built solely for function and has little aesthetic value unlike its opposing neighbor, the French castle Les Rouzies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a></em> uses this trope to lampshade the trope where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> which are swords are most often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon">shiny</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">cool looking</a> (as described: shiny that lights up with a ting!) At the end of the book in which Carrot joins the Watch, Fred Colon thinks that perhaps the sword of the last king of Ankh-Morpork isn't shiny and lights up with a "ting!" Perhaps the sword of the king is a boring old sword that was simply very, very, very sharp. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Carrot has such a sword.</span>
<ul><li> The sword in question is something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted Trope</a>. It is so remarkably unmagical it doesn't even have the trace of background magic almost everything on the Disc is saturated with, thus making it slightly more real than everything else it encoutners.
</li></ul></li><li> In the same vein, Cohen and the Silver Horde (a group of octogenarian barbarian heroes) carry notably notched and beat-up swords that are STILL sharp enough to cut a die in half in mid-air.
<ul><li> At one point, Cohen internally reflects that a simple, plain non-magical sword in the hands of a truly brave man will cut through a magical sword like suet. He's reflecting on this fact while looking at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Carrot's sword</span>, which has been previously described as one of the most non-magical objects on the Disc.
</li></ul></li><li> Discworld witches in general tend to be this, especially compared to wizards. Witchcraft is more about the direct application of psychology and common sense than magic. When the Lancre Witches face off against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">Lady Felmet</a>, Granny tries to defeat her by reaching into her mind and breaking down the mental barriers that keep her from seeing her true self, revealing to her what a sadistic monster she is. When this doesn't work, Nanny Ogg just hits her on the head with a cauldron.
</li><li> Discworld dwarfs have a virtually religious attachment to their axes, usually owning or carrying a few different types. However, the traditional "Dwarf axe" shape is an utterly practical one. It has a pickaxe on one side, for digging up interesting minerals, and a regular axeblade on the other, for dealing with unreasonable people who want to take your interesting minerals. A dwarf with a proper dwarf axe can both dig interesting minerals and cut firewood. A dwarf with minerals and fire can make a forge and tools, and a dwarf with a forge and tools can make <em>anything</em>.
</li><li> Though wizards can be practical when the need arises. As Mustrum Ridcully has pointed out, if the magic stored in a wizard's staff doesn't work, "a good poke in any available soft bits" with a six-foot stick-with-a-knob-on-the-end can still be a very effective deterrent.
</li><li> Although Moist von Lipwig is a theatrical conman with a flair for the dramatic, when he's put in charge of revitalizing Ankh-Morpork's decrepit postal system, his main selling point amounts to this. The post may not be as modern, flashy, and fast as the recently invented "Clacks" semaphore system, but it's also more reliable, less expensive, and sending a whole book isn't much harder than sending a letter.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> the "Eebs" work like this. When trying to kill an extremely powerful wizard they shoot at him with a silenced pistol from inside a car. When it fails they just drive away. They hire a local killer to attack him. They chuck a firebomb into his building while he sleeps. All things that don't take a scrap of supernatural power to achieve. They are also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Red Court's</a> two most successful assassins. The reasons being that while these individual attempts don't have a particularly high success rate, they also expose them to barely any risk and take little effort, and sooner or later they get lucky.
<ul><li> Grevane makes zombies. Not a particularly spectacular power, compared to insanely powerful and insanely versatile sorcerer Cowl or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">body-surfer</a> Corpsetaker, but it is hard to argue with a man who can raise and control undead in high three-digit numbers. It helps that Dresdenverse zombies are more like meaty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">T-800s</a> than the usual shamblers.
</li><li> Similar to Grevane is Binder. Binder is a one-trick pony, and his trick is creating servitors known as the Grey Men. Again, compared to Harry's fireballs, it's less than impressive, but the Grey Men are fast, strong, intelligent enough to use simple machines (like guns) and, unlike Grevane's zombies, can operate semi-independently.
</li><li> Harry's .44 Magnum revolver. It's not as sophisticated as the FN P-90 that Murphy favors during combat, nor it has any badass enchantments like the swords of the Knights Of The Cross (or Harry's other magical apparel), but what it <em>is</em> is a highly reliable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a> that has saved Harry often both because of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">stopping power</a> and because it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation">highly intimidating</a>. For that matter, when an enemy does get to close range, Harry's been known to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuWizard">just bonk them over the head with his staff (which, after all, is a six-foot-long length of solid oak) or punch them in the face</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Slugthrower" weaponry — these are firearms, guns that fire bullets. This is a 'verse where blasters are fairly easy to come by. But Luke Skywalker trained with slugthrowers as a kid on Tatooine, and a character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shatterpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shatterpoint">Shatterpoint</a></em> has this to say about them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tenk</strong>: Slugthrowers. I hate 'em. But they're easy to maintain. Day or two in the jungle and your blaster'll never fire again. A good slug rifle, keep 'em wiped and oiled, they last forever. The guerrillas have pretty good luck with them, even though they take a <em>lot</em> of practice — slugs are ballistic, y'know? You have to plot the trajectory in your head.
</div></li><li> That and they're the perfect Jedi-killing weapon: a blaster bolt can be easily deflected back with a lightsaber, but if a Jedi intercepts a slugthrower round it will only melt it without deflecting or slowing it, resulting in the defending Jedi getting hit with a less lethal but much more painful slug. And making him defenseless due the pain, if the bullet didn't kill him outright. Even if the lightsaber does deflect the slug, the Jedi can't reflect it back at an opponent the way they could a blaster bolt. The Force is effective against them, but it takes a skilled Jedi to catch a bullet with it.
<ul><li> There is one noted weakness: Stormtrooper armor actually works against them. Which is why most guerrillas that use them against Stormtroopers have to do stuff like filling the rounds with explosives. Even then, it's also mentioned that one advantage slugthrowers have over blasters is that you <em>can</em> silence slugthrowers.
</li></ul></li><li> The YT-1300 Corellian Light Freighter when compared to an X-Wing or Star Destroyer is one of the most boring ships in the universe. It is, however, one of the most popular. Reliable, durable, easy to modify and repair in an emergency; the YT-1300 is a favorite of smugglers throughout the galaxy. The most famous example, of course, is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Millennium Falcon</a></em> as it is the best example of what a resourceful spacer can do with the design.
</li><li> The X-Wing also falls into this in the Expanded Universe, where, before the production of the XJ and StealthX series, it was outmatched entirely by next generation fighters like its distant cousin the E-Wing and the Empire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">pure hotrod of a starship</a>, the TIE Defender. Yet even all the way to the Yuuzhan Vong War, the X-Wing remained perhaps <em>the</em> most effective fighter in the Rebel Alliance/New Republic/Galactic Alliance's arsenal, thanks to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">near perfectly balanced performance and capabilities</a>, as well as the ease at which pilots (namely Rogue Squadron) can use them. Sure, a few good pilots in TIE Defenders are a considerable threat, but an X-Wing with Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, Tycho Celchu or Corran Horn at the controls is guaranteed to be the superior force (no pun intended). Part of that for the X-wing is that the cockpit and controls are intentionally designed to resemble those of cheap, popular civilian aircraft. This makes them seem mundane ("boring") but also makes it much easier and faster for civilian pilots to transition to X-wings ("practical").
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFightingStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFightingStyle">lightsaber style</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Soresu</a>. It's the most widespread and defensive form of Jedi combat, and it's nowhere near as flashy as other styles like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatParkour">Ataru</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Vaapad</a>. It's also why Obi-Wan Kenobi was able to beat General Grievous, despite the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">wielding four lightsabers</a>, as it made for an impregnable defense. He managed to defeat Darth Vader and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Darth Maul</span>, by using this very style.
</li><li> Darth Bane notes in his part of <em>Book of the Sith</em> that this style and Form V (Shien/Djem So, the attacking style), are the best useful fighting styles for the Sith.
</li><li> Regarding the otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Death Star</a> — in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em>, Governor Tarkin sends Director Krennic a message warning him not to get so carried away with making the Death Star a technological marvel that he loses sight of its true purpose as a weapon to silence dissent against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>. In short, a "crude but functional" Death Star is acceptable. Krennic, however, begs to differ. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">We all know how that turns out</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a short story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> called <em>Superiority</em> about a space empire that keeps inventing one incredible super weapon after another, with the most cutting edge science. They end up getting overrun by their enemies who directed their resources towards making huge numbers of basic ships with 'generic' weapons while the other side was busy updating their ships, and by exploiting the flaws and weaknesses of waves of new technology being field-tested for the first time.
</li><li> A similar short story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, "The Machine That Won The War", showcases the "garbage in, garbage out" problem by mentioning that every single person in the chain of providing tactical information to the titular supercomputer, from the front-line generals down to the keyboard operator, <em>all</em> embellished the information for the sake of looking good or because the other information looked <em>too</em> good. So the person who took a look at the predictions of the super-computer and made the plans for the military used the <em>actual</em> titular machine to assist him... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he flipped a coin</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>'s book "The Status Civilization" has the main character running an antidote shop on a lawless planet. He is amazed at how, despite all the scientific advancement, most poisoners prefer the plain old arsenic and strychnine. The main problem in his job, in fact, turned out to be convincing his clients that their wives would use something so primitive.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries">Belisarius Series</a>, both the Romans and the Malwa have advisers from the future, but while the Malwa adviser Link tends to think in terms of flashy, futuristic weaponry, the Roman adviser Aide tends towards this trope. While Aide does help the Romans make gunpowder weapons, he also gives them boring but practical advances with things like stirrups: easy to make, simple to use, and instantly makes your cavalry far more effective.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a> series has the ships produced by the Puppetteers: 4 models (3 available to civilians) which are customizable only in the paint job you want on them, but account for 95% of starship sales in Known Space because they are completely indestructible and impervious to radiation and weaponry. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But not antimatter or tides, as several characters learn the hard way.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Expelliarmus</em>, the Disarming Charm. Simple, plain, does no damage. Easy to cast. But since most wizards are useless in combat without their wands, very useful. (And there's the added bonus that an <em>expelliarmus</em>-ed wand will sometimes change allegiance to the wizard responsible.) It knocks whatever someone's holding out of their grip, too, not just wands. In <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, Lupin warns Harry not to make it his signature move, despite how useful it is. In practice, it turns out to be incredibly useful: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Draco effectively defeats Dumbledore with it</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry uses it twice to counter Voldemort's Avada Kedavra, killing Voldemort for good</span>.
</li><li> While we're at it, <em>Stupefy</em>. It is a spell that knocks someone out. That is all. But unless you want a person dead (and there are plenty of situations where you wouldn't, even if you have no qualms about killing, and even if your goal was to kill you could use <em>Stupefy</em> and deliver the killing blow muggle style, while the Killing Curse is one of the most difficult spells to cast), it's just as effective at putting an opponent out of a fight (It also helps that using <em>Stupefy</em> won't earn its user a life sentence in Azkaban, like the Killing Curse will). There's also the simple fact that <em>Stupefy</em> is both simpler and <em>faster</em> to say — you could have it cast by the time your opponent is halfway through <em>Avada Kedavra</em>. Assuming of course you can't use silent casting, something that works for <em>Stupefy</em> and not for the Killing Curse (unless the wizard is very, very powerful). Of course, if Stupefy is overpowered or multiple wizards cast it at one person, you risk harming or killing your target (Mcgonnagle was hospitalized after being struck by four simultaneous Stunners in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, as an example of the latter.)
</li><li> Furthermore, the Confundus Charm, as used by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Snape</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>,</em> amongst others. It's not as powerful of a mind-control spell as the Imperius Curse, but a clever user can still cause havoc by giving the Confunded person the right instructions, with the added bonus that it's not illegal like the Imperius or Killing Curses. (Un)fortunately, however, most wizards operate on very little logic, something that is lampshaded by Hermione.
</li><li> Of the three Deathly Hallows, Harry's Invisibility Cloak is one of these. Turning yourself invisibile is not as impressive as having the most powerful wand in the world or a stone that could summon the dead (and quite possibly command an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Inferi</a>), but simply hiding from your enemies and walking past them does so many wonders for Harry and his friends.
</li><li> This trope is a big reason the Killing Curse is so reviled in-story. Lots of spells will kill the target, or even a lot of people at once, often in very flashy ways. The Killing Curse kills one person, very deliberately, with no ceremony, fancy effects, or hope of recovery. It's murder, pure and simple.
</li></ul></li><li> This is basically the Forsaken Mesaana's whole shtick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>. She may not be as smart as Ishamael, as powerful as Lanfear, as great a warrior as Demandred, or as feared as Semirhage, but she's a solidly intelligent, methodical planner who is driven primarily by a pathological need to prove her own competence. She also lacks many of the extreme mental issues that her comrades exhibit, and is neither a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> enough to throw herself into fights willy-nilly. Her careful, goal-oriented approach lets her through careful action paralyze the most powerful institution on the planet for most of the series, and she manages to survive all the way to the penultimate book. She <em>is</em>, however, fully aware that she falls under the boring side of things and has a chip on her shoulder about it (again, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> is basically feeling that no one ever recognized or appreciated her true talents) so Egwene is able to exploit it to draw her into a direct confrontation <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and destroy her mind in a battle of wills</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicians">The Magicians</a></em> magicians and gods have access to an immense range of weird abilities. The most powerful beings however, have a tendency to just physically attack with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and shrug off any complicated magic thrown at them.
</li><li> This comes up with several characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series, like Admiral Khumalo and to a lesser extent Admiral Caparelli. While they lack the sheer genius of many other characters in the series, they make up for it by being hard-working, determined and good at delegation and are in fact acknowledged to be better at their assigned tasks (commanding officer of the Talbott Sector and senior uniformed officer of the entire Royal Manticoran Navy, respectively) than their more inspired and "flashy" colleagues would have been.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDayOfTheJackal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDayOfTheJackal">The Day of the Jackal</a></em>, the tactics used by Lebel and the French police to find the titular master assassin are pretty much brute-force and absurd thoroughness (Lebel's bugging of <em>all the phones</em> of the French government high-ups in his search of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, the obtaining of all the guest records of all the hotels in France and looking through all of the birth and death certificates for The Jackal's aliases). In an era where all the records were paper and had to be looked through by hand, these searches were very slow-yet nevertheless the police is able to find proof of the Jackal's activities and forces him to keep moving and changing identities. The way with which he finds the Jackal's sniping spot at the end is also very much this: instead of a complicated criminal profiling mind-game, he just asks every guard on the perimeter of the event if they saw someone that looked like the Jackal, until he finds one that did.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook</a> <em>Duel of the Masters</em> both you and the book's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> are monks skilled in the martial arts. In at least one ending you realize he's used to fighting less skilled opponents and using flashy, impressive moves to cement his reputation as someone not to be messed with. Once you realize this you quickly start fighting back with moves that don't look cool, but, well, you win.

When they launch an attack on Copenhagen, the Danes simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> the ships with a fleet of longboats armed with spar torpedoes. The casualty rate among the Danes is appalling, but their boats and bombs are easy and cheap to produce in large numbers. They don't win the battle, but they manage to mission kill one ironclad, and pose a genuine threat to the rest.

Grantville is a small mining town that lacks the precision tools needed to make 20th century firearms, but 19th century guns are basically the same tech the 17th century Downtimers are using but slightly improved for power and accuracy (which also means their allies don't have to adjust their training regimens to compensate for unfamiliar weapons). Ammunition is easy to come by as it's the same as the older guns, and restocking after a battle isn't too much of an issue as the victors can loot their foe's supplies. Finally, in the inevitability that some of the guns fall into the hands of Grantville's geopolitical enemies like the French or Spanish and get reversed engineered, the resulting leap won't tip the balance of power too far against them (as they still have a decent cache of modern weapons, and the know-how to make more ammo for them).

He has <em>deep</em> madra reserves due to his advanced cycling technique (which he teaches to Lindon), so he basically always has more power to use. As he says, there are other cycling techniques that improve recovery time and so on, but why worry about all that when you have so much power that you'll never run out? Underlords such as Eithan can also turn madra into soulfire (though there are more efficient methods of creating soulfire), so he also has deep soulfire reserves. Most underlords are miserly with their soulfire, but Eithan burns it casually because he is confident he can always make more.

Then he looks at the back of the TV and is shocked to see that it's not waterproofed in any way. He muses that the moisture will kill the TV in a few years, so they will have to buy another. Then he realizes that this is the point. Why waste tons of money on a waterproof TV, when they can simply buy another at a fraction of the price every 4 years or so, especially since technology will have changed by then, so the new TV will be better? He admits it makes sense. It's just that the post-Soviet people have not yet learned to be as wasteful as other capitalist countries.

</li><li> The typical armored hack-and-slash fighting style of Westerosi knights like Jorah Mormont can be described this way in comparison to some of the more elegant fighting styles from Essos. It may not be as energetic as the Dothraki, as precise as the Unsullied, or as graceful as the Braavosi Water Dance, but it is just as effective. It shows in Jorah's fight with Qotho, and is best seen when Jorah, Grey Worm, and Daario fight off Yunkish guards in "The Rains of Castamere". Daario and Grey Worm are far more graceful in their movements, but Jorah is just as effective.
</li><li> Roose's strategy to remain behind Winterfell's high walls and let Stannis' forces waste away from cold and deprivation. To inject some action into the narrative, Ramsay prefers to take the fight to Stannis with twenty picked men, though this itself is a very good example of the trope — only twenty men were risked, and Stannis' already in-trouble army was even more severely crippled, losing most of their horses and food, making the eventual battle even easier than it was before.

Jack O'Neill pulls out two grenades, pulls the pins, and casually drops them down the shaft so they can blow up the generators. "Primitive explosive devices" are quite effective, if you know how to use them.

Except that Jack's flashy sonic blaster has a very quickly drained battery which, since the factory that produced both blaster and batteries has now been blown up (and replaced with a banana grove), renders it a flashy paperweight when the battery runs out, while the sonic screwdriver is frequently shown to be useful and reliable.
<ul><li> Subverted with Jack's vortex manipulator, which is the size of a wristwatch and can be used for time travel, sometimes to places where even the Doctor's TARDIS can't go. It also doubles as a teleporter, a chemical scanner, a remote control (that can hack most electronic objects), a hologram projector, a lifesign detector, and a communications transceiver.

</li><li> Panic Attack was basically a small yellow box with ineffective lifting forks. In Season 2, through pushing power and Kim Davies' driving skill, it beat all the other competitors and won the championship.

This allocation also tends to give weaponless robots the edge in speed and maneuverability, rendering many weapons useless against them as they can drive circles around their competitors. For instance, by ComBots V's semifinals, Last Rites was the only remaining robot that had a weapon, and even then, its operator also registered The Great Pumpkin, a weaponless robot, into the competition, which did almost as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>
<ul><li> The <em>Excelsior</em>-class starship. First introduced in Kirk's era, eighty years later they still serve as the backbone of Starfleet. They might not be as flashy as the later <em>Defiants</em> or <em>Akiras</em>, but a refitted <em>Excelsior</em> can hold its own against them. It's even lampshaded in episode of <em>TNG</em> that, while the <em>Enterprise</em> might get the more glamorous deep space assignments, the <em>Excelsiors</em> remain the vital workhorses of the fleet.
</li><li> Before the <em>Excelsior</em>-class (specifically back when the <em>Excelsior</em> herself was the new kid on the block), we have the <em>Constitution</em>-class starship as Starfleet's original workhorse (similar to the modern day <em>Arleigh Burke</em>-class destroyer, the Federation had these things by the dozen). This is best exemplified by the original <em>Enterprise</em>: unlike her immediate predecessor, her numerous descendants or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">alternate incarnation</a> (all of which were among the most advanced ships of Starfleet), the first <em>Enterprise</em> was more or less a standard ship of the fleet, yet, through a combination of her capabilities and her crew's skill and perseverance, became one of the most celebrated and legendary starships within the Federation.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Pinballs </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> games can invoke this if there's a shot that is not too difficult to repeat and yields a substantial number of points — the player can (try to) spam the shot and build up their score. This trope tends to come up most often in competitions where maximizing your score on each table is the main purpose, but doesn't happen as often in solo or friendly play due to its boring nature, where as long as you made the replay, you can just try again for free next game if you don't get your high score. Well designed tournament pinball machines will reward riskier and more difficult strategies with more points, allowing someone going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> to get ahead with enough skill, which is always entertaining.
</li><li> The center ramp in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PoliceForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PoliceForce">Police Force</a></em> can be lit for Unlimited Millions, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">gives a million points for each shot.</a> Since the ramp is easily accessible in the middle of the playfield from either flipper, it's prone to this trope. You light unlimited millions by shooting the ramp repeatedly. Any shot not a ramp risks a drain even if you hit it, and this one provides a consistent feed to let you repeat it from the right flipper. This makes it practical, and nearly always the shot you want to shoot. Very boring, but it's the fastest and safest way to get points on the table.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>,</em> the Chase Loop (the upper-right counterclockwise lane) can be built up so it rewards 5 million points per shot after just five times. Completing the orbit returns the ball to the left flipper for another shot, and doing so fast enough also rewards a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combo">Combo</a> bonus that <em>increases</em> by 1 million points for every successful loop. Unsurprisingly, competitive players will frequently try to spam this for hundreds of millions of points in a few minutes.
</li><li> In general, trapping a ball on a raised flipper. Nothing is moving—which, while the least interesting thing to look at if you're spectating, slows the pace of the game down to a manageable level, gives the player time to plan out his or her next moves, and, because the ball will always roll down in the same way once the flipper lowers, improves aim.
</li><li> Ramps in general are this. They will nearly always feed the ball to a flipper safely at a slow speed when you hit them, keeping the ball under control so you can shoot another shot afterwards without needing to nudge, possibly another ramp, or even the same ramp (like in Police Force). Not all ramps are like this, but the vast majority of them are.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Professional Wrestling </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Whenever a wrestler uses a basic move (like a suplex or a body slam) as a finisher, it's this. Mainly because the move itself is something that, if legitimately done with intent to harm rather than pulled for appearances the way it is in pro wrestling, chances are the victim (and perhaps even the perpetrator) wouldn't soon get back up. The legends of the '80s and early '90s <em>excelled</em> at making such moves look like the former while actually being the latter, to the point where even in the 21st century where wrestlers are employing much flashier versions of said moves as routine mid-match transitional spots, the back-to-basics versions performed by the legends are instantly recognized as match-enders or KO spots.
<ul><li> The best examples through history are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>, who used a leg drop and a body splash respectively. Their muscular frames and ability to convincingly project an aura of superhuman adrenaline meant that if you were flat on your back and Hogan dropped his right leg on your neck or Warrior's chest crashed down into yours, you weren't getting up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">Matt Jackson</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a> dropping the same leg, even while flipping forward 270 degrees, doesn't quite have the same sense of gravity to it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>'s Scorpion Death Drop is a great example. The move is just an Inverted DDT, which doesn't stand out in a world full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">Attitude Adjustments</a> and 450 Splashes. But if someone were to legitimately do that to an opponent on something harder than a wrestling mat, chances are they're not getting up from it. And when Sting holds you in place for it, he builds the anticipation for the move while making it look like he's setting himself up to drop you as hard as he can, before falling backwards and dragging you down in cascading fashion. This is how he was able to consistently use it as a believable finisher even in TNA, when in the same company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> was doing it with the added momentum of a springboard somersault and would rarely if ever get a three-count off it.
</li><li> Speaking of a DDT, the original by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake Roberts</a> is another perfect example. Anyone getting intentionally dropped, dragged, or thrown headfirst into a hard surface floor is probably coming away with a concussion <strong>AT BEST</strong>. Jake pulls off the move with a psychological authority that projects a realistic intent to incapacitate and makes it look, in the moment, like a pure knockout drop, in a way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> spinning around an opponent or wrenching their arm and kicking them in the gut to set them up, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustinRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustinRhodes">Dustin Rhodes</a> catching an opponent while running off the ropes, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> holding an opponent while swinging off the second rope, simply <em>can't</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Exiting the cage in a steel cage match via the door. You COULD go over the top of the cage to leave but the official standing near the door is compelled to open it when a competitor tells him to. This is usually a good way to get heel heat since it's taking the "easy way" out. However, it's very often subverted because, despite the practicality and effectiveness of leaving via the cage door, no one ever seems to get to it in time before the opponent is back on their feet and dragging them away from it. When cage matches end by escape, it's almost always via going over the top. In fact, the few times someone does win by escaping through the door, it's almost always beating an opponent who attempted to escape over the top.
</li><li> Tripping your opponent via Drop Toehold, Dropkick to the knee, etc. Not as impressive as a Clothesline, Spear, etc.; nor as flashy as a Hurricanrana, Missile Dropkick, etc.; but much harder, if not impossible, to avoid. This especially comes in handy against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGiant">The Giant</a>-types.
</li><li> Strike finishers. The WWE began handing them out like candy in the mid-to-late 2010s and while they're often quite simple and not very flashy (especially if one is into more grapple-based finishers), they make a loud enough noise that fans can react to it, requires a fairly simple bump to be taken by the performers (sometimes just doing a simple prat fall), and can be pulled from out of nowhere for shock value. As an added bonus, it reduces the amount of stress either performer takes, which is important in the Fed due to its exhausting touring and TV schedule.
</li><li> The first, most useful, and most ubiquitous move that is trained into new wrestling prospects isn't a punch or a kick, but the flat back bump. What's an RKO? A flat back bump. Taking a Rock Bottom or Chokeslam? Jump up, flat back bump. Taking a clothesline or superkick? Run into your opponent's limb and flat back bump. Receiving a suplex? Do a beel (or biel) bump, jump into a front flip and do a flat back bump while your opponent holds you. Sunset flips, senton bombs, DDTs, dropkicks, powerslams, suplexes, powerbombs, all involve variations of the flat back bump or beel bump, and once you know what to look for, you'll see them all over the place.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> has a strategy known as "Pagonging" (named after the Pagong tribe, who fell victim to it all the way back in the first season). Initially, the survivors are split into two teams of equal number. Partway through the game, after several survivors have been eliminated, the two teams merge and it becomes every man for himself — but the players hold on to the "us vs. them" mentality of the previous teams, and if all goes well, the larger team will stay together and eliminate the smaller team one by one, only turning on each other when they've run out of targets or the last member of that other tribe has won immunity. It's very efficient for those members of the larger team, but predictable and not nearly as fun for the home audience to watch as a chaotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a>.
<ul><li> Then there's the strategy of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>. Unless pretending to be stupid involves doing something that's funny, you won't get much screentime by staying out of harm's way. That being said, if you can convince the players in control that you're not a threat at all (e.g. Natalie White, who played this to perfection), they'll take you to the end under the assumption that you're no trouble to beat.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen">Hell's Kitchen</a></em> season 3, one of the top performers was Julia, a Waffle House line cook from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. The professionally-trained chefs (especially those on her own team) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">tended to treat her like crap and denigrate her skills</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3k3nc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3k3nc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3k3nc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or as one of the teammates noted, "She works in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fuckin'</a> Waffle House, I mean <em>come on</em></span>, but it turned out she had precisely the skill set Gordon Ramsay was looking for — good teamwork, promptness with her cooking, and staying cool under pressure. So much so that when she was eliminated near the end, Gordon praised her potential and dedication, and then paid for her to go to culinary school.
<ul><li> In particular, one episode had a breakfast challenge; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">instead of asking the woman who does this every day of her life for help</a>, the other women told her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetMeCoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetMeCoffee">"go peel potatoes"</a>. When Gordon noticed, he ordered the women to let Julia cook; she quickly turned the sinking ship into an overwhelming victory.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoodNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoodNetwork">Food Network</a>'s Celebrity Chef Cook-Off had as its Elimination Challenge... grilled cheese. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong">Cheech Marin</a> and Lou Diamond Philips made fancy sandwiches with unusual breads and extra bits thrown in, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSync" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSync">Joey Fatone</a> made a basic grilled cheese sandwich decorated only with a smiley face made of sliced tomatoes and a pickle. However, Cheech's sandwich was greasy and LDP didn't melt the cheese, while Joey (who said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">he makes grilled cheese all the time for his kids</a>) ended up winning immunity because his no-frills sandwich was perfectly made.
</li><li> Similarly, in US Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef">MasterChef</a></em>, one episode's Mystery Box challenge gave the contestants a bunch of unlabeled foreign ingredients. Some chefs panicked, some chefs experimented, but Eddie won the challenge by just grilling the meat, mashing the yam, and sauteeing the greens. The judges unanimously agreed that it was a very plain dish, but prepared perfectly.
</li><li> Plenty of episodes in both the UK and US versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a></em> had chefs making extremely flashy food that was especially difficult or time-consuming to cook, or had managers decorate their restaurants with flashy but gaudy styles and using tacky gimmicks to draw in customers. Gordon has them change to fit this trope. Some of the best examples of the former and the later respectively are Rococo's and The Curry Lounge.
</li><li> Go onto almost any message board for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel">America's Next Top Model</a></em>. You'll probably find no shortage of support for Nigel Barker or Jay Manuel (Mister Jay) while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a> Tyra hardly gets any. Part of that came from their dry delivery, which is almost always in plain simple English rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Tyraspeak</a> she is ever so fond of. Hell, even with his silly accent imitations, the flamboyant J. Alexander (Miss Jay, also a fan favorite) can get his point across with next to no mumbo-jumbo. There is a reason many fans did not like the news that they all left (though Miss Jay did return).
<ul><li> Love him or hate him, Rob Evans was an excellent example of this trope. He might not have had the giant personality that fans of Miss Jay love, but as a working model, he knew how the game worked and made no attempt to lie about it to anyone.
</li></ul></li><li> In the American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em>, there's similar strategies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>. However in this game, it's free-for-all from the very start — so as a result, you want to make yourself appear to be not so much of a threat that people will target you. You want them directing their sights at someone else, not you. Thus, a fair amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> is involved in making yourself appear much less of a threat than you actually are. Naturally this leads to a lot of sitting around and letting someone else strategize, so that they make themselves appear to be the threat, not you. Maggie Ausburn won her season for this reason.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace">Rupauls Drag Race</a></em>, Bianca Del Rio's looks were always fabulous, but were always in the same simple silhouette. As her competitor BenDeLaCreme put it, Bianca had "50 of the same dress in different fabrics". However, Bianca's no-nonsense attitude and skills in acting and comedy outweighed her relatively tame runway looks, and she went on to win her season as well as become one of the most popular season winners in the entire series.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a>'s first ever <em>Wanna Be A VJ?</em> competition in 1998, the winner was Jesse Camp, who won the viewer votes with his energetic personality and punk rock aesthetic. However, MTV also hired the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunnerUpTakesItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunnerUpTakesItAll">second-place winner</a>, the more conventional and laid back Dave Holmes. Holmes may have seemed boring compared to Camp, but the executives saw him as more professional on camera, plus he was knowledgeable about a wide range of music whereas Camp only really lit up when talking about punk or heavy metal. As a result, Holmes stayed with MTV for 4 years and continues to work as a media personality, whereas Camp was only kept on for one contractually-obligated year and faded to obscurity after his album flopped.

<ul><li> The sport of Billiards was killed by its professionals getting too good at it in a very boring way. This is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_billiards">English Billiards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a game involving three balls with points scored by potting, or having the cue ball going in-off, or hitting both other balls with the cue ball for a "cannon". It was a significant professional sport in the 1800s and early 1900s. But then the best professionals got so good that they could play basically forever in a very boring way. The culmination was a break of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Reece">499,135 points<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which took five weeks to make, but consisted of the same shot being made hundreds of thousands of times, to perfection. While attempts were made to save the game with rule changes, it was supplanted as a professional sport in the UK and some other countries by Snooker. To see how exciting outstanding billiards is, here is a video of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omt645QMVk#t=48">an excellent player making a series of "nursery cannons"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Of course English Billiards can be exciting: this was the game played in Billiards rooms in a thousand murder mysteries and in Clue/Cluedo.
</li><li> The simplest version of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carom_billiards#Straight_rail">Carom Billiards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the USA was played professionally for only 6 years before the players killed it by being too good at being boring.
</li><li> Hand-to-hand fighting.
<ul><li> Certainly martial arts styles like Tae Kwon Do and Capoeira seem very visually appealing, with all the fancy flips, cartwheels and jump kicks, but even these flashier ones usually cut the crap in serious situations.
</li><li> In most competitive martial arts sparring, 95% of the points are scored with the most basic moves.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a>, basics have dominated, and coaches will often chastise their fighter if they try to go crazy. Exotic submissions and acrobatic striking moves rarely work, though some fighters have developed reputations for the efficacy of their flashier moves.
</li><li> Arguably the two most effective martial arts are traditional western styles that the average person probably doesn't even associate with the term "martial arts".
<ul><li> Wrestling. It's not for nothing that the vast majority of UFC heavyweight champions have had wrestling as their main martial art. Grappling arts overall are often regarded as this trope in MMA fights. Fighters often manage to simply control their opponents for the duration of the fight en route to a safe decision victory or put them in a submission rather than take a chance with more exciting offensive moves for a stoppage.
</li><li> Boxing. It only uses the closed fist to attack, and with only four basic attacks (jab, cross, hook, uppercut). Using only the hands to attack allows boxers to support the fists with <em>the entire body</em>, making them more powerful, and also to use the legs to move better and avoid taking damage by simply dodging. Martial artists from other styles, and even entire martial arts, have included boxing-style punches and derivative footwork precisely because they're just that effective.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The neutral zone trap in hockey. Essentially, it's a very heavy defensive strategy that prevents the attacking team from getting close to the net by pinning them in the neutral zone with no way to get around the defense. Critics complain it is extremely boring to watch (neither team really gets a lot of scoring chances as a result), but if done effectively it is very difficult to beat. In response to criticisms of this strategy during its heyday in the late 90s and early 00s, the NHL made several rule changes to open up the gameit made obstruction penalties a point of emphasis for officials, introduced a restricted area behind the goal where goaltenders cannot play the puck, and changed the "offside pass" or "two-line pass" rule so that the center line is no longer relevant in the rule's enforcement. While the trap still exists in today's NHL, it's been greatly modified to reflect these changes.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RollerDerby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RollerDerby">Roller Derby</a>, the four-wall and passive offense. It can be excruciatingly boring to watch a jammer grind fruitlessly away at four blockers in a flat or braced wall formation, but it's also the most effective defense in the game.
</li><li> Baseball
<ul><li> The majority of runs are scored as a result of "boring" things like walks and singles. Home runs are great when they happen, but even the most prolific home run hitters can hit a home run only about once every thirteen plate appearances on average.
</li><li> Walking in itself could be considered this. For most of baseball's history, no one paid much attention to the ability to draw walks, and batting average, which did not take walks into account, was by far the most widely-used statistic to measure offensive output. With the rise of sabermetrics, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOfNerds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOfNerds">objective statistical analysis</a>, in the 21st century, the value of the base on balls has since come to be recognized, to the point where it's no longer an undervalued skill.
</li><li> A pitcher that rings up a lot of strikeouts is great to watch, but since strikeouts take at least three pitches, many hard-throwing strikeout artists tend to be less physically durable over the course of a season than a pitcher who's better at getting batters to hit groundouts and popouts (of course, the <em>best</em> pitchers tend to be strikeout artists who are <em>also</em> good at inducing weak contact).
</li></ul></li><li> American Football: Big passes and fancy trick plays are crowd-pleasers. But teams can often get even more mileage out of quick passes to the center of the field. It's not difficult to get 5 or 6 yards minimum per pass this way, and if you have a good tight end or receiving tailback, or a wideout that runs a lot of short patterns to the middle, they can rack up yardage while the big-play players are given more coverage. A team who can get consistent gains on boring runs up the middle will quickly wear out the opposing defense, which will leave their opponent helpless to stop either their running or their passing attacks in the late stages of the game. This is why there were so many Super Bowl routs from the mid-'80s to '90s: the AFC teams, with their flashy passing attacks led by quarterbacks from the 1983 draft class and their light 3-4 defenses, were physically dominated by the power running games and smash-mouth defenses of NFC teams of the time.
<ul><li> Vince Lombardi built most of his career on a single play- the Power Sweep. While not the only play in his book of course, it was the most practiced, and John Madden once related a story where, visiting a seminar by Lombardi, the coach spent <em>the entire 8-hour seminar</em> talking about that one play.
</li><li> On defense, the concept of the two-deep zone. While it does have some drawbacks, such as being vulnerable to the run, it is very effective at preventing long passing plays by an offense. It also has the advantage of being simpler to execute than other styles of defense.
</li><li> Special teams, the occasional big return and frequent game-winning field goals aside, are pretty boring to watch. They're also incredibly important, as good special teams make life much easier for both the offense and defense by reducing the distance to travel and increasing the space to work with, respectively. It also helps that special-teamers are really cheap compared to the rest of an NFL team, in both cap space and draft capital.
<ul><li> Know also that because of their longevity (kickers rarely take hits and therefore dominate the oldest players lists), placekickers are 49 of the top 50 scorers in NFL history. A good kicker can last <strong>decades</strong>. To put it another way, the average NFL career is 3.5 years. Of current NFL starting kickers (as of November 2018), their average career is just shy of 8 years.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Basketball:
<ul><li> Two of the most reliable sources of points are layups and free throws.
</li><li> In recent years, as the NBA has gotten into the same "moneyball" trends as the MLB, this has been turned around on its head. Mid-range jump shots<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4dgar');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4dgar" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4dgar');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">usually defined as anything outside the free-throw lane and inside the three-point line</span> are being deemphasized in favor of close-in-play (higher scoring percentage and a high likelihood of being fouled) and three-pointers (the probability of an offensive rebound is better, and the chance of the extra point is statistically enough to make it worthwhile rather than pushing inside the line).
</li><li> The shot clock was introduced largely to eliminate the viability of boring "four corners offense", which consisted mostly of passing the ball around without even trying to get a shot for as much as five minutes at a time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a>:
<ul><li> The sport suffered from an overdose of Boring but Practical heavy defensive tactics during the early 2000's.
</li><li> The catenaccio or counter-attacking family of tactics falls under a similar category. The aim is for the team to defend with as many as 10 men, whilst only one or two players remain in attacking positions, hoping to get to a loose ball and create an opportunity from it. Due to the difficulty of attacking a team that is defending with many players (especially when done well, like Inter in the 50s/60s) added to the lack of attacks created by a team using this technique, many pundits now call this "anti-football". It is however extremely effective in levelling chances between teams of different level, so most teams that expect to lose a game will play in this fashion.
</li><li> In football, heavy defense tactics (known by fans as "Parking the (team) bus") are meant to frustrate the opponent team by preventing it from scoring in any way possible. This goads the opponents into attacking your goal more desperately, while you wait for a "lucky break" for a surprise attack on their weakened defenses. At this point, the heavy-defenders then usually go into an even heavier defensive to protect this advantage in score, making it even less likely to see more goals later in the game. The result, for everyone but the diehard fans of the defensive team, is that the majority of the game is itself extremely frustrating and usually promises a very small final score (1-0 and such). The period culminated in the 2002 World Cup, where the German team made extremely effective use of this technique for the majority of the tournament, winning the first three elimination rounds at exactly 1-0 each. However, this was subverted when they lost the final to the Brazilians, against whom defensive tactics don't usually work.
</li><li> Boring but Practical came back with Greece's performance two years later, at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship">UEFA Euro</a> 2004, winning the whole tournament in the process.
</li><li> Also, Chelsea beat the flashy and seemingly unbeatable Barcelona in the 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UEFAChampionsLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UEFAChampionsLeague">UEFA Champions League</a> with this extreme defense (at times, 9 or 10 players would be next to the goal...).
</li><li> Italian football is mainly based on this. The above-mentioned catenaccio? An Italian tactic (whose name is the Italian word for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">security bolt</a>"). Inter, that in the 50s and 60s was mostly known for pulling the catenaccio well? One of the big four of Italian football. The reason for the success of Juventus (the dominant team since the late 90s), ChievoVerona in its first few seasons in Serie A, and the Italian national team? Excellent teamwork. In fact, the Italian national team is often hated by international fans for being boring, but is one of the best teams in history, and has won the World Cup <em>four times</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball">Handball<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the penalty for "passive play" (i.e. not developing enough of a drive towards the goal) was introduced to kill the incredibly boring but incredibly promising strategy of sitting on the ball and just throwing it around for as long as possible. Unlike similar rules in American sports, it's not based on any measurable thing but instead the referee just lifts their hand as a warning and a couple of seconds later (unless an attempt to score a goal is made) issues the penalty, which always includes the forfeiture of ball possession. Given that the definitions involved are rather subjective, the referee's decisions can be controversial.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a>, a strong serve is this. Serving balls so fast that points end almost immediately without your opponent even being able to get their racquet on the ball makes for more boring viewing than flashy trick shots or long rallies, but it works.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>
<ul><li> <em>Magic Missile</em> is one of the most basic arcane spells, as well as one of the most practical. The damage it deals is sub-par — at its basic level, the spell is three darts of 1d4 + 1 force damage each. As a tradeoff, Magic Missile <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">always hits</a></em>. It ignores damage resistances and elemental resistances, ignores incorporeality, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSavingThrow">does not allow a saving throw to reduce or negate its effects</a>. The only things that can stop Magic Missile are spell resistance/immunity (uncommon at low-mid levels), a specific spell (<em>Shield</em>) or a specific consumable item (Brooch of Shielding). And as a 1st level spell, you'll always have plenty of spell slots available for it, and it becomes prime material for metamagic feats later in the game. In 4th Edition, Magic Missile is one of the few wizard powers that count as a ranged basic attack, meaning it gets bonuses from a lot of equipment and can be used for extra attacks granted by certain leader classes.
</li><li> In 4th Edition, all classes have "at-will" powers (<em>Magic Missile</em> being one), which are all examples of this trope — they can be used as many times as desired without using a spell slot, where the flashier, more powerful abilities can only be used occasionally. As such, boosting the power of these abilities is a boring but practical way to make your character stronger.
</li><li> For a 3rd Edition wizard, many of the most powerful spells are not flashy direct-damage spells like <em>Fireball</em> or <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, but spells that weaken the enemy, like <em>Ray of Enfeeblement</em> or <em>Web</em>, which can turn a potentially deadly fight into a cakewalk.
</li><li> The 3rd Edition cleric lacks the finesse of the Rogue, the combat prowess of the Fighter, and the impressive offensive magic light show of the Wizard. Furthermore, it is expected to fill the thankless, inglorious task of healing and supporting the party. Most of the glory is vicarious, by allowing the party members to survive and do better at their respective jobs, but a party without a cleric is virtually hamstrung.
</li><li> "Utility spells" such as <em>Water Breathing</em>, <em>Rope Trick</em>, and <em>Stone to Mud</em> aren't much use in combat, but they can save the party's life in a pinch and provide other extremely useful benefits outside of combat. Basic spells such as <em>Light</em> and <em>Detect Magic</em> are vital even at the highest levels.
</li><li> The most important magic items in 3.5 are the ones that increases your stats. They take precedence over anything else that uses the same slot. Also, items that do cool or unusual things are often priced too high to be useful by the time you can get them.
</li><li> In 3.X edition, playing as an ordinary human rather than an exotic fantasy race might sound boring, but it provides the best all-around game benefits: a bonus feat (giving you a jump-start on later, powerful feats), an extra skill point each level (which has more of an effect on skills than a one-time stat bonus) and allows more freedom from penalties while multiclassing (freeing up the player to create a more impressive character build).
</li><li> Also in 3.X, the Improved Initiative feat is valuable to almost every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass">Character Class</a> for the simple reason that it boosts your chances of acting before your enemy in combat. The Alert feat in 5th Edition performs the same function, with the added bonus that you also cannot be surprised.
</li><li> While they rarely are "boring", the Bard is actually one of the most practical characters in the game. They may not be able to fight as well as the Fighter or do damage like the Barbarian, but they are up there near the top. They may not have the ultra-powerful or flashy spells of the Wizard, Sorcerer, or Druid, but their spells are a much wider variety. They can cast both offensively and defensively, and they can heal as well. They have the second-most skill knowledge behind the Rogue, and their high Charisma score means the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> skills of Bluff, Intimidate, and Diplomacy are going to have excellent bonuses. They also get abilities like <em>Hideous Laughter</em> and <em>Uncontrollable Dance</em> which incapacitate an enemy if they succeed, allowing everyone else to wail on them.
</li><li> In D&amp;D 5th edition, at level 2, the Rogue gets access to a class feature called Cunning Action, allowing them to use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage or Hide. Sounds lame, until you realize it lets you outrun many enemies, move to tactically advantageous positions (like, say, flanking) much more easily, as well as enabling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a> against a group of enemy (standard action, shoot a bow. Move action, break line of sight. Bonus action, find a new sniping spot or Hide to gain advantage for sneak attack next turn).
</li><li> Also from 5E, the Champion Fighter subclass, which is a throwback to the "classic" Fighters of past editions. No magic, no fiddly skills, just a big block of stats with a ton of passive bonuses to make for a deadly combatant and exceptional physical skills. Champions can get an expanded critical hit range, an additional fighting style and some really impressive damage output when you combine with their extra attacks and their Action Surge ability. And they get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a> when below half their maximum HP too.
</li><li> There are a few Feats in 5E that definitely qualify. Alert gives a big boost to your Initiative and so you always have a good chance to go first when combat starts, it helps protect you from sneak attacks, and you can't be surprised. Observant gives you a big boost to passive Perception and Investigation, so you'll hardly ever miss any loot, traps, hidden enemies, or important clues. Tough gives you +2 HP with every level up. None of them do anything really flashy, but they <em>definitely</em> will save your bacon when it matters, especially early on when player characters are quite easily killed, <em>especially</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>.
</li><li> The Human race. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonBadass">"Why play a human in a fantasy game?"</a> is a question you will hear a lot, but depending on what version you play, you can get a +1 to every core stat (standard human) or a +1 to any two core stats, a free skill proficiency, and a free feat (variant human). Variant human is considered a top tier race pick for any class, one of the rare occassions that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> is high on a game's tier list.
</li><li> From 3.X, the Feat <em>Power Attack</em>. Take a -X Attack penalty, to get +X Damage bonus to melee attacks. However, with two-handed weapons, the damage bonus is <em>doubled</em>. This stacks on top of the x1.5 Strength bonus damage already given for wielding a non-light weapon with two hands. Practically, the most important feat any serious two-handed melee weapon user can pick up, as that damage quickly adds up, regardless if you're a very basic, core standard Fighter, or a Tome of Battle Warblade. It's also a gateway feat to a number of other important and useful combat feats, and a number of Prestige Classes. And it is almost always one of the very first feats anyone picks up on any melee specialist classes.
</li><li> Speaking of Tome of Battle, the Warblade's exclusive Martial Discipline, Iron Heart. There is nothing extremely flashy about it, just simply normal basics of sword fighting and will-power trained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> until it hits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> levels. Why worry about what a foe may or may not be immune to, when you can just simply hit'em really hard with one attack, or wipe out a horde of enemies with maneuvers that are flat out better than a similar Feat which requires other feats to even use. Or even just simply parry the enemy's attack.
</li><li> The "Horizon Tripper" build - Barbarian/Fighter/Ranger/Horizon Walker. As "optimized" builds go, it's not much more than a well-traveled guy with a pole weapon and a short-ranged teleport, and its craziest maneuver is simply tripping someone. But it's effective at basically all levels, has a decent amount of skill points to make it useful out of combat, and is unusually mobile for a combat character. And being made exclusively from core material and fairly basic in its lore, there's very few Dungeon Masters who wouldn't allow it.
</li><li> In general, having a character carry an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">Emergency Weapon</a>, for those times when a wizard's magic spells do nothing, or can't be used, or when that sneaky rogue finds out that skeletons don't die easily to being backstabbed. In such cases, a wizard might want to use a crossbow, or perhaps some other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RangedEmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RangedEmergencyWeapon">Ranged Emergency Weapon</a>, and rogues might want to grab a club to break that skeleton's bones. Even if a character lacks proficiency, having any backup weapon is better than relying upon their fists alone, unless they are a monk, have an inborn unarmed attack, or picked up a feat that allows for improved unarmed fighting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rolemaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rolemaster">Rolemaster</a></em> has the spell Shockbolt. It's not a very powerful attack spell, as attack spells go, but it has a few advantages over some others. Because it's a low level spell, it doesn't take much magic to use. It's available to two of the three groups of magic types on base spell lists, and to some others on special spell lists, so most spellcasters can cast it. The actual attack is a sort of electrically charged light, so it works better against a target with metal armor. In this system, you're as likely to kill something with a critical hit as by sheer damage, and shockbolt does criticals against metal-armored targets rather better than against targets protected with leather or cloth armor. The effect is so pronounced that metal armor is generally not much valued because this single spell makes metal armor a liability.
</li><li> The armies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> offer loads of appealing units to select, be they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">super soldiers encased in powered armor that can punch holes in tanks and survive being stepped on by mecha</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">battlesuits unleashing volleys of plasma fire while darting in and out of cover</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">tanks the size of bunkers that can annihilate entire squads in a single shot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">genetically-engineered warbeasts that spit fire and toss around enemy armor like toys</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">speed-crazed alien brutes on crude motorcycles loaded with guns</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">teleporting shock troops firing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss">monofilament threads</a>, and so forth. But at the end of the battle none of these units will matter unless you have some humble Troops choices, the rank-and-file of your army, to hold mission objectives.
<ul><li> However, the above-mentioned speed-crazed alien brutes can take motorcycles as troops choices simply by taking a cheap special character.
</li><li> For that matter, the average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Guardsman's</a> lasrifle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Compared to everyone else's standard firearm</a>, it's so weak that they're commonly nicknamed "flashlights". Compared to everyone else's standard firearm, it's also the most practical gun humanity has ever invented. Extremely low maintenance and can be recharged anywhere, and is completely idiot-proof so as not to confuse conscripts from some of the less advanced Imperium worlds. And while weak <em>comparatively</em> it still kills humans and 'nids just fine, not to mention cheap enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">to be shipped out by the hundred thousand</a>.
<ul><li> This is also why the Commissar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> (<strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">HERO OF THE IMPERIUM</a></strong>) prefers the bog-standard laspistol over the much more potent hellpistol or boltpistol. A boltpistol fires .50 calibre explosive shells that can stop a raging Ork dead in its tracks, but also take up so much space in a magazine that ammunition is hugely limited. Plus, it is far heavier than a laspistol and Cain worries that the increased weight of a boltpistol will throw off his aim at a crucial moment and get him killed.
</li></ul></li><li> The bog-standard model of the Leman Russ Main Battle Tank, both in-'verse and on the tabletop. It lacks the flash of the more specialized models of the same chassis, and the sheer power of super-heavies like the Baneblade, but they're cheap, plentiful and can perform well (if not excel) in almost any role.
</li><li> Missile launchers and autocannons are by far the most versatile Heavy Weapon available to human armies — hardly flashy, like Plasma Cannons or Lascannons, but they have good anti-infantry capability (frag missiles for the ML and a high fire-rate for the AC) and can kill anything up to Armor: 13.
</li><li> A meta-example is the heavy stubber, which is the M2 heavy machine gun in all but name. When a weapon that uses gunpowder to throw solid projectiles doesn't need updating for <em>forty thousand years</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">you know it's practical</a>.
<ul><li> In the same vein, the Earthshaker cannon is nothing but a simple gun-howitzer using bagged charges, an invention that predates the M2 by almost twenty years. It's one of the Imperial Guard's most formidable weapons. Indeed, most Imperial Guard implements of war can be considered boring but practical: in a universe with spider-tanks, hover-tanks and cathedrals on treads, whatever grace or technological sophistication that the Guard lacks can be more than made up for by sheer weight of numbers and raw reliability.
</li></ul></li><li> Indeed, for most armies in any of the Games Workshop big games (Warhammer, Warhammer 40,000, and Lord of the Rings), it's <em>generally</em> a good idea to cross off the most expensive units in their force from attempts to build serious armies. The reason is fairly simple; any extremely powerful unit is going to take up a lot of the points an army gets, leaving the rest of the army weaker. It'll get blasted by canonballs, a hero killer, or tanks because it is such a big investment on your part, leaving your force crippled. Even if your opponent doesn't have a powerful answer to <em>kill</em> that behemoth, he maybe can tie it up so it doesn't damage anything important while the rest his army crushes your force. For example, one solution to facing a dragon in LotR is to feed it a mook every turn; sure, the mook is doomed, but the dragon is likely impotent to do anything else and cost so many points the rest of your army can sweep the enemy with little trouble. Likewise, if a new player insists on a huge squad of assault terminators you can't kill, skating around them will mean that incredibly expensive unit does too little damage to justify its massive cost. Boring but practical wins cutthroat games.
</li><li> By far the most efficient way for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Imperial Guard</a> players to defeat monstrous creatures, especially Tyranids, is to ring them with conscripts, shoot the rest of the army around them, then, once everything is well under control, maybe charge them with a command squad and try to get a force weapon and a couple of powerfists in contact with them.
</li><li> Another Imperial Guard example: the army's Elite choices (as in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">Ratling snipers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOgresAreHungrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOgresAreHungrier">Ogyrns</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Stormtroopers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Psykers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Sly Marbo</a>) are generally considered to be too ineffectual for their points costs. Hence, most Guard players who aren't playing for fun prefer leaving them behind in favour of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">simply bringing more Guardsmen</a>.
</li><li> The theoretical concept of "Mathhammer" is built on this, usually comparing several types of units within a certain points limit in the scenarios they were built for and seeing which one is more cost efficient. This usually means that most players would build their army not with the best units in the codex, but with the cheapest ones that can pack some sort of heavy firepower (such as the Meltavets, who dies faster than any other anti-tank squad, but can kill way more in the small time frame that they're alive, at least statistically).
</li><li> Again from the Imperial Guard: the <a class="urllink" href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Chimera">Chimera troop transport<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's just a vehicle with thin armour, some medium weapons more suited for anti-infantry job, and the ability to carry ten Guardsmen. It's also <em>very</em> cheap and even more reliable and easy to repair, and its chassis is versatile enough to be adapted as a number of vehicles ranging from a humble tractor/supply truck to a <em>mobile ICBM launcher</em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Arkhan_Land">Arkhan Land<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has discovered three vehicle designs which are currently in use by the Imperium. Two of them are the Land Raider and the Land Speeder, a tank and a recon unit, respectively. However, there is a third vehicle, one not as common in the tabletop, yet often considered much more important for the Imperium... the Land <em>Crawler</em>, a cheap utility vehicle used as a transport, a tractor, a vehicle to clear the field... and, if needed, you can use it tow artillery, or replace the engine and slap on a few stubbers to make an excellent recon vehicle.
</li><li> The ubiquitous Rhino chassis is this both in and out of universe. Its simple form makes it highly adaptable, with almost every space marine ground tank (besides the famous Land Raider) being based around its chassis. This simplicity also allows it to be mass produced on the cheap and allows even the modest crew to make battlefield repairs (something no other tank in the game is capable of). In terms of practicality, it can transport 10 superhuman soldiers clad in power armor with no difficulty AND can run off any type of fuel from exotic promethium to <em>wood</em>. All of this translates into the game as a generic transport, with a decent (and, due to a rule wording, indestructible) gun and transport capacity for a very low point cost (35, compared to an individual Space Marine at 14 points apiece). Its size and bulk also makes it good for impromptu cover, as most commanders will rush the Rhino up, turn it sideways, and have the troops disembark on the other side, effectively shielding them for a turn from enemy gunfire. Its derivative tanks are also very practical, being able to bring twice the amount of ordinance to bear for half the cost of other equivalent tanks.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5o4m7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5o4m7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5o4m7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A single Predator tank can bring either the same amount of lascannons to bear as a Land Raider for half the price, or two Predators for the same price can bring 3 times the amount of lascannons. Alternatively it can field them with Autocannons and heavy bolters for even cheaper, making them much more efficient at gunning down enemy infantry. In addition, since you can field two Predators for the cost of one Land Raider, you can afford to specialize them, so they can concentrate on the type of enemy they are most effective against, rather than the Land Raider occasionally wasting shots because its guns are split between anti-tank and anti-infantry. Similarly, the Vindicator brings to bear the powerful Demolisher Cannon for 2/3rds the cost of a Demolisher Leman Russ or Defiler.</span> Their only real downside is that even the most heavily armored Rhino Tank would be considered, at best, a "medium" tank, and the majority of them can be taken down with relatively few shots from anti-tank weapons, especially when flanked. However, their cheap cost means you can simply spam them to make up for this.
</li><li> In the same vein as the Rhino, the Predator MTB (which is based off of the rhino chassis) is overshadowed by the insane durability of the Land Raider, the demolisher cannon of the Vindicator, the anti-air array of the Hunter and Stalkers, and the sheer dakka of the Thunderfire Cannon. However, if you need a job done, no other tank in the space marine arsenal can do it better or cheaper. Armed with either 3 sets of Lascannons, an autocannon and 2 heavy bolters, or a combination thereof, the Predator can bring a lot of firepower for a pittance of a cost, and with the 7th Edition Marine Codex allowing for vehicle squadrons you can bring up to <em>nine</em> Predators to a battle.
</li><li> Every Space Marine Chapter has its own specialization. The Space Wolves are tough melee fighters, the Raven Guard are masters of guerilla warfare and rapid assault, the Salamanders love flamethrowers, and the Ultramarines... have a thing for logistics. Guess which one is the one with the 500-world empire?
</li><li> Captain Lysander of the Imperial Fists. A pretty good close combat character, but that's not why you take him. Instead, you take him for his ability of "Bolter Drill", which allows his fellow Space marines re-roll missed Bolter shots. This applies to ANY bolter type weapon, including the Heavy Bolter, and Bolt Pistol. Boring as hell, but damn effective at wiping a field of enemy infantry quickly when you suddenly have a lot more chances to wound the enemy.
</li><li> The Tau, one of the most technologically advanced races of the game, tend to focus their battle strategy around Battlesuits. Their Shas'O Commanders are often given the most advanced Battlesuit tech the Tau Empire has to offer. And yet, two of of the best HQ choices are the extremely cheap points cost wise Ethereal, and Cadre Fireblade. The Etheral has little combat ability, and while they can fight in Close Combat, you really don't want to have them anywhere near it. The Fireblade wears the same Combat armor as the regular Fire Warriors, and carries a Pulse rifle, and both may have two drones with them (Likely shield drones for extra survivability). Both have buffs that are given, to units they are near to, or with. Namely, the Ethereal's Storm of Fire buff, and the Fireblade's Volley Fire. When their per-requisite conditions are met grant an additional shot to Pulse Rifles, and Pulse Carbines, to any unit they are close to, or joined respectively. For way less points than every other unit option available for the Tau, these two HQ choices suddenly turn your Firewarriors and Pathfinders and into terrors of the battlefield, shredding apart infantry with massed amounts of fire from their basic weapons.
<ul><li> Taken to the extreme with the special character Aun'Va. He's gone from the worst Special character in the entire game from his previous incarnation, to almost a "Must-Have" unit in any non-Farsight Enclave rules using Tau army. He can invoke an additional power, which means you can leave Storm of Fire always active, and then one of the three other Elemental Invocations make surrounding infantry units tougher, less likely to run, or more aggressively mobile. And thanks to his Paradox of Duality, he put's the normal strategy of using High Strength, Armor Piercing weapons on its head, making it likely to fail when fired at him. Combined with clever use of cover, this will frustrate enemies trying to eliminate this huge morale booster to the Tau. Not bad for a choice, where it's very likely that when used correctly, will never earn a kill on its own.
</li></ul></li><li> The Adeptus Mechanicus Skitarii soldiers, best described as the Imperial Guard crossed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">the Borg</a> have a fairly diverse army list, with spider-tanks, chicken-walkers jousting with taser-lances, spindly mech-assassins with brain-destroying weaponry and gargantuan combat robots, but the undisputed best unit in the army is the Skitarii Vanguard. A basic trooper in a red robe and sealed armour, they're churned out and discarded in the tens of thousands, and yet are considered some of the best infantry in the game thanks to cheap cost, ease of use, surprisingly powerful basic guns and access to good anti-tank weaponry and accuracy buffs. Armed with a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Arc Rifles</a> per squad, there's almost nothing in the game they can't hurt, and you need do nothing more than point them at the nearest enemy and forget about them. Unless limited by army slots, it's a rare Skitarii player that doesn't field at least three squads of these guys.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> the Dark Elf army has two major close combat core choices: Warriors which are just basic soldiers with spears and shields, or Corsairs which are kickass Dark Elf Pirates with two swords (or a sword and a crossbow pistol), wearing cloaks made of dragon skin. Unfortunately, Warriors are much cheaper and roughly equally effective, meaning that there's no logical reason to take Corsairs over them. It doesn't hurt that Dark Elf Warriors are among the most effective for their points basic infantry in the game.
<ul><li> This is less true under the 8th edition Army Book, with Corsairs getting more durable and basic Warriors (sorry, Dreadspears) getting more expensive. But it's still...mostly true.
</li><li> The tiny little cantrip "Unbind Monster" in Storm of Magic can sledgehammer your enemy by turning all their bound monsters into corpses, idiots, and/or rampaging, uncontrolled killing machines that attack the nearest target. Back this up with the equally minor "Wizard's Duel", to push enemy casters off their fulcrums, and victory is in your grasp.
</li><li> While there are a lot of fancy arcane items (both "generic" and army specific) for your wizards to pick through, none is more useful than the humble dispel scroll, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">which automatically dispels one spell per game.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, some of the best cards in the game have completely generic effects, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=692">but<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=633">for<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=728">cheap<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Sadly, the cards linked above are also banned from most tournament formats, possibly for exactly that same reason.
<ul><li> What do you think is the rarest, most expensive, and widely accepted as best card in the game? Some stompy behemoth that ends the game in one turn? Some spell that gives you an instantaneous win? Nope: <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=600">It's a card that gives you three free mana. Once. That's about it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Many new players have likely traded it away back in the day for some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">giant creature that later became obsolete</a>, without ever realizing just how much of an advantage Black Lotus can give early game. Zvi Mowshowitz, a tournament player, designer for Wizards of the Coast, and eventual <em>Magic</em> Hall of Famer, once said there was not a deck that could be built that could not be improved by adding a Black Lotus to it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the beginning, Magic tournaments were often dominated by big, flashy spells, things like dragons, angels, and demons. Then one player got the idea of using small, crappy creatures that most players ignored for a fast beatdown, with the idea being that a big, flashy spell is no good if the other guy is too dead to cast it. A few nearly one-sided tournaments later, the "weenie" archetype that we (Magic players) all know and love was born.
<ul><li> Cards don't get much simpler than <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191089">Lightning Bolt,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> yet it's so good that it wasn't printed in a tournament legal set for 14 years. It only returned due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a>, which is remarkably small considering the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">enduring</a> nature. Lampshaded hilariously in <a class="urllink" href="http://loadingreadyrun.com/videos/view/1931/Crapshots-Ep87-The-Sculptor">this short video by Loading Ready Run<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Blue Deck Eaters, especially those with lots of counterspells. No, you don't hit enemies with massive monsters or blast him with uber-powerful spells. All you basically say is "No, you don't cast that" when you counter his spells, and "No, you can't have those" when you force him to discard. It's not flashy, but once it starts working, it will defeat most any deck out there, except those specifically made to counter that mechanism.
</li><li> Blue-White control decks takes this trope to its most literal meaning. With a slew of cheap blue counterspells and white removal, you effectively render your opponent impotent throughout the entire match while either digging up your own combo or pinging him with consistent yet hard to remove damage. As expected, when your opponent has to face the likes of <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=render+silent&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Render Silent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/m14/en/35.html">Silence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> every single turn, it gets hilariously annoying and boring for them, especially if you just wiped the field (so they don't have any existing stuff to use either).
</li><li> Token strategies center around this. "Dies to removal" is a common complaint about creatures, and token creatures are no exception. However, unlike regular creatures, tokens are, more often than not, designed to just keep coming. And coming. And coming. They seldom have any abilties, and seldom more anything more complex than flying, but when you have an army well into the triple digits, the fact that it's a bunch of 1/1 saprolings is hardly relevant. And we didn't even mention empowering this horde...
</li><li> This even applies to basic lands. Lands give you the mana to cast other spells, and are the most reliable way to get mana. Each basic land gives you one mana of its color and can be used as soon as it's played. There are many varieties of lands that give you life, damage your opponent, or give you a choice of different mana types. They almost always have some disadvantage, however, like costing life to play, only giving colorless mana, or not being usable on the turn they enter the field.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=488400">Solemn Simulacrum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> may be a little frail for its cost, but it lets you get a land into play to accelerate your mana base. And when it dies, you draw a card, effectively replacing itself when it's used as a chump blocker. Clone or reanimate it, and you can get a lot of additional card advantage from it. Plus, it's colorless so it can go in any deck, supplementing colors that normally don't have good access to ramp and/or card draw.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=79217">One of the best legendaries in the game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> appeared in <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em> set. A vanilla 2/2 creature normally wouldn't be all that impressive — except this one only costs <em>one white mana</em> to play.
</li><li> There are exactly three cards banned in every single format they're available in, even in formats where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">the Power Nine</a> are allowed to be played.

However, all three cards were so horrible to play against that they're one of the few cards that don't involve ante or have the "Conspiracy" card type and yet are banned in all formats.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/78/unsummon">Unsummon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and similar cards removes a creature from the game for only one mana, but your opponent can still use that card later. If you use it on a creature with high mana cost, your opponent will have to spend all that mana again, and if you use it on a creature with loads of counters, you've reset them to their base power and toughness.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWitcherGameOfImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWitcherGameOfImagination">The Witcher: Game of Imagination</a></em> based entire combat mechanics on this trope, bordering on extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism">Combat Pragmatism</a> when it comes to dirty tricks that can used against enemies. Also:
<ul><li> Shields are one of the most overlooked gear in the game, since they don't look impressive at all. Yet they prove absurdly powerful and useful bonuses to defense and can be used for attacks too, dealing damage on par with regular weapons.
</li><li> Cavalry? Charging mob? Some giant monster? Just take a steady grab of few pikes or other polearms.
</li><li> Plate armour. Unlike other tabletop RPGs, The Witcher doesn't add any arbitrary drawbacks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note700z7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note700z7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note700z7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in combat at least — armour provides hefty penalties, but only <em>outside</em> combat</span> other than the price itself, which isn't that high anyway. If it is combined with a shield, you are untouchable by anything short of dragons and high-end spells.
</li><li> Applying good ol' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a> can completely take male enemies off-guard. If they fail a check against it, <em>they lose their turn</em>. And said check can be pretty hard to pass.
</li></ul></li><li> While the <em>Lord of the Rings TCG</em> usually averted this, with most cards being a part of a complicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> combo, the Goblin Runner card is the epitome of this trope. A simple Strength 5 (barely stronger than a Hobbit) Goblin with no special abilities...but he costs 1 from Shadow Pool to play and you can add 2 to the Shadow Pool when you play him. This means you can build up your Shadow Pool when you play them, so many early decks, especially Moria decks, built their strategy around them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>'s metagame is faced with a similar situation. Finally summoned your almighty <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Master_Knight">Dragon Master Knight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>? Or maybe <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Hero_Divine_Neos">Elemental Hero Divine Neos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>? Too bad, they're just as vulnerable to traps like <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mirror_Force">Mirror Force<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as Kuriboh is. Unless you're summoning something that is immune or can shut down traps, it's usually much better to go with something simple, like <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon">Cyber Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose effect is simply: "Summon for free if you don't have any monsters out and your opponent does".
<ul><li> For example, the most effective tactics at one point of the game are to manage your card advantage, and abuse advantageous monsters like the Disc Commander, Monarch and LADD. A very boring yet highly effective strategy.
<ul><li> A simple example of this is Lightning Vortex versus Smashing Ground. Smashing Ground destroys the highest-DEF monster on your opponent's field, while Lightning Vortex destroys all face-up monsters on your opponent's field but requires you to discard a card. Smashing Ground is a +0, since you used one card (Smashing Ground) to take out one card (the opponent's monster), while Lightning Vortex varies from a -1 to a +3, since you used two cards (Lightning Vortex and the discarded card) to take out one to five cards (the opponent's monsters). Smashing Ground is considered a better card than Lightning Vortex, because it's much more likely for your opponent to have one or two monsters than four or five, so Lightning Vortex will usually just break even.
</li><li> The Gadgets deck, at their first peak of popularity, embodied the significance of card advantage. Because the Gadgets search each other out on Summon, you will consistently have a stream of monsters to beat on the opponent's LP, while using spot removal to get rid of cards you can't surmount. While the Gadgets themselves didn't have very impressive stats, the massive amount of removal ensures the opponent will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">run out of resources before you do</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This has changed to a degree since the introduction of Synchro Monsters. <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shooting_Star_Dragon">Shooting Star Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for instance, is possible but difficult to summon, but amazing when you do. Same goes for <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Nova_Dragon">Red Nova Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Also, Synchros have higher ATK than the stars of previous metas, so managing to summon that Dragon Master Knight might actually do you a tiny scrap of good.
</li><li> Nowadays, there's a notable amount of decks where the strategy revolves around summoning a big flashy monster every single turn effectively.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mystical_Space_Typhoon">Mystical Space Typhoon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has one of the simplest effects in the game. It was released in 2002, and still sees plenty of use <em>to this day</em>.
</li><li> Pot of Greed is either banned or restricted in multiple YGO formats. Its effect is three simple words: "draw two cards", but it really translates to a no-strings-attached ability to gain resources and extend your plays.
</li><li> Compulsory Evacuation Device lets you return a monster to its owner's hand. No activation requirements means you can pop it at any time to disrupt a combo, and the fact that it doesn't destroy circumvents destruction immunity or effects that trigger on destruction. It's especially punishing for monsters that require investment to bring out, like anything that's summoned from the Extra Deck.
</li><li> The Rank 4 Toolbox strategy qualifies. Fill your deck with only level 4 monsters that can summon themselves or each other, and fill your Extra Deck with only Rank 4 Xyz monsters, with a variety of effects. Any two of you monsters can summon any one of your Xyz monsters, and you can pick whichever one best suits the situation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> 2e, the most cost effective charms are the excellencies — they either add dice, add successes or allow you to re-roll. No flashy attack flurries, no golden beams of magic light.
<ul><li> Oh, it gets even better. Whereas the first few excellencies cost motes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a>) on a per-use basis, several Exalt types have an excellency which allows them to commit motes and then use the earlier excellencies at reduced cost (or no cost at all) for the rest of the scene. End result? Basic multi-action attack flurries boosted by free excellencies are one of the most efficient means of dealing damage in the game.
<ul><li> And then even better: Solars have a Charm which allows Excellencies to not count as Charms. Considering you can only use one Charm per turn without a combo, this allows you to augment your defenses no matter what (even if it cannot be used alongside the cost-reducing Charm above).
</li></ul></li><li> Perfect Defenses. They're cheap, only serve to negate one attack, but they're needed to survive attacks being enhanced by other Boring, but Practical charms.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> has two examples that stand out.
<ul><li> First, there's the medium laser — modest range and damage, but lightweight, compact, heat-efficient and can fire all day long without running out of ammo, which makes it a great weapon for light 'Mechs that can't carry much in the way of weapons tonnage anyway and a great <em>backup</em> weapon for the big guns on heavier designs. It's just perhaps the most ubiquitous 'Mech weapon out there, period.
</li><li> And second, one of the most basic items of the 'modern' era: the double heat sink. It's perfectly boring — all it does is funnel heat (one of the main limiting factors on how many weapons you can safely use in one turn) out of your 'Mech or other eligible unit at twice the rate of the plain old single heat sink for the same one-ton weight. However, because using DHSs on a design also doubles the base heat dissipation capacity it gets for free with its fusion engine <em>before</em> explicitly installing extra sinks and because the game was not originally balanced with this in mind, this item arguably ends up edging right into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> territory; single heat sinks certainly have generally fallen out of favor as a consequence except on units that explicitly cannot use doubles, or for background flavor reasons.
<ul><li> In theory, what's supposed to keep double heat sinks in check is their increased bulk (two or three times the internal space of singles depending on model). What this means in practice is that at the absolute worst they take up a grand 50% more room <em>for the same heat capacity</em> — and further quirks of the construction rules actually leave them frequently the more compact solution after all. (This also applies only to 'Mechs; other units that can use double heat sinks just don't assign space to heat sinks in construction at all and so completely ignore this supposed drawback anyway.)
</li></ul></li><li> When it comes to BattleMechs, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.sarna.net/wiki/Stalker">Stalker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> embraces this trope.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Triad Technologies marketing campaign:</strong> It's not flashy. It's not the cutting edge. It just keeps coming.
</div></li><li> The dodge technique in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PsionicsTheNextStageInHumanEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PsionicsTheNextStageInHumanEvolution">Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution</a></em>. It isn't as flashy as a lot of the other techniques, but it automatically succeeds against attempted TK Grabs and is useful against more mundane attacks as well.
</li><li> A lot of the stuff in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a> is like this. Three thousand years in the future and they are <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">fighting with rifles</a>. Most commerce is carried, not on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starships</a>, but on great big hulking Megacorporate abominations that fly unadventurously on scheduled routes. The Imperium is ruled, not by a mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a>, but by a caste of the decendants of successful industrialists and soldiers. And so on.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trinity">Trinity</a>, Clairvoyants ('Clears') don't get to throw bolts of lightning, conjure fire with their minds or teleport an enemy into a dozen different directions at once. Their 'flashier' abilities (like precognition) are depressingly unreliable. They have one major edge, though: They can easily find out where exactly somebody or something is. Combine that with, for example, some knowledge of ballistics and a mortar and you have a very, very frightening combo.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a>, the core rulebook highlights how every single tradition has developed a simple "heal my injuries" technique. Some magi blast foes with arcane bolts, some call forth ancient spirits, some invent sapient computers, but <em>everybody</em> finds some way to close their wounds quickly.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a> traditional fire arms are still the norm since most people can't afford or acquire advanced RAY weapons.
</li><li> Legacy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>. He rarely attacks and has a very straightforward deck. He's considered one of the best heroes because what his very straightforward deck <em>does</em> is tank damage and heal and buff allies to considerable degrees. Tempest's base power (which deals one point of projectile damage to all opponents) becomes terrifying when he's getting +2 to it from Legacy's ongoing effects and power use, enabling him to sweep, for example, several of Grand Warlord Voss' Gene-Bound troops off the board in one hail of death.
<ul><li> Expatriette is a very straightforward hero to play, and she doesn't have many ways to create wild combinations like, say, the Wraith or Absolute Zero can. However, she also comes online <em>very</em> quickly. Wraith has a higher power ceiling, but to get to it, she needs to build up her gear. Expatriette with her shotgun or assault rifle can start raising hell immediately, and do it fairly effectively.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em>: Major Haley has the Telekinesis ability which enables her to... move an enemy figure two inches and turn it. It sounds like a letdown, compared to the flashy attacks other warcasters get. However, use it on one of the enemy's elite melee infantry and suddenly that unit cannot use combined melee attacks, cannot charge you, is open to be charged from the rear by your melee troops and the enemy's front line suddenly has a huge gaping hole in it, which you, with a bit of luck, can shoot at the enemy's support units through.
</li><li> An in-universe example are the Crab Clan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em>. The Crab don't have the elegance and duelling skill of the Crane, the cunning of the Scorpion or the magical skill of the Phoenix. What they <em>do</em> have is a keen understanding of siege warfare, a healthy dose of blunt pragmatism and a lot of very muscular men with big hammers and axes. On the rare occasions that they're able to dedicate their full resources to fighting other Clans instead of the Shadowlands they tend to win handily.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most characters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon">Impossibly Cool Weapons</a> such as a scythe combined with a sniper rifle, a katana with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableLengthChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableLengthChain">Variable-Length Chain</a> and a gun, and shotgun gauntlets. Jaune Arc's weapon, Crocea Mors, is just a normal sword and shield. But still, they're very durable and dependable, even if they aren't as flashy as the other character's weapons. In Volume 4, he gives Crocea Mors an upgrade that lets him combine the sword and shield into a greatsword, symbolizing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Taking A Level In Badass</a>.
</li><li> While Pyrrha's Miló is a javelin/short sword/hunting rifle, her shield Akoúo̱ is nothing but a small bronze shield. It doesn't even transform into a sheath like Jaune's.
</li><li> Ironwood's weapon of choice is a simple revolver called Due Process. Yep. Only in the deranged world of <em>RWBY</em> would a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a></em> be relatively mundane, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but then Ironwood doesn't <em>need</em> a melee weapon anyway, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">the entire right side of his body is cybernetic</a> and he can casually throw a Beowolf Alpha around like a ragdoll.</span>
</li><li> Maria <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">tells</a> Ruby that she calls her Semblance 'Preflexes'; it's a form of precognition that manifests as her being able to use reflexes just before something happens, rather than relying solely on reflexes in response to something happening. The elite Huntsmen and students have exceptional reflexes anyway; while Preflexes doesn't sound like it offers much extra, Maria cites it as one of the reasons she became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">legendary fighter</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She states that her Semblance and training were more important than the much cooler power of her silver eyes and advises Ruby to develop the same mentality about her own abilities.</span>
</li><li> Semblances are single, unique superpowers every Huntsman has the potential to unlock. Examples include Ruby's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, Glynda's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Telekinesis</a>, Pyrrha's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnetismManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnetismManipulation">Polarity</a>. Semblances are often cool, flashy abilities, but some people have abilities that don't seem as visible or interesting on the surface.
<ul><li> Ren's Semblance is called Tranquility: he can dampen the negative emotions of himself and others. Not only does this allow anyone affected by his Semblance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">act calmly</a> even in stressful situations, but it renders him or others invisible to the Creatures of Grimm, which hunt humans by sensing negative emotions.
</li><li> Hazel's Semblance is called Numbing Agent, and it allows him to ignore pain. That's it. It doesn't give him any actual resistance to damage, but it makes him <em>very</em> hard to take down in a fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It enables him to directly inject <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal">Dust</a> into his body in quantities that are normally too large to handle because his Semblance makes it possible. This allows him to hulk out and supplement his punches with elemental effects such as lightning or fire.</span>
</li><li> Jaune's Semblance is Aura Amplification. He first uses it by accident when Cardin tries to punch him; it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">heals</a> Jaune's injuries and leaves Cardin with a sore fist. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He later learns he can pour his Aura into other people. Not only can this restore their Aura reserves, it amplifies an Aura's natural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and can bring a person back from the brink of death. It also massively boosts a person's Semblance, which is the manifestation of their Aura. Ren can normally only mask the emotions of himself and one other person from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Creatures of Grimm</a> but Jaune boosts him so much he can mask an entire train full of people from the Grimm.</span>

Agent Washington was surrounded by Freelancers with awesome armor enhancements (super speed, active camo, time distortion, and more) and AI to help run them to their fullest. What does Wash have? An assault rifle and a bio-scanner. He refuses to use an AI after a tragic incident with the Epsilon AI, but his name was always in the top ten; once he became the sixth best fighter in the project, he never dropped lower thanks to him being one of the most stable and reliable fighters of them all. Who needs epic gadgets when you can have a guy who won't screw over the mission out of carelessness or pride? It's even reflected by his icon on the leaderboard; Wash is represented not by a unique skill such as sniping (Wyoming) or brute strength (Maine) but by a battle rifle. Any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> fan will recognize the implication: the battle rifle is efficient, reliable, and effective.

Redcloak convinces Xykon to use it against the ghost of Soon Kim, because even though it's a mere 1st-level spell, it does Force damage which ignores the incorporeality of ghosts.
</li><li> Xykon's spellcasting style is all about practicality over flash, at least when he's serious. Up against a wizard with dozens of different types of magic? Why engage in a drawn-out battle of spell and counter-spell when you can just spam Energy Drain until he has no power left, and finish him at your leisure? He may <em>enjoy</em> being stylish and looking cool, but Xykon understands that that has to take a backseat to practicality when the chips are down.

Dale's attempt to get Boomhauer out by swapping clothes with a patient gets him mistaken for one instead, and Boomhauer's later escape plan fails because Bill ratted it out.

<ul><li> Earth ponies as a whole embody this. Their innate magic is a connection with nature, along with higher physical strength and stamina than the other two races. Not flashy like a unicorn's magic or a pegasus' flight, but the series has made it very clear that said connection with nature is the most important trait in a world where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheFrostOnWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheFrostOnWindows">frost is painted on the windows</a>.

Omi (and, by implication, Raimundo and Kimiko) goes through the paces of the test, dodging and weaving through all of the traps. When it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Clay's</a> turn, though, he walks to the starting line, takes a deep breath...and promptly <em>turns around</em>, walks to the back of the course (it's a circle, so the finish line is just behind the start) and picks up the toy. As he points out, Master Fong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">specifically told them</a> to "get the dog"—he <em>didn't</em> say "do the course." This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">was the point of the whole course</a>, and Master Fong praises Clay for solving it. The whole opening thus sets up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">the Aesop</a> for the rest of the episode—staying calm, assessing a situation, and using strategy is better for solving problems than flashy tricks or panicking.
<ul><li> In the same episode, the other monks learn that lesson when rivals Jack Spicer and Wuya recruit "Le Mime," an evil mime with the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginationBasedSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginationBasedSuperpower">create invisible constructs</a> out of whatever he pretends exists. Le Mime traps Raimundo, Kimiko, and Omi in one of his invisible boxes, and all of their brute force and strenght can't set them free...until they realize that since the clown's power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">relies on their imagining what he's mimed</a>, picturing the box as having an openable door immediately lets them out.

Since he's almost impossible to actually hurt, there's no reason for him to do more than the bare minimum in combat unless he's fighting Jack.
</li><li> The beetle drones that Aku uses to subjugate the populace are helpless against stronger resistances to his reign, like Jack or the Scotsman, but given they can handle the majority of the world's populace with ease, there's really no reason to <em>stop</em> using them.
</li><li> Between seasons 4 and 5, Aku decided to stop trying to kill Jack directly and let time take care of his rival by just waiting for him to die of old age. This would have gotten rid of Jack with no effort for Aku, and only failed because of something neither party could foresee.

It's one of the most mundane and simplest forms he's used, but it's deadly effective as he kills nearly everyone save for the 300 warriors (who blocked with their shields) and the Scotsman's daughters, who are protected by the Scotsman's bagpipes.</span>
</li><li> Also in Episode CI, Aku can't decide which elaborately formed blade he wants to use to publicly execute Jack and asks Ashi to do it for him, and ends up lampshading this trope when she forms a simple lance.

It doesn't do anything magical, but remains destructive and dangerous. Later, he learns a proper magic spell, but only the one — and it's Levitato, an extremely basic spell that lifts things off the ground. In contrast with Star's huge and flashy spells, however, Ludo gets very creative and skilled with that one spell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">allowing him to become a much bigger threat with that alone</a>.

Towards the end of the episode, Doug finds out that the Funnie V's simplistic design allows it to perform stunts and all the other kites ended up having flaws that crippled them (such as being too heavy or its dark colors making it hard to find after it crashed).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>: Much of the plot of the series is about Lothal, Ezra's homeworld, being used as a base for production of a new Imperial weapon. It's heavily implied to be the Death Star (or at least part of it), and the heroes skirt the edges of that project several times. But in the end, it's Grand Admiral Thrawn's new TIE Defender—a faster, tougher version of the same basic TIE fighter that the Empire already produces by the millions (it's approximately as superior to Rebel ships as they are to the existing TIE fighters). Furthermore, because Thrawn invests in things like proper production lines and division of labor, when the heroes destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> he loses nothing and can just move forward exactly as planned. In fact, the fighters are so effective compared to cost in the new canon that, combined with the influx of defectors as a result of the Death Star, had the TIE Defender project been funded over the Death Star, the Rebellion likely would have lost.
</li><li> Scrooge McDuck embodies this trope in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Ducktales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Ducktales2017">rebooted DuckTales</a>. In the pilot he plots a course with a submarine that will avoid any threats even if it's not the most direct route, and deduces a way to deal with Atlantean deathtraps that is simple and safe, as opposed to the reckless Dewey who changes the route of the sub to a quick but dangerous one, and blunders <em>through</em> the traps.
<ul><li> Scrooge is this in his business dealings as well; work hard, be smart, stay honest. He rejects Glomgold's elaborate schemes against Mark Beaks because even though they both can't stand him, Scrooge would rather simply ignore him and concentrate on his own success than focus on destroying a rival.
<ul><li> In the third episode Scrooge is seen to do this in a psychological manner. When his Board wants to cut spending and suggests firing some of his employees, Scrooge goes on long impassioned speeches to defend them. This does next to nothing to sway their minds and when one of Gyro's inventions crashes through the wall Scrooge decides to skip the theatrics and essentially scare the Board into dropping the matter by confirming that the ones they want to fire are completely crazy and almost certain to come after them for revenge. That single declaration gets them to quickly decide it's in their best interest to keep Scrooge's workers hired and as far away from them as possible.

But a lot of the ones who come closest to winning are those with pretty straightforward powers, like Vanisher (invisibility), Chameleon (takes the form and abilities of someone else), Troublemaker (intangibility), and Silencer (steals voices- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">more problematic than it sounds</a>, given that the heroes' powers are voice-activated), who were just really good at using them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "Norm Unleashed", Doofenshmirtz is called in for jury duty and leaves his robot Norm in charge of plotting that day's evil scheme to take over the Tri-State Area. Rather than build some over elaborate and easily defeated -Inator like his boss, Norm upgrades himself with a variety of guns, rockets, and other forms of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-lroAtSTgU">weaponry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to take the Tri-State Area by force (and would have succeeded had not Doof mistook his efforts for goofing off, distracting Norm long enough for Perry to get in close and shut him down).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekLowerDecks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekLowerDecks">Star Trek: Lower Decks</a></em>, the USS <em>Cerritos</em> specializes in what's called "Second Contact." It's not as glamorous as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a>, but it's where the important diplomatic work gets done.
</li><li> Most of the 31st-century tech in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> tends toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a>, but the episode "2D Blacktop" has Leela replacing the dangerous Planet Express ship with a safer and more practical model that's treated as the futuristic equivalent of a soccer mom's minivan. It has some nice tech inside (such as a solidifying foamlike spray that can be used to incapacitate anyone who's irritating the driver), but it's essentially a flying gray cube with sliding doors and no windows, making deliveries a lot less exciting.
<div class="indent"><strong>Leela:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorrowedCatchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorrowedCatchphrase">Good news, everyone!</a> Our safe new ship has arrived, and it's gonna knock your socks on, where they belong! Ta-da! <em>(Unveils ship.)</em>

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Leela:</strong> No! That's the ship! The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast.
