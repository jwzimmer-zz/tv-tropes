</p><p>There are some films where they deal with the world repeating over and over, e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em>, the similar film <em>12:01</em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalRecurrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalRecurrence">Eternal Recurrence</a> phenomenon.

If the adults are the main characters and the same thing occurs, this becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a>.
</p><p>Or it can happen in an adult show where the characters have had flashbacks to show some of the older characters' backstories, and then you have an episode that focuses on the younger characters who experienced the same thing.
</p><p>Can also be used just with a character repeating the exact same experience as another character did previously (sometimes in an earlier episode).

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series, according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, is all one timeline with this going on. Mankind keeps making space colonies, having a civil war with them, getting a bit too violent and inventing gundams that are too powerful, and destroying said colonies, forgetting about it, then sending out new colonies, only to have a civil war with <em>them</em>. Then gundams get too powerful... and each time, they progress a little further, with the destruction and casting back of mankind going further each time. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, they're at an early-1900s level of technology. And history repeats again <em>anyway</em>, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>.
<ul><li> This is also specifically the point of the ideological debate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movie</a>, <em>Endless Waltz</em>. The villainess argues that war is an inevitable part of human nature (the titular "endless waltz" of war, peace, and revolution), while the female lead says that lasting peace can happen if people are willing to put forth the effort to end the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycle</a>. Needless to say, at least in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> version of events, she does't succeed in spreading that idea.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em> applies this to the Universal Century in general. Despite all the lofty aspirations made by humanity, from uniting Earth under the Federation to the space colonies and even the Newtype ideal, the same mistakes they've supposedly overcome keep getting repeated...albeit on a much larger scale as shown by the One Year War and subsequent conflicts. Audrey wonders at one point whether an answer to that age-old question even <em>exists.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG">Gundam: Reconguista in G</a></em> meanwhile, taking place in the same timeline as the Universal Century albeit long after the calendar itself was abolished, has the Capital and SU-Cordists <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and their Spacenoid masters</span> attempting to keep the UC's events from happening again. While this has in the process led to mankind becoming reminiscent of the pre-Earth Federation days, it'll all be for naught given that the anime <em>also</em> takes place in the same continuity as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a>.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Lelouch lost his mother to an assassin, which shattered his cozy, comfortable worldview and inspired him to change the world with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremism</a> in order to give his beloved sister a better life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His father the Emperor, who is the biggest obstacle on his quest, went through pretty much the exact same thing in his lifetime and is himself trying to change the world — along with his wife, who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>. You can imagine Lelouch's shock when he learns all this...</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> has an example where Kyoko romantically pursued her teacher, and when Godai gets a teaching job at her old school not only is he also romantically pursed by a student, but the several of the methods used are very similar. (Tagging the teacher with a heart on the back when he's not looking).
</li><li> How about situations where something happens on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> and then something like it happens in the main show? Like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>, when Joe makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gekiganger3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gekiganger3">Gekiganger 3</a></em> and in the same episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jun attempts to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> but survives- then Gai Daigouji gets killed suddenly and pointlessly at the end of the episode.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em>, the fighters (who are reincarnations of the various generals of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>) are destined to fight and die in the same battles, in similar ways.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em>, High Priest Zagato <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fell in love with</span> Emeraude, the Pillar of Cephiro. Zagato's younger (and identical) brother Lantis would also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fall in love with the girl who would become the Pillar, Hikaru</span>. The irony is not lost on either.
</li><li> The Moon and Earth Kingdoms from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> were originally destroyed by Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion's forbidden love. When they are resurrected (as Usagi and Mamoru respectively), they fall in love again and history is doomed to repeat unless they take actions about it. This is taken further in the live action adaptation.
<ul><li> Quite fittingly, in the manga Queen Beryl, responsible for summoning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that destroyed the Silver Millennium, dies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuttedLikeAFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuttedLikeAFish">Gutted Like a Fish</a> by Sailor Venus both in the Silver Millennium and the modern day.
</li></ul></li><li> A recurring motif in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> is how despite thousands of years of supposed progress, the past keeps returning. Indeed, one of the taglines is "In every time, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Discussed by Eren and Armin when Eren sees children who remind him of himself, Armin, and Mikasa, and notes that the kids will probably see what they saw when the Colossal Titan broke the wall. It's then averted, as Armin says that this time there are soldiers on the wall who are ready to fight and that those soldiers are them, and they succeed in stopping the Titan and saving the people inside the wall.
<ul><li> The Season 2 finale has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hannes getting eaten by the very same titan that ate Eren's mother years before, in the same manner, while again Eren and Mikasa are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a>.</span> Eren can only laugh in despair at the cruel irony.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, different regions of Amestris seems to keep experiencing the same series of events throughout the countrys history; a controversial leader gains influence in a region and stokes tensions, which quickly explode due to military incompetence and result in large-casualty military conflicts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This keeps happening because Father and his followers keep arranging for it to happen. Its their way of acquiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">sacrifices</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">the production of Philosopher Stones</a>. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> is to make another bit of history (the destruction of Xerxes in a massive-scale human sacrifice) repeat by using Amestris as a giant transmutation circle.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuriIsMyJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuriIsMyJob">Yuri Is My Job</a></em>: When Hime and Mitsuki are in elementary school, Hime agreed to play alongside Mitsuki in a piano recital, which resulted in students spreading rumors that the very unpopular Mitsuki bullied Hime into doing it. In response, Hime quits the recital to spare Mitsuki, causing Mitsuki to believe that Hime betrayed her, and resulting in their friendship falling apart. Years later, Hime ends up working at the same salon as Mitsuki (whom she doesn't recognize), in which both girls roleplay as students at an all-girl school, with Hime becoming Mitsuki's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">schwester</a>."

There was a civil war between two branches of the royal family not so long ago, and the royal family is genre-savvy enough not to risk a repetition by splitting the family again. This means that all the princesses have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticExtendedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticExtendedMarriage">marry one husband</a>. However, there is the additional problem that their now deceased ex-husband was evil, and they married him against the warnings of Princess Trini. They do not want that one to repeat itself either, but Trini, who was hurt most, is understandably reluctant to marry <em>anyone</em>.

By cooperating with them, the crown can weaken the nobility and the church, forming an absolutist state.

However, none of the attempts to actually depict it ever got off the ground. The 4D War intended by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a> strips never made it fully to print, as he left early. "Gallifrey" was a proposed Sixth Doctor story to be written by Pip and Jane Baker rumoured to destroy the titular planet and shake up the status quo, but it was part of a cancelled season. "Doctor Who: The Last of the Time Lords" was the title for one draft of what eventually became the TV Movie. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a></em> range of BBC Books came closest with a story arc about "The War", a time-active conflict in the future, which was eventually prevented from happening by Gallifrey's premature destruction. In fact, from 1981's <em>4-D War</em> to 2013's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>, no Time War was ever actually depicted, and given the setting of the aforementioned anniversary special, that arguably still remains the case.
</li><li> Series 8 was essentially a variation on this: an elderly Doctor in his fifties, his two first companions being teachers from Coal Hill School (kinda), and a new regeneration cycle were all elements from the very beginning.
</li><li> Another meta-example is the various incarnations of the Doctor in Classic and New Who. The most popular Doctor in their respective eras (Four and Ten) get replaced by the youngest actor to play the role at the time (Five and Eleven) and their replacement is a Doctor designed to hark back to the earlier, darker side of the Doctor; played by an actor who appeared on the show before being cast in the role (Six and Twelve). They are then succeeded by a Doctor who uses a British accent that the Doctor has never used before (Seven, Scottish; and Thirteen, Yorkshire).

Nonsensical storylines, younger, homegrown talent being pushed down the card for older, more recognizable names, a money mark for a boss — those problems were always there, but the fan base didn't take any note of them because the talent was having great matches and doing great segments. The shortcomings weren't as strongly pronounced. Then, due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> of all things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> lost control of the company to Dixie Carter who, evidently having not read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfWCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfWCW">The Death of WCW</a></em>, brought in two of the guys on the cover: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a>.

At least three points in its history, SEGA found itself in a position of dominance. Then, as time goes by, the people at SEGA grow complacent and their quality slips, but it still gets good sales due to brand recognition. People realizing the company's products are becoming shoddy and broken eventually catch up to the company, ruining its reputation, and SEGA is forced to go through major corporate restructuring, only to return back to dominance sometime later. The two cycles most familiar to gamers are the period between the 16-bit era and the Dreamcast, where SEGA had to become a 3rd-party developer; and the period between it becoming 3rd-party and the present. There was also a cycle long before this, between 1971 and 1978, when SEGA suffered this via its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a> division: Because the quality was on par with American and European machines at the time and cost less to buy and to play because they were made domestically, SEGA was <em>the</em> force in Japanese pinball. As time went on though, the machines broke down and no one knew how to repair them with SEGA providing no real support. By 1976, SEGA's pinball sales plummeted and it had to leave the market two years later with thousands of broken, unplayable pinball machines in its wake.

</li><li> The fifth and sixth games invoke this to a degree: in <em>Sister Location</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Circus Baby is revealed to be a product of the Murderer's actions, and the animatronics themselves were going to use the place as a murder house</span>, while in <em>Pizzeria Simulator</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cassette Man deliberately set the pizza place up to lure the killer animatronics in, including the aforementioned Springtrap, then starts his own "accident" to kill them all and free their souls (or in Springtrap's case, give him a taste of Hell).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>, the Klingons make the exact same mistake in the lead-up to the Federation-Klingon War that they made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">the lead-up to the Dominion War</a>. They unilaterally invade the Gorn, insisting that the Gorn have been infiltrated by shapeshifters (unlike with the Cardassians, the Gorn actually <em>have</em> been), and then when the Federation doesn't believe them, instead of trying to back up their claims they withdraw from the Khitomer Accords. And just like with the Dominion, this resulted in a Federation-Klingon War that only weakened the quadrant for the inevitable bigger fish. Once again, the Klingons' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> tendencies play right into the hands of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> adversary.
<ul><li> In-game, <em>this exact scenario</em> repeats itself <em>again</em> on a small scale in the mission "Diplomatic Orders". A Klingon cruiser commander gets information that a Federation diplomat is really an Undine. Does he submit his findings to the Federation? No! He leads a deep-strike into Federation territory to kill the ambassador himself, and instead of coming out firing, he sacrifices the element of surprise to high-handedly demand that the Federation PC hand over the ambassador. The Fed PC reacts surprisingly well to this: instead of just blasting the idiot out of space on sight (remember, the Feds and Klinks have now been at war for four years), he asks to see the Klingon's evidence, and the Klingon instead takes umbrage and attacks, and because he's up against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armored</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> he dies completely pointlessly and Starfleet makes the kill against the Undine.

After the trial and ensuing earthquake, von Karma found the elevator in which Edgeworth senior had passed out, and was shot in the shoulder by Miles, who had fired Yogi's gun in defense of his father.

<ul><li> Hitler just never learned from Napoleon's mistakes when he tried to conquer Russia. The Nazis ended up meeting the same outcome of this attempted invasion as did Napoleon's army.
<ul><li> Before Napoleon, there was Charles XII of Sweden. Starting a land war in Russia is only a good idea if you can keep the supplies flowing, and every time the Russians defeated the invaders by doing the same thing: Salting the fields, torching the harvest, and retreating until the invading army outran their supply lines, which was invariably hastened by the coming of winter.
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, invasions of Russia haven't always been unsuccessful; the Mongols conquered the first Russian state, and the Poles briefly ruled the country, taking advantage of a leadership vacuum, during the Time of Troubles. Similarly Japan decisively beat Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 and Germany was able to impose humiliating terms in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.
</li><li> The 1941 German invasion was also more of a mixed bag compared to Napoleon's one; the Soviets knew they could not simply retreat from their western provinces because of the industries that had been developed in those territories during the intervening years, and fought the Nazis continuously in an attempt to slow them down. The winter ironically <em>helped</em> the Germans because panzers are more maneauverable over frozen lands than muddy ones. The resulting stalemate by the end of the year meant the war would inevitably drag on for several more before the Russians could fully repel the invaders.
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, the worst thing for logistics in Russia actually isn't winter (when most roads are frozen solid and passable for tracked vehicles or all terrain trucks) but "Rasputitsya" or "mud season" during Spring and Autumn when all roads turn to, well, mud making them virtually impassable.

</li><li> In 1904, Japan started a war with Russia by launching a surprise attack on Russia's naval facilities in Port Arthur, without issuing a declaration of war. Almost forty years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Japan would attack the naval base at Pearl Harbor without issuing a declaration of war first</a>.

</li><li> Some historical and philosophical schools follow this line of thought, in contrast to those stating the case for some form of progress.
<ul><li> Giambattista Vico argued that human history moves through cycles flowing from a Theocratic Age (where religion is an active presence in society and politics) to an Aristocratic Age (where kingdoms are an active presence in society and politics) to a Democratic Age, before returning back to Chaos. He noted that the main reason history repeats is because people refuse to consider how different the past is from the present, unironically accepting Roman civilization as an inspiration while ignoring all its flaws and defects.
</li><li> The other school of thought that came in the 20th Century is the "longue durée" and the overlapping but separate discipline of structuralism which argues that history is not actually made by "great men" and great events but underlying structures and environmental factors. History seems to repeat when we focus on individual cycles of Kings and Wars because the structures in which they operate only allow a few set of scenarios to play out. Real non-repeating history happens when that structure is changed and altered forcefully.
</li><li> The school of traditionalism states the same as they adopt the cyclical view of Hinduism. Sometimes, this is seen as a form of war of forces behind the scenes and all possible Ages are basically one side of this war gaining the upper hand.
</li></ul></li><li> In a strange way, all six of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>'s wives fall into this category:
<ul><li> <strong>Divorced:</strong> Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves were the only two wives who had titles of their own anyway, and both eventually died of cancer. Also, they lived to the oldest ages out of the six; Catherine was 50, and Anne was 41 when they died.
</li><li> <strong>Beheaded:</strong> Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were cousins who both lost their lives on adultery and treason charges.
</li><li> <strong>Died/Survived:</strong> Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr, respectively. Jane was Queen for over a year before she died from puerperal fever, and Catherine only survived Henry for over a year before she too died from the same fever. It's even stranger when you realise that their children did not live to adulthood; Edward VI died in his teens, and it is generally agreed that Mary Seymour did not live past the age of two.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1972, Benjamin Bradlee was the editor-in-chief of <em>The Washington Post</em>, and oversaw the investigative reporting by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein into the Watergate burglary, triggering the biggest scandal in American history. Thirty years later, his son, Ben Bradlee Jr., was an editor at <em>The Boston Globe</em> and oversaw the investigation into another major American scandal: that of sexual abuse by the Catholic Church. Both stories got film adaptations, too: Watergate got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllThePresidentsMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllThePresidentsMen">All the President's Men</a></em>, and the Catholic sex abuse scandal got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spotlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spotlight">Spotlight</a></em>.

Many of the revolutionaries were looking back at recent French history, and the sequence of events involved: To begin with, an all-powerful King. An attempt is made to limit his power but this gets radicalised to the extent that they commit regicide and proclaim a republic. The republic is unable to settle on a stable system of government until a leading military figure stages a coup and seizes power. After initial success, this regime also collapses and the monarchy is restored. The new king rules with success but is succeeded by a brother who badly mishandles his inheritance, which was the situation in 1830. The solution, the revolutionaries decided, was to overthrow the new king and replace him with another from a cadet branch of the royal family. Why? Well, at least in part, because this was what the English had done in 1688, at the end of exactly the same sequence of events.

Thomas would be a controversial pick from the start due to his conservative political views, and would become even more controversial after being accused of sexual misconduct by a coworker. However, the accusations would end up falling flat outside of liberal circles due to a perceived lack of sufficient evidence, and with public opinion on Thomas side, several Democratic senators would break from their party to confirm him. Thus, he would end up becoming a Supreme Court justice anyways after a narrow 52-48 vote. Despite this, the fiasco surrounding Thomas would put a big dent in President Bush's reputation, with critics viewing him as apathetic at best towards women's rights and and the GOP suffering a major defeat in the next election, with Bush himself losing his bed for re-election.

Public opinion would lean against Kavanaugh this time, as it was even before the allegations popped up, but he also had a much more favorable Senate in his corner, with small but unified GOP lean, and Kavanaugh would end up becoming a Supreme Court justice anyways after a narrow 50-48 vote. Despite this, the fiasco surrounding Kavanaugh would put a big dent in President Trump's reputation, with critics viewing him as apathetic at best towards women's rights and the GOP suffering a major defeat in the next election, losing the House of Representatives and inadvertently aiding in his 2019 impeachment, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">this was subverted somewhat</a> in the Senate, with the Republicans getting a net gain of 2 seats due to the fact that Democrats were defending a large number of seats in red states that year. Furthering the similarity, Thomas' accuser openly compared her situation to that of Kavanaugh's accuser in a 2018 op-ed.
</li><li> Both the Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184-205 and the Taiping Rebellion of 1850-64 were incredibly bloody Chinese civil wars started by disgruntled young intellectuals who became religious cult leaders after failing their civil service exams and lead to the fall of corrupt and decadent imperial dynasties (in the case of the Taiping Rebellion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">for the very last time</a>). The current Chinese government's viciously aggressive, often outright genocidal attitude toward religious minorities and political dissidents is at least partly due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> about this.
