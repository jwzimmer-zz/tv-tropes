"Ow, my back!" Bob exclaims. "The pain is immeasurable! I'll sue you! I'll sue!"
</p><p>Someone  usually a stranger, sometimes a friend, occasionally an enemy  has decided to sue Alice in the wake of some minor accident. The plaintiff suffered no real injury, but is suing out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">greed</a>, a desire for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">is simply desperate for justice</a></em>, often with the help of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceChaser">Ambulance Chaser</a> or otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a>.

</p><p>The classic sitcom lawsuit is almost always a tort action: the plaintiff is claiming the defendant's negligence harmed them in some way, and is demanding monetary compensation. The actual injury sustained is always minuscule and the amount of damages claimed has to be at least five times what the hero earns in a year. The complaint itself is often just plain silly, such as suing Pizza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Subnormality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Subnormality">Building</a> because the X-Treme Meatsa-Treatsaria did not truly deliver "gut-busting meat flavor" as promised.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0y94v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0y94v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0y94v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"The meat flavor left my gut <em>completely intact</em>, your honor!"</span>

Within the legal system, calling an action frivolous is like calling the lawyer who brought it a certified loon, the legal equivalent of "not even wrong". Much more common are frivolous claims in otherwise reasonable lawsuits and frivolous courtroom motions that only serve to prolong the legal process and harass participants. Another common instance is the lawsuit that, while it is <em>technically</em> not frivolous because it is based on actionable legal fact, said actionable legal fact <em>is</em> hair-splitting, petty, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a> (e.g. a ten million dollar suit filed against a restaurant for not putting ketchup on a burger advertised as having ketchup on it — it <em>is</em> technically false advertising<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ebjw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ebjw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ebjw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In which the product you describe must accurately fit the product you sell, unless adequately disclaimed or clearly exaggerated</span> and therefore legally factual and actionable,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2dy7w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2dy7w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2dy7w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It is also theoretically actionable under sales law, which is somewhat different from the false advertising laws; note that because the sale of a hamburger is a sale of goods and the purchaser of the hamburger is the end user (rather than a commercial reseller), the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_tender_rule">perfect tender rule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> applies: if the seller's product diverges one iota from what the buyer can reasonably expect based on the seller's representations, the buyer is entitled to damages and to return the product. That said, you <em>do</em> have to return it in salable condition, i.e. intact, not with bites taken out, so this is purely theoretical unless you open your burger before eating it and also are enough of a dick to sue when you find no ketchup instead of going up to the counter and just asking for it. Even then, the seller will be able to argue — possibly successfully — that because you <em>touched</em> the burger you got whatever bugs or dirt you may have had on your hands on the burger, therefore making the sandwich no longer fit for resale and thus denying you that remedy. Additionally, although (again) you are technically entitled to damages, you are limited to the value of the burger as if it had been as warranted (which would be the amount you paid for it, at most) minus the value as delivered (without ketchup, so at much a few cents lower — ketchup is cheap), making it impossible to recover very much — less than the cost of filing a lawsuit in the first place.</span> but is the lack of a free packet of ketchup you could apply yourself worth ten million dollars?).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The majority of the truly outrageous examples you might have heard of are filed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">pro se</a></em>, without an attorney. That's because none want to touch the craziness with a ten-foot pole. If there's an actual attorney involved who isn't also their own client<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3d64k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3d64k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3d64k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"A man who is his own attorney has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">A Fool for a Client</a>."</span> the case might not be so frivolous as it first appears. This is particularly common in personal injury, where "only paid if you win" is the standard; the prospect of eating the cost of an unsuccessful case forces attorneys to be very selective about the cases they take, ergo they're not going to take something unless they have very good reason to believe that it will be determined in their favor.
</p><p>Finally, yet another common lawsuit confused with the Frivolous Lawsuit that may or may not be <em>technically</em> frivolous is the SLAPP — <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation">Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, used to censor or intimidate people into withdrawing truthful accusations/statements, not releasing proof of corruption/wrongdoing, or otherwise silencing people. The Church of Scientology is <em>absolutely notorious</em> for this practice (to the point that almost all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">parodies of it</a> include it), and it's often a favored tactic of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> and the occasional celebrity caught in major wrongdoing, where it may overlap with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">Streisand Effect</a>.
</p><p>Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) or its equivalent in a court system that has one, anyone signing a paper to be filed in court is representing to the court that they have made "an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances...." Violation of Rule 11(b) can lead to sanctions, either upon motion by the other party or on the court's own initiative.
</p><p>In real life, actual frivolous lawsuits will be over long before they get near an actual jury. Repeated filing of frivolous lawsuits, frivolous claims, and frivolous motions will often be met with "contempt of court" charges. Moreover, attorneys have been disbarred for excessive frivolous filings (granted, it takes a <em>long</em> history of accepting worthless cases, making pointless and abusive appeals, and generally pissing everyone off to make them even consider it; bar associations are fairly reluctant to go that far and will <em>never</em> jump straight to disbarment before making use of letters of reprimand, sanctions, and suspensions first).
</p><p>Likewise, litigants known for repeatedly bringing them can be labeled by the courts as "vexatious" and enjoined from ever filing another without getting court approval first (like disbarment, you <em>really</em> have to fuck up before they'll even consider labeling you as vexatious due to a general reluctance to keep someone from having their day in court. It takes a whole lot of abusive, ridiculous claims, worthless appeals, bad courtroom behavior, unpaid fines, and general egregious misbehavior to get them to even think about forcing you to permanently leave them alone). Even if none of this happens, the case (and others like it) can be banned from itself ever being filed again, at least in both the US and Japanese court systems, if it is summarily dismissed with prejudice<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4xjad');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4xjad" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4xjad');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dismissal "with prejudice" simply means that as a matter of law, what you say in your complaint can't actually be used as the basis of a lawsuit. This is the usual way in which many lawsuits end for entirely non-frivolous reasons: if you're trying out a legitimate but untested legal theory, or if it turns out that the defendants have a defense of which you were unaware or which you were aware but weren't counting on the judge buying so quickly, your case will be dismissed with prejudice and there's no shame in it.</span> which may or may not go as far as the judge calling it frivolous, but is a strong warning to the parties and lawyers involved that trying it or a similar case again <em>will</em> put them at risk of the more severe consequences such as contempt charges, disbarring for attorneys involved, and the like.
</p><p>Note that Frivolous Lawsuits are the menace of those countries and judicial systems which follow the common law or which follow the judicial sources literally. They are less an issue in those countries which follow the civil law, such as Romano-German judicial system. In several countries, the judge can dismiss a lawsuit completely if he or she sees it as a pointless, frivolous or as an attempt to abuse the judicial system. This is known in the Romano-German system as <em>prohibition of vexatious litigation</em>: law may not be used to cause harm to someone. Abuse of legal rights was prohibited already in the 1734 law in Sweden.
</p><p>Often this trope is invoked to make an argument about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TortReform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TortReform">Tort Reform</a>, i.e. limiting the ability to file claims or capping the liable amount of damages. On the one hand, everyone can agree that there sure seem to be a lot of unnecessary cases brought to court, which takes up both time and money that can be better spent. On the other hand, it's hard to argue that the mere fact that someone with an illegitimate claim asks for a ludicrous amount of money means that someone with a legitimate claim should have their legal recourse limited. Particularly since — in the United States at least — most defendants in tort cases insist on a jury trial, and the <em>jury</em> is responsible both for determining fault and deciding the amount of damages to award (if any). Furthermore, many 'outrageous' jury awards are reduced following the inevitable appeal, and highball demands are usually more of a bargaining tactic than anything - they're not expecting that to be the actual award, they're just starting extremely high so that they can negotiate down to the ballpark of what they actually want.

This is so large that it exceeds what Scrooge, who at one point had three cubic money bins each over 20 stories tall, expected to make <em>over his lifetime</em>. Scrooge himself is portrayed in many stories as being <em>the richest person in the world</em>, which makes the amount appear even more ludicrous.
</li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> comic featured a character apparently known as Lawsuit Joe, who makes a living by throwing himself in the path of slow-moving cars and suing the drivers.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>. After Peter Parker is bitten and receives his powers, he begins to stand up for himself more, eventually refusing to take crap from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> Flash Thompson. Flash responds by challenging Peter to a fight and, not knowing his own strength, Peter easily breaks his hand. Flash's family demand the Parkers pay his medical bills for the incident or they'll sue, ignoring the fact that Flash had been beating up Peter for years and he was the one who instigated the fight.
<ul><li> For added bitterness, earlier in the volume, the spider bite made Peter ill enough to go to a hospital, and Oscorp wound up sending the Parkers a gift basket and footed the bill out of fear that they'd sue the company. Uncle Ben later explains he knew it was an accident and Peter wound up fine a few days later, so he'd never consider suing.
</li><li> Later still, Norman Osborn, once he discovers what the spider bite did to Peter, toys with the idea of suing his family. His reasoning: The spider was Oscorp property, along with everything the spider produced. Peter has the spider's venom in his blood. Ergo, Peter has stolen Oscorp property.
</li></ul></li><li> One issue of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> had a man intentionally get rear-ended by Veronica so he could sue her.

He does this in spite of the fact that no surviving records say which nations those evil traders actually <em>came</em> from, and that all of this happened 400 years before North America was even <em>discovered</em> by the Europeans. The man's argument rests on how America is a melting pot of nations, and therefore the logic is that <em>some</em> of the people who settled it early on <em>might</em> have come from the unknown nations which looted his country all those centuries ago.

This in tun serves as a flimsy excuse for the nation's democratically-elected leader to whip his people into a frenzy and become a militant dictator, the island becomes a member of the Communist nations... and then when the island turns on its Chinese allies for not helping with the reparations, the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union also turn their backs on the island. The island's head diplomat announces his nation irrevocably severs their ties to the U.N., and then gets promptly arrested by the New York Police Department, since he's been wearing real <em>severed human heads</em> to the last few meetings he's attended.

</li><li> Played with a bit on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>. After Bud and Kelly get into a fender bender with a Mercedes, Al bemoans society's litigiousness. But when Bud tells Al that the other guy was at fault, he immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">decides to sue</a>, and has the children play up the severity (read: existence) of their injuries in court. And just to drive home the ridiculousness of the whole thing, it's mentioned in court that they're suing for "a jillion dollars."
<ul><li> In another episode, a burglar broke into the Bundy family home while Al was asleep on the couch. As Al woke up, he accidentally touched the burglar on the behind, before realizing what was going on and pummeling the burglar. He was later sued by the burglar for "sexual harassment" and being unable to "work", claiming that Al's punch ruined his career as a burglar, greatly exaggerating his injuries, this along with obvious signs that the burglar's attorney was having a relationship with the judge, and even tried to shake Al's hand with the one in said sling after he won. However, Al got the last laugh when he decked the burglar again, and won a Frivolous Lawsuit of his own by claiming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou">he hurt his hand on the burglar's face</a>.
</li><li> In another episode, a thief entered the shoe store where Al works and Jefferson suggested Al could sue the mall for four million dollars, claiming the incident made him afraid of shoes. The mall sent an investigator who kept an eye on Al. To make matters worse, Al's bowling team were finalists in a tournament and the bowling hall wouldn't let him play barefoot because the last one to do so there sued the place for three million dollars. Eventually, Al decided <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">the championship was more important than money</a></span>.
</li><li> In another episode, Peggy sees a TV ad about a lawyer who helped a woman to get 2.5 million dollars from her husband for asking her to cook. Peggy tries it with Al by volunteering to cook but Al is so focused on some idea he refuses the offer and the lawsuit idea goes unmentioned for the rest of the episode.
</li><li> Jefferson once fell inside Al's workplace when a wall gave in. Jefferson's claims of injury ended as soon as Al stated they had no insurance.

In <em>The Trial of Henry Blake</em>, Henry has to defend himself against gurney races, and Radar selling shoes and other things. General Steele brings in several charges against Hawkeye, including impersonating a civilian (<em>The General Flipped at Dawn</em>). In <em>The Novocaine Mutiny</em>, Frank charges Hawkeye with mutiny for disobeying some idiotic orders. In all cases, all the charges are dropped.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7479m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7479m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7479m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The US Army permits defying orders that are idiotic, in violation of the Geneva Conventions, or otherwise objectionable—but the soldier had better be ready to defend his actions at the inquiry afterwards.</span>
<ul><li> Oddly, in <em>M*A*S*H</em>, the episodes containing legal issues only come about when key characters usually aren't guilty. For example, when Hawkeye is tried for mutiny, it's a case where he was doing what was best for the patients. He's never tried for the many mutinies he actually commits or the times he fails to obey lawful orders.
</li><li> Along the same lines, Radar has a run-in (pun intended) with an elderly Korean man known as "Whiplash Wang". He lost his farm because of the war, so now he fakes traffic accidents and demands money from the military drivers. The situation is played for laughs, but the motivation certainly is not.

The suit ends up being thrown out when the defense points out that Albert is a trained paratrooper (thus having knowledge of how to fall without injuring himself) and that he has "accidentally" fallen down pub cellars numerous times in the past, and taken the settlements.

If he was only in the presence of his neighbor because his wife asked him to, say, pick up groceries or trim the hedges, he will sue her for putting him in a dangerous position. The number of lawsuits Steve filed over the course of the show are innumerable, and every one as inane as the last.

Every time, he wound up humiliated due to Kramer acting stupid and ignoring his legal advice.
<ul><li> In "The Postponement", Kramer sues a coffee chain for burning himself with hot coffee. In the next episode "The Maestro", we meet Jackie Chiles for the first time as Kramer settles the case for free coffee for life, passing up a large cash award in his stupidity.

Jackie Chiles' remark that a bra has to fit "like a glove" is a reference to the O.J. Simpson trial. Kramer's stupidity was again the cause of losing this case, since Jackie had it in the bag when he insisted on checking to see if the bra would fit her.
</li><li> In another episode, Kramer turns his apartment into a cigar bar/smoking room, and the cumulative effects of hours upon hours of concentrated smoke make his skin pallid. They sue the tobacco companies and settle for making Kramer the new Marlboro Man.

That dress-dyer doesn't fit in a cell, so a shorter dress-dyer is hauled in, and he can't come up with an excuse to get out. The focus, incidentally, is not on the burglar, but on how <em>crazy</em> the judge authorizing it all is.
<ul><li> A variation exists where the last man recommends to hang the thief, the thief is too tall to <strong>hang</strong>, so a shorter man is brought. The man recommends to dig a hole below the thief's feet. The thief urges them to hurry so that he'll be able to get to heaven soon because a king is needed there...

Randall then begins a concerted campaign of harassment until the lawyer finally gives in and agrees to take on the case- against Dante, since he was the store manager at the time.

Mr. Burns accidentally hits Bart with his limo; the family attorney 'tricks' Homer into exaggerating the resulting injuries to squeeze more money from Burns.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lionel Hutz</strong>: Doctor, are you sure there isn't a little soft tissue trauma in the facial area? <br/><strong>Dr. Nick</strong>: Oh yeah, tons of it! <em>[wrapping Bart's head with bandages]</em> Just say when!
</div><ul><li> The irony being they would have gotten something, at least covering Bart's hospital bill as Marge wanted, if they had just told the truth at trial rather than make up false claims. Or if Homer had just taken the half-million Burns had offered him and went home - they ended up with nothing because Homer was greedy.

If they kick Homer out before he has had '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffetBuffoonery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffetBuffoonery">all he can eat,</a>' does this make it fraudulent publicity?
<ul><li> He stays hours past closing time (he was kicked out because the personnel wanted to go home), forces them to make runs to the grocery store, and eats far more than any thoughtful person would (he emptied the restaurant's entire food stock <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">several times over</a></strong>). 'All you can eat' does not mean 'you can/have to eat it all.' This one ends up getting settled out-of-court; they invite him back, but set Homer up in a glass display and let all the people gawk at him pigging out. It draws boatloads of customers who came to watch, who then decide to try the food — because this restaurant <em>has</em> to be pretty good if he's eating like that.

Bart is an unemployed loser who frequently files these to make a quick buck, but it's deconstructed in that <em>none</em> of his ridiculous cases (among them: suing a restaurant for an over-salted french fry, Disneyland for a spider bite received on the premises, and a messenger company for refusing to pay him for his first two weeks of employment) ever goes to court, and it's implied Bart can't find a lawyer to take them all.

While Plankton is faking the injuries he claims to have received from slipping on the wet floor of the Krusty Krab, he really <em>did</em> slip on said floor, and there was no "Wet Floor" sign to warn him of the hazard because Mr. Krabs was too cheap to buy one (something the jury acknowledges in its verdict). Plankton <em>would</em>, therefore, have a legitimate case... if not for the fact that he was only there to commit a felony (i.e. stealing the Krabby Patty formula).

It turns out that Dale built the railing himself—without a permit, makes his own poison (he's an exterminator), is his own boss, and made up a fake liability insurance carrier just to shut Hank up. Lucky's lawyer tries to sue Strickland Propane because Hank suggested that Dale hire Lucky.
<ul><li> Lucky later manages to turn this around. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After the lawyer refuses to drop the case due to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">malpractice reasons</a>", Lucky fakes a video of him playing golf, thus making his suit void. The lawyer tried to "unfake" it to get the suit through, but Lucky manages to get "injured" again in the lawyer's office.

</li></ul></li><li> In another episode, Dale sues the tobacco companies, lying to claim that years of secondhand smoke have made his wife unattractive and destroyed his marriage. When he discovers that the company has (electronic) bugs planted in his house, he tries to exploit it by insulting Nancy at every opportunity, which completely destroys her self-esteem and nearly <em>does</em> destroy their marriage (he didn't tell Nancy what he was doing because she's a bad actress). When Dale finally figures out what he's doing, he cross-examines <em>himself</em> and convinces everyone that he still finds Nancy gorgeous.

Whether the Devil has sufficient minimum contacts with Pennsylvania, or whether it would be reasonable and fair for Pennsylvania to exercise personal jurisdiction over a resident of Hell, a foreign country, is left as an exercise for the reader. Also left as an exercise to the reader is whether the Devil has sovereign immunity as the ruler of Hell.</span> While not binding precedent in Pennsylvania, being a New Hampshire case, the record of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilAndDanielWebster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilAndDanielWebster">Stone v.

Once he trademarked a word or phrase, he immediately launched million-dollar lawsuits against people and companies who were casually using those words. His lawsuits have consistently been laughed out of court.

It was finally settled once and for all after roughly four years. He lost, but not before making the life of the laundromat owners thoroughly miserable, even after they made repeated offers to settle for $3000, $4600, and $12000. He's also no longer a judge, thanks in part to this suit.
</li><li> In 2010 San Diego patent lawyer Matthew Pequignot noticed that the patent markings on his Solo cup had expired several years earlier. In response, he sued the company for <em>11 trillion dollars</em> (over 80% of America's national debt) on behalf of the U.S. government, and would've been eligible to receive half of the fine. He lost the case due to being unable to prove that the company intended to deceive the public, and the company claims they didn't immediately replace the molds because each one costs half a million dollars.
</li><li> Valery Fabrikant is a man who walked into Concordia University in Montreal and shot many of his colleagues in 1992. During his life sentence he's become famous for filing these. So many that in 2000, the Quebec Superior Court declared him a vexatious litigant (meaning he needs the approval of a judge to take any legal proceedings against someone else). A bid to clear that status was dismissed by the Court in 2007.

<ul><li> Cast members were filming a training film at Disneyland on what to do if there's been an accident. As soon as the actor fell down, a lawyer appeared from among the bystanders encouraging the "injured" man to sue Disneyland and continued to do so <em>after they walked past the camera</em>.
</li><li> At Disneyland, a guest jumped out of his Skyway cabin in an attempt to injure himself and sue the park. Originally claiming that the door on the cabin was faulty and that he fell out, the court became suspicious of the fact that the man conveniently landed in the only tree below the ride that could have broken his fall and saved his life. Although he continued on with his story, after the cabin door was inspected and revealed to be in working order the guest admitted that he had jumped out of the attraction and was goaded into filing a lawsuit by his family. Nevertheless, the park removed the Skyway shortly after the lawsuit was dismissed in case someone decided to try it again.
</li><li> A humorous example is someone claiming that one of the three little pigs sexually harassed her and caused her to gain weight. She was laughed out of court because the costumes were shown as having inoperable stub-arms.

According to the tale, a woman sued Disney, claiming eardrum damage from the pressure change during her rapid descent in the Hydrolator. Disneys lawyers transported the judge and jury to Epcot, took them into the Hydrolator, and operated it with both doors open to establish that there was no actual descent (the hydrolators were stationary elevators that only moved a few feet to simulate a descent to the bottom of the ocean), and the judge dismissed the case on the spot.

</li><li> "Dr." Tim Langdell, CEO of Edge Games, claims to own the video game trademark for the word "Edge." The man hasn't made a video game since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, but whenever a video game with the word "Edge" in its name is announced, he jumps on the developer and publisher with a trademark infringement lawsuit.

</li><li> Westboro Baptist Church does this to its critics. Its most often-used defense is that its right to free speech is being violated. These are the people who picket military funerals because they see the deaths of soldiers as divine punishment for serving a country that tolerates gay people. They even picketed Heath Ledger's funeral. Why? For <em>playing the role of a gay cowboy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></em>. The general opinion of many people (even in the American Civil Liberties Union) is that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">doing it for money</a>. One theory is that they are deliberately antagonizing people so that they will be assaulted, only to sue for damages, since their protests are, well, deliberately antagonizing, but always in public places where they can legally sue anyone who attacks them over it.
<ul><li> Fred Phelps, Sr. (the leader of this church until his death in 2014) was an attorney until he filed a frivolous lawsuit of his own against a court reporter, which ultimately led to his disbarment. The suit was because the court reporter had not given him a report on time as he had asked. He sued her for $22,000. The thing that got him disbarred was the fact that he falsified eight sworn statements which he claimed to have obtained, but he had never contacted any of the people.
</li><li> Another suit that Fred filed was a $50 million class action lawsuit against Sears for being a few days late delivering a TV. 6 years later they settled out of court for $126.

Although Trump provided testimony to prove his net worth did indeed exceed $7 billion, it was thrown out by the judge, who claimed OBrien committed no "actual malice" and that Trump could not confirm his true, definite net worth.
</li><li> A class action lawsuit was brought against Apple in 2009 because some older iTunes gift cards advertised that "songs are 99 cents", only for the actual prices to be raised to $1.29.
</li><li> In an instance nicely averted by a cry of "Have your attorney talk to <em>my</em> attorney", self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne threatened to sue Robert Lancaster, manager of <a class="urllink" href="http://stopsylvia.com">a website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> devoted to debunking Browne's claims. Her — or her lawyers' — <a class="urllink" href="http://stopsylvia.com/articles/browne_attempttosilence.shtml">argument<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was that by (back then) calling his site "Stop Sylvia Browne", Lancaster was <em>infringing Browne's trademark</em>: his use of her name, the claim went, "misleads the consumer as to the source or affiliation". They were arguing that someone reading his site, on which nearly every word <em>criticized</em> Sylvia Browne, might mistake it for Browne's own website. Mr. Lancaster had his own lawyers <a class="urllink" href="http://stopsylvia.com/articles/response_attempttosilence.shtml">reply<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to this blatant attempt at a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation">SLAPP<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; Ms. Browne's lawyers have not to date followed up.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman">David Letterman</a> left NBC for CBS, NBC threatened to sue him if he used intellectual property from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LateNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LateNight">Late Night</a></em> such as "Stupid Pet Tricks" and the Top Ten list. The problems with this include top ten lists preceding Letterman's show, and the fact that Stupid Pet Tricks actually came from a show which Letterman legally owned the intellectual property of. When both Letterman and Jay Leno mocked them for it, the issue was dropped.
</li><li> Orly Taitz filed numerous lawsuits throughout the presidency of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>, all claiming that Obama was not a US citizen and therefore ineligible to be President. These lawsuits kept being tossed out of court left, right and center. Taitz was eventually fined $20,000 essentially for wasting the court's time, and it gave her a public perception of being completely barking mad. Even so, she kept right on filing them. She has only been granted a hearing once in 2012, to challenge the Georgia primary. Obama - named as the defendant - did not even send a lawyer to contest it. Taitz's testimony clearly only worsened the judge's opinion, as he still ruled against her. The Drudge Report described the hearing as "Empty Table 1, Orly Taitz 0".
<ul><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RealTimeWithBillMaher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RealTimeWithBillMaher">Real Time with Bill Maher</a></em>, Maher offered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> one million dollars to release his birth certificate to prove he was not the lovechild of an orangutan, parodying a similar offer Trump had made to President Obama during the birther debacle. Much to everyone's surprise, Trump not only complied, but had his lawyer send a threatening letter to Maher demanding the promised money on penalty of legal action. It never went to court since, as Maher himself put it, jokes made by a comedian on a late night talk show do not constitute a legal contract.
</li></ul></li><li> Congressman Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking member on the US House Intelligence committee, has gotten a reputation for being quite litigious over silly matters. He filed a libel lawsuit against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> and a random Republican strategist for <em>$250 million </em> in March 2019 for the former allowing two parody accounts of him, one of his cow (his family are dairy farmers) and one of his mom whos his campaign manager. The latter is for her making fun of him on the platform. He also sued the parent company of his hometown paper,"The Fresno Bee", for $150 million for mentioning his name in an article about a vineyard he and his siblings own a minority stake in getting sued for sexual harassment because a woman working an event for them on a yacht claimed it was a cocaine-fueled orgy with underage prostitutes. They never claimed he knew about it or that he was involved. Hes also suing a writer for Esquire and the magazines parent company for $75 million for publishing a story about his familys dairy farm in Iowa using undocumented workers.
</li><li> In March 2020, Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) had her $50 million first amendment lawsuit against Google tossed for its frivolousness. During her brief presidential run the previous year, Google temporarily suspended her advertising account due to suspicious activity but after finding nothing nefarious, quickly reinstated it. Gabbard claimed this was an attack on her free speech. The judge who dismissed the case noted that since Google is not a government entity, its not bound to the first amendment and is free to moderate its content as it sees fit. Right-wing media company Prager-U had a similar lawsuit against Google subsidiary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> tossed right around the same time.
</li><li> Universal Studios once tried to sue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and several other companies selling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> merchandise over allegations that it infringed on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong">King Kong</a></em> copyright. What makes this frivolous is that not only was King Kong a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainCharacter">Public Domain Character</a>, but Universal <em>themselves</em> had proven he was such in an earlier lawsuit. Furthermore, the judge ruled that even if there had been a copyright, Universal still wouldn't have had a case, saying that, at best, Donkey Kong was a parody of King Kong. Needless to say, they lost, and were forced to pay back every bit of money they had gotten plus damages. Nintendo was so grateful to the lawyer who defended them in the lawsuit that they gave him exclusive rights to name his yachts "Donkey Kong" and later named a successful video game franchise after him. The lawyer's name was John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a>. To make it even sweeter, Nintendo later (successfully) sued Universal for their King Kong video game, which was itself a blatant ripoff of Donkey Kong.

</li><li> There are a couple of lawsuits pending against Casey Anthony, the Florida woman who was tried and acquitted of murdering her daughter, but one complaint filed in October of 2012 was pretty absurd. A Pennsylvania woman sought <em>$3 billion</em> in damages for psychological and emotional distress, claiming that Anthony was a member of the Illuminati who told the plaintiff that she would poison her water and that the plaintiff had secret cameras lodged behind her eyes watching her every move. (A full copy of the complaint <a class="urllink" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/casey-anthony-3-billion-lawsuit-sued-83205/">can be found here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) The lawsuit was thrown out before a judge could even consider it.
</li><li> Singer Lady Miss Kier of the former group Deee-Lite (of "Groove Is In The Heart" fame) sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a>, claiming that popular space reporter Ulala of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceChannel5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceChannel5">Space Channel 5</a></em> dance game series was created based on her likeness. She promptly lost the lawsuit, as Sega claimed that the creators of Ulala did not even know who Lady Miss Kier or Deee-Lite were when they created her.
</li><li> Monster Cable Products is probably one of the most infamous repeat offenders of this trope. For a time in the 2000s, they aggressively claimed to own the trademark on the word "Monster" and frequently threatened to sue (and occasionally filed lawsuits against) anyone who used the word "Monster" to sell anything. Monster Energy Drink, Disney (for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>), Monster Mini Golf, Monster.com, the Chicago Bears (for calling themselves "The Monsters of the Midway"), and the Boston Red Sox (for the Green Monster at their home stadium Fenway Park) were all pressured by the company. The suits all ultimately went nowhere, since Monster Cable's trademarks only extend to audio equipment - such as cables, speakers and headphones.

Diddy himself is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in hip hop, and at the time of the suit he was worth only about half a billion.

Most of them receive "<a class="urllink" href="http://mattwpbs.com/2009/08/10/i-refer-you-to-the-reply-given-in-arkell-vs-pressdram-1971">the reply given in Arkell v. Pressdram<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". In one example, the owners of <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> threatened to sue over a spoof <em>Telegraph</em> front page treating their own financial arrangements like the MP expenses scandal the paper broke. The <em>Eye</em> pointed out that this was clearly in the "joke" section of the magazine, and could no more be mistaken for a real <em>Telegraph</em> headline than <em>The New Coalition Academy</em> could be mistaken for a real school newsletter. <em>Allegedly</em>, it is considered a mark of seniority amongst the relevant section of the English Bar, much like the first time one buys a round for their old man, or first drives a car, to have represented Pressdram Inc. (the <em>Eye</em>'s publisher) in a court case. Of course, this may simply be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a>-ery of <em>Private Eye</em> as a maniacal offending machine.

Most notably, among his targets were two videos on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ThatGuyWithTheGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ThatGuyWithTheGlasses">That Guy with the Glasses</a> (one was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a>'s review of the film), whose massive fanbase put Wiseau on the end of a counterattack of epic proportions. They eventually got him to back down, and the reviews are now back up.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdackF2H7Qc">famous Pepsi ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed a series of goodies a kid could get for turning in Pepsi points, culminating in a kid landing a Harrier jet at his school with the caption "7,000,000 POINTS." Then 21-year-old John Leonard actually tried to purchase a Harrier with a $700,000 check at ten cents a Pepsi Point, and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_v._Pepsico,_Inc">sued Pepsi when they refused to take it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Among other things, Leonard demanded a jury composed of "The Pepsi Generation" to hear his claim. The obvious comedic tone of the commercial, the ridiculousness of expecting a school to accommodate individuals arriving via jet, and the fact that $700,000 nowhere near covered the $24 million required to purchase an AV-8B Harrier II all worked against Leonard. The judge quickly threw the case out; in the ruling, the judge noted that any reasonable person would understand that the Harrier offer was a joke. Although just to be safe, Pepsi began airing an updated version of the commercial which increased the Harrier's cost to 700,000,000 Pepsi points.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1054pp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1054pp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1054pp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That would be $70 million in cash, which <em>would</em> have covered the cost of a Harrier - almost three of them, in fact. But that's assuming the USA's Department of Defense would willingly part with a working military-grade fighter jet for a civilian contest, and there's no way they'd ever do that.</span> This also made any company who used a similar gag in their marketing start including some "prize not actually available" legalese.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken">Al Franken</a> was sued by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">Fox News Channel</a> for his book <em>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</em> for using Fox News's motto: "Fair and Balanced". The judge heard both sides' arguments and told them he needed a moment to consider. He stepped out of the courtroom for two seconds before returning and saying, "Your (Fox's) claim is completely without merit, both legally and factually."
</li><li> In 2017, comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnOliver">John Oliver</a> was planning to do a story about coal mining on his satirical news show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a></em>. Mining company Murray Energy got wind of this, and sent Oliver a letter preemptively threatening to sue him if he mentioned the company or their CEO Bob Murray in any way. That would be a clear violation of Oliver's First Amendment rights, given that nothing he was planning to say was libelous. In all likelihood, Murray Energy was hoping to intimidate Oliver into silence with the prospect of a long and costly trial, given that Murray has a history of sending such letters to anyone he thinks will criticize him or his company. Oliver did his story on coal mining anyway, now with special focus on Murray Energy, including directly attacking Bob Murray personally several times, ultimately resulting in John Oliver saying "Eat shit, Bob" on-air. The promised lawsuit predictably came and just as quickly fizzled out, but Murray kept filing for appeals or re-filing the original case for almost <em>three years</em>, all the way to the West Virginia Supreme Court, with the suits only ending because Murray Energy went bankrupt and restructured. It caused HBO's insurance to triple in cost, but did allow John Oliver to discuss SLAPP laws, ending that segment with a huge musical number to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">once again tell Bob Murray to "Eat shit, Bob"</a>.
</li><li> In the year 2014, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a> sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RockstarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RockstarGames">Rockstar Games</a> over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>, accusing the company of basing the in-game celebrity Lacey Jonas and the blonde, bikini-clad girl in the game's merchandising materials on her likeness without her permission. The case was thrown out by the judge, as the character's appearance was actually based on that of the fashion model Shelby Welinder, and it was found that Rockstar had absolutely no contact with her whatsoever.
<ul><li> Similarly, in 2018, after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em>, Pinkerton Consulting &amp; Investigation, which still exists as a subsidiary of the Swedish security company Securitas AB, sued Rockstar for royalties due to the portrayal of Pinkertons as antagonists in the game. Take-Two, Rockstar's parent company, successfully counter-sued, arguing that the Pinkertons are such a staple of fiction set in that period that their portrayal should count as fair use and/or public domain, and Pinkerton's case was dismissed.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Babylonian</a> Code of Hammurabi, if no evidence could be found to support a claim or the plaintiff was found to be using false witness, the plaintiff could be <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">executed</a></strong>. Bear in mind the Code wasn't a codified set of laws (it was only used as a basis for later systems of law after Hammurabi's reign), so much as a list of legal decisions Hammurabi had made in the past, meaning he <em>actually had put at least one person to death for a frivolous lawsuit.</em>
</li><li> Häagen-Dazs, an American ice cream company who designed their name to sound Scandinavian, once brought the American ice cream company Frusen Glädjé (whose name means "Frozen Joy" in Swedish if you remove the accent that was put there to help Americans pronounce it right) to court. Why? Because the Häagen-Dazs people considered it false advertising that Frusen Glädjé were using a Scandinavian-sounding name despite being American. Since Häagen-Dazs were doing the exact same thing with their name (which actually sounds German to most Scandinavians), the court found that by virtue of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclean_hands">unclean hands doctrine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (you cannot sue someone else for doing something when you yourself are doing the exact same thing), Häagen-Dazs was barred from suing Frusen Glädjé or indeed anyone else over using faux-Scandinavian names to market ice cream. If you're wondering who <em>could</em> bring such a suit: Only an actual Scandinavian company marketing ice cream with a "We're Scandinavian!" schtick would have grounds, but even then they wouldn't be particularly likely to prevail.
</li><li> Scenario: You're attending a prestigious university for free because your father is a professor there. You don't attend/participate in class. You get a C+, and as a result you don't get the career you wanted. Logical solution: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2277651/Woman-27-sues-Lehigh-University-1-3-million-C-got-2009.html#axzz2KiLnEhRT">Sue the university for 1.3 million dollars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, accusing your professor of sexual discrimination.

</li><li> In December 2012, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> filed a lawsuit against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Level5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Level5">Level-5</a> for 900 million yen (US $11 million) alleging that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> infringes on 2 of Sega's patents by using drag-and-drop and tap commands on a touchscreen to control multiple characters at once, i.e. using the Nintendo DS touchscreen <em>as a freaking touchscreen</em>. In quite possibly the most epic beatdown ever to happen via corporate public statement, Level-5 <a class="urllink" href="http://www.level5.co.jp/news/20121212/popup.html">responded<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by calmly pointing out that Sega's 2 patents in question are dated 2009 and 2011, whereas <em>Inazuma Eleven</em> was released in <strong>2008</strong>, then proceeding to basically call out Sega for patent trolling.
</li><li> Bluehole, the publisher of Battle Royale video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlayerunknownsBattlegrounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlayerunknownsBattlegrounds">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a></em>, first threatened a lawsuit in September 2017 against Epic Games' competing title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a></em>. What made it frivolous was that <em>PUBG</em> did not invent the Batte Royale genre of video games, <em>Fortnite</em> used distinct assets and mechanics to create its own Battle Royale mode instead of copying from <em>PUBG</em>, and that the Unreal engine that powers <em>PUBG</em> is owned by Epic, effectively meaning Bluehole were biting the hand that fed them. By the end of June 2018, however, it was reported that Bluehole withdrew their case, although no explanation was given as to why. The rumor is that Bluehole were envious of <em>Fortnite</em>'s success and popularity, which quickly overshadowed them despite them being first to popularize Battle Royale games.
</li><li> The <em>Russian government</em> did this in 2012, believe it or not, suing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> for "propagandizing homosexual behavior" during a concert, in a hearing that bordered on the absurd. During the hearing, the prosecutor - who sought $10.7 million - claimed that the singer's so-called "propaganda of perversion" would negatively affect Russia's birthrate and erode the nation's defense capability by depriving the country of future soldiers. The judge almost had to tell court reporters to leave because they were laughing so much, and he eventually threw the case out. As you might expect, Madonna neither attended the hearing nor commented on the result.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oatmeal_and_FunnyJunk_legal_dispute">FunnyJunk vs. The Oatmeal.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In short:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOatmeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOatmeal">The Oatmeal</a> creator Matthew Inman found out FunnyJunk reposted his comics without permission, and posted an annoyed rant about it on his website. Lawyer Charles Carreon, hired by FunnyJunk, claimed Inman's post constituted defamation of their website and demanded $20,000 in damages. Instead, Inman started an Indiegogo campaign to raise $20,000 for the National Wildlife Foundation and the American Cancer Society—and raised over ten times that. Carreon then sued Inman, Indiegogo, the American Cancer Society, <em>the NWF and a hundred anonymous Internet users,</em> claiming they <em>might</em> commit charity fraud. FunnyJunk dropped their lawsuit after Inman proved he donated the Indiegogo money to charity.
</li><li> After that, Charles Carreon <em>lost it,</em> and began suing everyone under the sun. When he tried to sue a satire site for libel, he managed to make himself a public figure, thus protecting the site under parody laws. His wife invoked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Godwin's Law</a> on critics, and ultimately Carreon had to pay $46,100 to the satire site.
</li></ul></li><li> Jesse Dimmick, who was running from a murder charge in Colorado, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/29/jessie-dimmick-is-suing-h_n_1119317.html">sued a couple he took hostage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Kansas for breach of contract after they broke their promise to hide him from the police. Thankfully the ridiculous lawsuit was dismissed and <a class="urllink" href="http://cjonline.com/news/2013-06-06/dimmick-sentenced-37-years-colorado-murder">Dimmick was sentenced<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to 11 years for the kidnapping and 37 years for second-degree murder.
</li><li> In Italian law, <em>every</em> lawsuit must go to a judge before being possibly dismissed, with <em>no punishment whatsoever for it</em>. Thus Italian courts have an enormous backlog for things like a woman suing her daughter in law for not following the family (of the mother in law) recipe for a particular dish, or a stupid crook getting sued for attempting a bank robbery by the same people who foiled and beat him up.
</li><li> The infamous "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants">Superheated McDonald's Coffee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" suit, often held high up as the epitome of this, is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a>. The facts of the case are more complicated than most stories mentioning it indicate, but the gist is that the lawsuit was not simply over coffee being hot, but rather being so hot that it's impossible to drink it (they were found to be a good twenty to thirty degrees higher than any other fast-food restaurant that serves coffee; Liebeck ended up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">her thighs, buttocks, and genitalia melting and fusing together</a> from the heat), meaning McDonald's should have had no business selling coffee at said temperature. The vast majority of the award was also <em>punitive</em> damages imposed by the jury after finding McDonald's knew this but chose not to do anything about it, even though statistics showed a disproportionate number of people who bought McDonald's coffee got burns - in short, it was the company's disregard for safety that ultimately led to them losing.
</li><li> Similar to Ms. Liebeck's ordeal, Charles Bigbee suing a telephone company after being hit by a drunk driver while inside a phone booth is an infamous aversion of this. As it turns out, Bigbee (who became permanently disabled and lost a leg as a result of the accident) did start with the logical step of suing the driver, but only got a pittance because somehow the driver was never tested for alcohol after the accident and thus there was no proof she was drunk at the time. Bigbee then discovered that the phone booth in question had already been hit and replaced multiple times (it was very close to a busy intersection) and yet the phone company never moved the booth, added guardrails, or even fixed the booth so that the doors wouldn't suddenly jam, which is what prevented Bigby from escaping. Bigbee pretty much had to sue to the phone company to get the money he needed to afford medical care as well as deal with the reduced employment opportunities from his new condition. This misunderstood case <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY6ANtiPrlY">serves as a prelude<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Swindled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Swindled">Swindled</a></em>'s episode on the McDonald's coffee lawsuit.

Despite the questionable legality of the suit (BSkyB isn't in the cloud storage business and has no plans to enter it; furthermore, they only operate within the UK, Germany and Italy), Microsoft ended up having to change the name of their service to OneDrive to shut them up. As it turns out, they apparently hold the copyright (or at least believe they do) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope">over the very word "sky"</a>, as they also took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelloGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelloGames">Hello Games</a> to court over the name of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em>, a case which took three years to settle.

A video of this was then published on the MLB's website, and the Internet, being the Internet, began making fun of him for it. The man decided to sue the MLB and ESPN over this, apparently believing they are the ones throwing the insults around.

So, yes, she essentially told HR that she wouldn't be able to work if she were hired. She promptly sued the clinic for religious discrimination, and the suit was dismissed a year later.

One is a viking strategy-RPG with a lot of blood and pillaging, the other is a casual game of clicking on glittering candies. Also, the word "saga" actually means a "viking heroic story", much more befitting a game about vikings. Still, the makers of Candy Crush Saga basically believe they own the words "candy" and "saga", and sue anyone who uses them even in completely unrelated games.

</li></ul></li><li> Filing too many of these was what led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> from independent game developer studio Digital Homicide. James and Robert Romine, the two brothers who ran the company, engaged in such blatant abuse of the legal system that it drove them into bankruptcy. As a result of the costs of filing, all of their lawsuits being thrown out, and the extremely negative press they received, Digital Homicide had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">closed its doors</a> by the end of 2017.
<ul><li> In early 2016, James Romine filed a lawsuit against video game journalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition">Jim Sterling</a>. For some time, Sterling had been covering Digital Homicide by critiquing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware">asset-flipped games</a> and reporting on their assorted underhanded activities. Romine sued Sterling for $10.7 million, charging that anything Sterling had ever said or written about them was libel. The crux of the lawsuit was an article Sterling published where he alleged a game's artwork had been stolen when it had been legally purchased - Sterling had already noted this, and corrected his article. In fact, Sterling had corrected it so quickly, Romine had to cite <em>Sterling's own retraction</em> to prove it even happened. Romine ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">representing himself since no lawyer would take the case</a> and made his own documents for submission to the court (resulting in nigh incomprehensible legal documents), and Romine also demanded Sterling compensate him for the time he spent researching law <em>so he could file the lawsuit in the first place.</em> The case was eventually dropped in 2017 when Sterling's lawyer drilled into Romine's head how deeply and utterly screwed that Digital Homicide would be if the case ever saw the inside of a courtroom.

The Romines demanded $18 million compensation for criminal destruction of property because the defendants left negative reviews and comments on their games. The prayer of relief demanded any defendant who couldn't pay have their Steam accounts permanently closed as recompense. When Valve found out about the lawsuit, they immediately shut down Digital Homicide's account and purged all of their games from the Steam storefront.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13alq8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13alq8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13alq8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Digital Homicide then tried to sue Valve for breach of contract, but that lawsuit didn't go anywhere, either.</span> On top of that, most of the legalese was so vague and broad that the range of defendants could have encompassed anyone that is currently working in, has ever worked in, and ever will work in the video game industry, including content creators on YouTube. A judge threw the case out before it got anywhere near a courtroom.
</li></ul></li><li> Red Bull once settled a class-action lawsuit out of court. According to Benjamin Careathers, the man who led the charge in filing suit, "consumers of the drink did not benefit from any mental or physical enhancements, though the product states in its advertisement that it 'gives you wings'." In other words, they sued Red Bull because it doesn't actually make you grow wings when you drink it. And this is ignoring the line "actually, Red Bull [does what energy drinks are supposed to do]" that shows up in their advertisements, which could be construed as a disclaimer.

The woman ignored the lawsuit - since it was obviously frivolous and would never stand up in court - and the neighbor <em>won the suit by default</em> because she didn't respond. Now she's at risk of losing her home and it's going to take some <em>serious</em> legal fees for lawyers to overturn the lawsuit<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note146339');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note146339" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note146339');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The actual default can be waived pretty easily - all that you have to do is file a motion to set aside a default judgment, and if the motion isn't obviously frivolous, the court will usually grant it. It's drafting the motion that can be costly - while motions themselves are almost always copied with minor alterations, Mad Libs-style, from a preexisting template, few laypeople have access to law books or other sources of those templates and have to rely on attorneys to do it for them. A motion written by an ordinary citizen will likely lack crucial elements and be thrown out.</span>. However, courts can set aside default judgments for good cause shown and upon such terms as the court deems just.

(D. Colo. Mar. 2, 2009): A company that produced prefabricated steel buildings was investigated by California and Colorado authorities for deceptive sales practices (the buildings were fine, but the company misrepresented some important characteristics) under their respective states' consumer protection laws after receiving complaints from dissatisfied customers; these authorities sue.

The funny thing is that because the conspiracy laws are so complicated, this technically <em>wasn't</em> a frivolous suit—it's too hard to prove that they didn't have a chance. That said, when the judge in the case brought by the Colorado authorities made his ruling, he said it was "obvious" that the company had violated the law—something judges don't say lightly when there's parallel litigation on the issue, basically amounting to saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldSayItBut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldSayItBut">I could say that the other suit is frivolous</a>, but I won't because that wouldn't be <em>quite</em> right."

Sylvia Ann Driskell, a woman claiming to be an "Ambassador of God", did not seek any monetary payment, but wanted the courts to determine whether or not homosexuality was a sin. She cited no laws in her petition, which was handwritten on notebook paper, riddled with spelling and grammar errors. The only evidence Driskell cited for her claim was a series of Bible verses.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16974z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16974z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16974z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even if she did cite a law, the US Supreme Court struck down all anti-sodomy bans in 2003, which would override any cited laws.</span> In other words, Driskell's petition was a seven-page homophobic rant, and she wanted the courts to prove homosexuality was a sin. The case was quickly dismissed on the grounds that there was no demand for relief, no particularized injury, no specifically identified defendant (citing Mayo vs. Satan, listed above), and that the court has no interest or authority in engaging in such theological debate (and to add salt to the wound, some commentators theorized that Driskell was also mentally ill in addition to being extreme in her views). To add insult to more insult, the official record of the case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic">retains all the spelling and grammar errors in the letter</a>.

She then begins sending attorneys to the bakery, apparently oblivious to the reason why they all immediately drop her case against the bakery, and ends up going through <em>four</em> of them, probably wasting thousands or even millions of dollars in the process, before she gives up (or, less charitably but more likely, before she gets enough of a bad rep amongst attorneys that they won't take her case, goes pro se, and winds up being declared a vexatious litigant).

Eric Hoffman's lawyer subsequently relieved himself of his duty because continuing to represent someone for a case that was now obviously frivolous would be a serious ethics violation, and Eric dropped the case immediately after.
</li><li> Frivolous lawsuits involving taking advantage of generosity have become a problem in China, in which people who injure themselves in public, if someone helps them, either sues the person who helped them, accusing them of hurting them in the first place, in hopes of getting money; or will milk their hospital stay for as long as they can and send the bill to the person who helped them. It's gotten to where shipping company Alibaba has created "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-good-samaritans-20151020-story.html">Good Samaritan insurance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>," where someone who's covered, if they're struck by a situation like this, will receive legal assistance from Alibaba to fight back.

</li><li> Anas Osama Ibrahim Abdin, the creator of unreleased video game <em>Tardigrades</em>, sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>'s Ripper arc, on the basis that both involved giant tardigrades travelling in space. Both the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and the Second Circuit <a class="urllink" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/cbs-beats-copyright-claims-over-star-trek-discovery">told Abdin to pound sand<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the basis that both were based on tardigrades being able to survive in space, a scientific fact that it would set a horrible precedent to copyright, any elements that could be copyrighted weren't substantially similar, the characters weren't similar enough to be comparable, the story of <em>Tardigrades</em> wasn't developed enough to compare to <em>Discovery</em>, and the rest was stock sci-fi concepts that could never be copyrighted.
</li><li> In 2007, cartoonist / toy inventor Troy Walker tried to sue Viacom, claiming that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> was copied from his 1991 failed toy / comic strip <em>Bob Spongee</em>. The lawsuit was laughed out of court, with the judge reminding Troy that the origins of <em>SpongeBob</em> go back to 1989, almost <em>2 years</em> prior to <em>Bob Spongee</em>.
</li><li> The estate of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> are suing the studios that made and released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnolaHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnolaHolmes">Enola Holmes</a></em> due to claiming a copyright on Sherlock Holmes <em>emotions</em> that hasn't lapsed yet, never mind that many previous films gave Holmes emotions without being sued, as did the very first Holmes novel (which is already in public domain).
