<ul><li> A hacker who broke into the Solomon mainframe is held captive in their HQ as their tech-guy. (It should be noted that this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,72515-0.html">has happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">the real world</a>.)

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>: The Time-Space Administration Bureau has a track record of giving defeated opponents job offers as an alternative to prison time. The jobs are often active-duty combat positions where crooks may wind up facing universe-destroying Lost Logia or armies of cyborg super soldiers and the like, but many are also basically community service roles working for civilian organizations like the Saint Church. In contrast to many similar arrangements, the ex-convicts enjoy, take pride in and do well in their jobs, and their superiors, for the most part, trust them completely. (It helps that much of the time, the crimes in question involved duress or deception, and that Nanoha is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">skilled at befriending them</a>.) At least <em>15</em> characters have gone through this program by the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">StrikerS</a></em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fyjq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fyjq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fyjq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fate, Arf, Hayate, Signum, Vita, Shamal, Zafira, Cinque, Sein, Otto, Nove, Deici, Weindi, Deed, and Agito.</span>
</li><li> The manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SukebanDeka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SukebanDeka">Sukeban Deka</a></em> and its anime and live action incarnations revolve around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">delinquent Japanese schoolgirl</a> fighting crime.
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mugai-Ryu</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em> are all death row criminals who are buying back their lives by collecting Itto-Ryu heads.
</li><li> Lind L. Tailor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is set to impersonate L on a broadcast to try to see how Kira will kill him on the day of his execution. Later on, L proposes having a criminal write names in the Death Note and see if he dies 13 days later to determine whether the 13-day rule is fake, and pardoning the criminal if he or she survived, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but gets killed before he can enact the plan</span>.
<ul><li> Aiber also counts, at least in the manga, where he mentions in passing that L has enough evidence on him to get him life in prison, and he likes the chance to use his con artist skills.
</li></ul></li><li> The main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CyberCityOedo808" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CyberCityOedo808">Cyber City Oedo 808</a></em> involves taking three criminals with life sentences, putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash">explosive collars</a> on them and sending them out to stop other criminals. If they succeed in their missions, they get time removed from their sentences (though all three have sentences of over 200 years, and one of them was once penalized with extra time for disobeying orders during a mission). Their goal is to eventually work off their entire prison sentence, though they hadn't come close yet by the end of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingOfThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingOfThorn">King of Thorn</a></em> manga, the government recruits a hacker this way. The fact that he wants to take revenge on the infiltrated facility's system administrator certainly helps.
</li><li> Argo Gulski in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em>, a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirate</a>, was caught and imprisoned by Neo Russia, who gave him the ultimatum of fighting as the country's Gundam Fighter for the freedom of his crew, or live-imprisonment for the lot of them. As an added bonus, he has an explosive charge permanently attached to his chest, making escape for him totally impossible.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, we have the Shichibukai: seven infamous pirates given pardons by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">the World Government</a> in return for their service, which is spent crushing revolutions or related regime change or dealing with other pirates. While they're often derided as "Government Dogs", many of them actually have no compassion for the World Government; at least two members outright hate it, and all of them are insanely powerful, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">calling them that within earshot</a> is not a good idea. There's only one member who seems truly loyal to World Government, that being Bartholomew Kuma, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">but that's another story...</a>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Hellhole Prison</a> of Impel Down is home to Shiryuu of the Rain, a former Head Jailer whose habit of killing his charges landed him on death row in the deepest levels of the hellish prison. During a unprecedentedly massive prison riot, he's released to help control it, his sentence postponed for the duration of this second chance. Unfortunately for the staff of Impel Down, his cooperation lasts only until he regains his sword, after which he proceeds to make things much worse by cutting through the guards and communication system <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before escaping with Blackbeard</span>.
</li><li> A humorous example is Curly Dadan, head of a bandit gang. Vice-Admiral Garp is willing to overlook her crimes, but only on the condition that she looks after Portgas D. Ace, and later Monkey D. Luffy. While Dadan does grow attached to the D. brothers, she considers the hardships from <em>raising</em> them to be worse than any prison sentence.
</li><li> Interesting example with Oimo and Kashi, giants who were part of a very powerful and dangerous pirate crew. A century before the story began, the group was forced to disband when their co-captains Dorry and Brogy got into an argument and began a fight to the death on a certain island to show who was right. Fifty years later, neither of the captains had come back to their home island of Elbaf, so Oimo and Kashi set sail back to the island where they were fighting, but were captured by Marines along the way. They were told that their captains had been captured and imprisoned, but a bargain was made with them: if they would work for the World Government for a hundred years (since giants live to be 300), all four of them could go free. They agreed but the World Government lied to them. And not about setting them free when their time was up: for the fifty years that the two of them had waited on Elbaf, and another fifty after that while they worked for the government, their captains were still fighting on that island, over 73,000 duels that all ended in draws. And the Straw Hat Pirates happened to visit that island on their journey, and then they came to where the giants were guarding the gate. When Usopp persuades them to tell their story (after the others had beaten them), he tells them the truth. It takes some time to convince them that they've been betrayed, but Usopp knows so much about Dorry and Brogy and was so emotional about how their valor had inspired him that Oimo and Kashi finally believed him. Cue a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Oimo</strong>: You bastards
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kashi</strong>: How dare you
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Both</strong>: LIE TO US?!

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ryoko returns to protect Kyon from Kuyoh, and appears in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment to fight Kuyoh in a Knife Battle, making the scene where she tries to kill Kyon a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> scene.</span>

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em> manga, Nao joins Haruka's Ori-Hime unit so that her rule-breaking will be ignored. Mai questions whether Haruka will keep that promise.

Each one has been labeled and branded by a symbol marking their specific "Sin." Each one is then given the chance to atone for their crimes by serving the great kingdom of Liones. They became heroes and answerable to the King himself alone.
<ul><li> Meliodas the Dragon's Sin of Wrath, the captain, and once in a moment of pure rage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroyed an entire country that he was meant to protect after a powerful villain kills the woman he loved</span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted; nobody knows where the country went, but Melodias was simply too angry at the death of a DIFFERENT woman to focus on saving it from being teleported to "somewhere else".

</li></ul></li><li> Diane, the Serpent's Sin of Envy, is a 30ft tall giantess and accused of being envious of humans she was hired to help and betrayed them before being captured. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In truth, she was the one betrayed and she killed the humans who were near her in retribution</span>.
</li><li> Ban, the Fox's Sin of Greed, is an immortal thief who became that way after slaying the Holy Guardian of the Fairy Forest and drinking the elixir of eternal life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In truth, he and the guardian fell in love with each other. He only drank the elixir of immortality after a giant demon attacked, fatally wounding both of them and Elaine, the guardian, takes the elixir and gives it to him by one last kiss</span>.

In truth, Gowther and Nadja fell in love, but Nadja had a weak heart. After consummating their love for the first time, her heart finally gave out but she died happy. The naive Gowther, not understanding when Nadja told him they had similar hearts (kind and loving), takes out his own magic heart his maker created for him, and tried to bring her back to life by inserting it into her chest</span>. Guards arrive at the scene with Gowther covered in the woman's blood and her chest ripped open.
</li><li> Merlin the Boar's Sin of Gluttony is for having one hell of a royal claim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Heaven or Hell, take your pick</span> yet still demanding EVEN MORE TEST SUBJECTS.
</li><li> Escanor the Lion's Sin of Pride, is a pariah for having freakishly superhuman strength that fluctuates depending on the time of day (he's a total wimp at night). He broke his brother's arm with one hand as a 3-year old, and his kingdom has feared him ever since.

However, Uranai Baba is capable of resurrecting the dead for one day, so Freeza could participate on their team. Freeza agrees after learning that if he doesn't, all of Universe 7 will be erased, Hell included, which would end his existence forever. The same will hold true if Universe 7 loses, so it isn't in Freeza's interest to betray the team either. He does demand that, if they win, they will resurrect him fully with the Dragon Balls. It's unclear whether Goku truly intended to keep that promise, but in the end Whis does resurrect him as a reward for helping Universe 7 win.</span>

The only exception is Sabertooth, who is there by his own free will, as he simply enjoys killing.
</li></ul></li><li> The '80s version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em> featured an assortment of supervillains sent on black-ops missions by the government in exchange for pardons. 'Suicide Squad' became a very appropriate name due to the nature of their missions and the penalty for refusing to go on them in the first place. This version was featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Task Force X</a>" (in the comics that's the government's official but seldom-used name for the Squad) in the episode of the same name.

<ul><li> A later reinvention has the new recruits coming directly from The Raft a.k.a. Alcatraz for supervillains. This team was created in the hopes of eventually reforming the supervillains. With some already-reformed villains in leadership positions because they're more likely to know when a recruit's faking it.
</li></ul></li><li> Another team of Marvel villains like this was the Freedom Force; technically, this was what Mystique's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants became after they offered their services to Valerie Cooper in exchange for pardons from the government. They were able to do a few good deeds (most notably apprehending Magneto) but after a few unpopular incidents like trying to enforce the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Mutant Registration Act</a>, which brought them into conflict with the X-Men and X-Factor, the team fell apart. Especially damaging was that they made a very violent attempt to take down the X-Men in San Francisco, where contrary to the usual "hated and feared by those they protect" situation the X-Men were well-liked by the locals and on good terms with the police...who arrested Freedom Force instead. And Mystique had to go along with that because they were nominally the good guys now. (Cooper decided to hire X-Factor to replace them.)
</li><li> Magik was given this status following the events of the <em>Schism</em>, selected by Cyclops to be a member of the "Extinction Team." There wasn't an offer for release or parole with it — she was only let out of the X-Brig for missions, and her suit had a lethal fail-safe to prevent her from teleporting away. This relaxation of her sentence seemed to have both positive and negative impacts; after gaining new powers from the Phoenix Force, she escaped, purged the Juggernaut's powers from her brother permanently and she remains a supporter of Cyclops and his revolutionary X-Men. (Unfortunately, this didn't help her and Colossus reconcile; it actually made their relationship worse than ever, as he figured out she could have done that at any time and made him keep the Juggernaut powers to teach him a lesson. He has since said that he actually wants to see her <em>dead</em>.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> series <em>Hunter's Hellcats</em> had a very similar premise to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarrisonsGorillas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarrisonsGorillas">Garrison's Gorillas</a></em> (see below).

</li><li> The Nick Spencer run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a></em> uses a humorous but semi-realistic version of this to explain why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateRobotZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateRobotZombie">gay android supervillain</a> Machinesmith is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyinFlorida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyinFlorida">working a dead end job in Miami</a>.

</li><li> In the 60s, the British comic <em>Valiant</em> carried a strip called "The Steel Claw" about a rogue scientist who had discovered the secret of invisibility which unfortunately also sent him mad, to the extent that he stole a nuclear weapon and attempted to destroy New York. Upon capture by the British "Shadow Squad" (a fictionalized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MI5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MI5">MI-5</a>) he was given the "offer he could not refuse"; become a secret agent or spend the rest of his life in a cage, where his invisibility would be useless.

If they survive, proving it's safe for the rest of the Ark to return to Earth, they'll all be pardoned for their crimes. Criminals were chosen for the job because it's a death sentence: few expect them to survive on the radiation-soaked Earth, and the real motivation for the mission is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdEquation">conserve the Ark's limited oxygen supply by thinning the population</a>.

Like regular mid-late-war Assault units Penal Battalion infantry are armed with semiautomatic SVT-40 rifles to make them more effective against infantry than basic Conscripts, may be upgraded to use a flamethrower to further their infantry effectiveness and add a lot more against buildings, and use a long-fused and expensive Satchel Charge ability which will dish out a lot of damage against buildings and most armored vehicles hit or simply obliterate all other things caught in the blast. However, unlike actual Assault units every man has his own SVT-40. The rifle was a specialist weapon typically reserved for sharpshooters and snipers, and wasn't usually issued to other troops until the mid-late war period.
<ul><li> Being so well armed is not wholly unrealistic. Each Front (up to 200,000 combat troops) was authorised to maintain one Penal Battalion (up to 1000 combat troops) composed of disgraced soldiers. Within these, they were authorised to field a company (up to 200 men) composed of nothing but disgraced NCOs and Officers. These former military men could be reasonably expected to have the training and intelligence necessary to care for and make good use of such valuable weapons. These specialist units should be distinguished form the one that each Army (up to 100,000 combat troops) was authorised to maintain, which were not always composed of former soldiers and had no all-NCO/Officer companies. Despite the in-game units' equipment suggesting that they are an elite unit fielded at <em>Front</em> level, their voice acting hints is more indicative of an ordinary unit at <em>Army</em> level.

<ul><li> The "Class-D Personnel" are convicted criminals sentenced either to life or execution. Unlike most boxed crooks these guys aren't likely to be granted freedom after their missions — they're used exclusively as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">expendable manpower in dangerous research</a>. Any that survive the assorted testing are <em>terminated</em> at the end of the month.

Anyone guilty of infiltrating the Foundation to steal anomalous items, or doing/suggesting something overly inhumane to an anomaly will be arrested and sentenced to D-class.

SCP-1983 was an anomalous abandoned house of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">The Heartless</a>, aggressive shadow creatures that ripped the hearts out of the living and could only be killed by silver bullets. D-14134 was sent in on a tether with a camera to scout it after the loss of an entire recon team inside, but the tether snapped and he was lost. Several hours later, SCP-1983 vanished, leaving the scout team's desiccated remains and an informal SCP report written by an agent in the anomaly. It is believed that D-14134, in the manner of some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> video game character, found the notes and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">fought his way through the house and somehow destroyed their nest</a></em>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: each Red Army <em>Front</em> (up to 200,000 combat troops) and <em>Army</em> (up to 100,000 combat troops) was authorised to form one Penal Battalion (<em>Shtrafbaty</em>, up to 1000 combat troops) composed of disgraced soldiers. <em>Front</em>-level <em>Shtrafbaty</em> were authorised to contain up to a company (up to 200 men) of former Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers. <em>Army</em>-level <em>Shtrafbaty</em> could contain convicted criminals straight from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">The Gulag</a>. People deported to internal exile as colonists in Siberia, and their children, were recruited into special combat divisions (of up to 10,000 men) instead and did not serve in <em>Shtrafbaty</em>. Service in a <em>Shtrafbaty</em> only lasted up to 3 months, but the Red Army as a whole lost 100% of its prewar combat forces as dead or captured (capture meaning death due to starvation or overwork as slave labour) within the first four months of the war, lost a further 100% in the following year, and a final 100% in the remaining three years. Service in a mid-late war <em>Shtrafbaty</em> was survivable, though not necessarily likely, but service in an early-war <em>Shtrafbaty</em> was almost certainly not. That said, a handful of the more than 30,000 men who served in early-war units managed to survive the near-complete loss of their entire company (up to 200 men) up to three times and earn their freedom... to serve in regular Red Army units, where survival was still far from guaranteed but actually a realistic possibility.
</li><li> On the opposite side was the Dirlewanger Brigade, a unit of former criminals used for anti-partisan warfare whose conduct was so brutal even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">SS commanders wanted it disbanded</a>. Originally only consisting of poachers who had useful stalking and woodcraft skills, eventually more serious crimes and even the criminally insane were allowed to join. The regular army also had the <em>Strafbattalions</em>, consisting of both court-martialed soldiers and civilian criminals.
</li><li> When General Orde Wingate told Field Marshal Slim of his idea for a Special Forces Unit to harrass the Japanese in the rear, Slim turned him down because he found the whole idea "unbritish"; Wingate then told Churchill of his idea; Churchill liked it so much he gave him carte blanche to do as he liked; Wingate immediately recruited every soldier being held in Deolali Military prison in India for his new unit; and so the famous "Chindits" were created. Field Marshal Slim later wrote in his memoirs that "at least Wingate managed to take all the psychopaths in my command out of my hands".
</li><li> Frank Abagnale, author/protagonist of the book and movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchMeIfYouCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchMeIfYouCan">Catch Me If You Can</a></em> and almost undeniably at least a partial inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em>, ultimately went to work for the Feds to help them spot check forgeries. Although in reality, unlike the movie, he was paroled normally before ever consulting for the Feds. At the same time he also began consulting for the private sector and began making rather large amounts of money.
</li><li> The "Musta nuoli" (Black Arrow) battalion (21. ErP) in the Finnish Army, made up from paroled felons and prison wardens. The commander of the battalion was legendary Nikke Pärmi, who said <em>now all the thieves and killers were in the job for which they already had education</em>. Criminal convicts proved to be very reliable and trustworthy, while political convicts were liable to defect. The latter could expect no quarter on the hands of the former when caught.

</li></ul></li><li> Best way to catch a hacker? Have someone who thinks like a hacker. Best way to have someone think like a hacker? Hire a former hacker. Happens to many criminals to help find a flaw he would look for in his employer's plan.
<ul><li> On occasion, hackers have actually hacked their desired employer, as a sort of job interview. One that the employer didn't know about. It tends not to go so well; most so-called "hackers" who find a job this way are normally just professional web developers using nothing but the View Source function of their browser and perhaps an ordinary network traffic-analysis tool. Gaining access to confidential information this way is <em>not</em> going to make you popular, even if the only thing you do with it is email the company's tech support centre with a warning.

</li><li> The French Foreign Legion was famous for not asking too many questions of its recruits. Those who survived their tour of duty were rewarded with French citizenship and new identities, so this was a possible exit from a life of crime. Nowadays they have tightened up their recruiting policy and no longer accept known criminals. The Foreign Legion is also famous for often having fought against overwhelming odds - and won. Politicians did not want to sent Frenchmen on the suicide assignments and the Foreign Legion soldiers knew nobody was going to bail them out or spend much on them if they were captured which was quite motivating in a few battles.
</li><li> In the days of early vaccine, some royals had criminals vaccinated to ensure they wouldn't catch the illness from it before giving it to their family (if they survived they wouldn't be hanged, although there was at least one case of a criminal who already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">survived the disease in question</a>).

He offered his services as a possible Nazi spy so he could get out and get back to England. With a rap sheet that could land him 14 years in prison if he was ever found by the British authorities and the ease he could blend into the English culture, the Nazis accepted Chapman's offer and spent a good chunk of 1940s cash to train him in espionage. The trope was later subverted however when, over his time training with the Nazis, Chapman changed his mind and immediately sought out MI5 when he landed in Britain so he could be used as a double agent against the Germans.
</li><li> Isaac Boro led a failed secessionist struggle against the Nigerian Government in the '60s, for a "Niger Delta Republic". When, in 1967, the more serious secession of Biafra led to the Nigerian Civil War, the Federal Government released him in exchange for military service. He led a group of commandos familiar with the dense Niger Delta Rainforest, and was instrumental in the Federal Army's retaking that region. During a battle where his unit was mixed in with Federal troops, he was shot in the back of the head.
</li><li> The South Korean Unit 684 was composed of petty criminals and unemployed youths, brutally trained and sent to kill the North Korean leader. However, relations improved and the mission was cancelled, leading to a mutiny and the unit being exterminated.

This was after the burning of the SS <em>Normandie</em>, believed at the time to be a result of sabotage. It's been claimed that the Mafia set fire to the <em>Normandie</em> to bring this about (though this is doubted by most historians); it's also questionable whether the docks were in any danger from Italian-American dockworkers committing sabotage or spying. Regardless of his services, Luciano was deported to Italy after the war.
