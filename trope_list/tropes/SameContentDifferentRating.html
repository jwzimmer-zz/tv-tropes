But what's this? "Rated M for Mature?" "Parents Strongly Cautioned?" "Not for children under 17?" What's all this nonsense? The last work in the series, the one before it and <em>all</em> of its predecessors have been perfectly family-friendly. Sure, there might have been a little violence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">an odd bit of innuendo that flew over your head 20 years ago</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateToThePunchline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateToThePunchline">that makes you chuckle looking back</a> or a joke or two that pushed the boundaries of what would today be considered good taste, but certainly things haven't changed <em>that</em> much, have they? Has the franchise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">taken an unexpected turn</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> while you weren't looking?
</p><p>You pop in the disc (or crack the cover) and find, surprise surprise, that the series hasn't really changed at all. What's changed is how its content is <em>seen</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedObscenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedObscenity">Something that might have been perfectly innocuous and acceptable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">20 or 10 or even five years ago is now regarded as</a> automatic grounds for a rating bump, even if everything else in the series is all rainbows and unicorns. This also happens as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MediaClassifications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MediaClassifications">ratings systems</a> grow more robust over time, introducing more tiers of ratings and allowing for more precise classification. More <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> cases can be chalked up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">overzealous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> cracking down on content that was once acceptable (or, at the very least, wasn't considered a cause for concern by more level-headed audiences).

It can work both ways too: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros1">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em> was bumped up from 3 to 12 for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> Virtual Console release due to the presence of several gambling minigames, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetDeadlocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetDeadlocked">Ratchet: Deadlocked</a></em> was dropped down from T to E10+ for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> remaster due to shifting standards on what contituted a T rating.
</p><p>Alternatively, a work's rating may be consistently the same for its versions or editions in one region, but different in another. What might be perceived as family-friendly for, say, Japan or Europe, may not be deemed adequate for younger players in the Americas. Once again, this can be traced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> and cultural perceptions towards content in media.

</li></ul></li><li> Australian children's network <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC3">ABC3</a> has aired several anime which were rated M on DVD with a PG rating, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampireKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampireKnight">Vampire Knight</a></em>. The only one that's been edited among this is <em>Madoka Magica</em>, and it was edited for language rather than the violence which actually got it an M rating on DVD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em> consistently received ratings of TV-PG to TV-14 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, up until the ninth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo">Second Semester</a></em>. From that point on, the ratings were bumped up to <em>TV-MA</em>... with hardly any change at all in the romantic comedy formula. Granted, the first episode of the second season has a surprising amount of violence, even if it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>. This seems to have been fixed as of January 2016, with every episode now carrying a TV-PG rating.
</li><li> A single, comedic-toned filler episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> got a 16+ rating for the Hungarian broadcast. It may have been because of one use of the S-word, though since the word is used very often in other, more serious episodes (along with other instances of foul language), one has to wonder why they picked this one to be "too much" for the standard 12+ rating. Since the TV channel stopped using rating signs, this phenomenon ceased to be a problem. Now you don't know the rating for anything.
</li><li> In Australia, the first volume (and, as a result, the later box set and complete collection) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> were rated MA15+ while the rest of the series were rated G or PG. The reason is because of Kimura's joke about drinking the pool water and more specifically because child prodigy Chiyo-chan was present. The rest of the series generally makes it clear that Chiyo-chan is not one of Kimura's targets, hence the lower ratings... though let's face it, a pedophile teacher being acceptable in an otherwise family friendly show is one of those things that only Japan can get away with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> gets this in two ways:
<ul><li> In America, when the manga was first released in flipped left-to-right format, it was rated for readers 8+. Its second release, in original right-to-left, was rated 13+. There were no substantive changes between the two beyond the flip (and maybe a few more references to Japanese culture); if anything, the original's language was a bit cruder.
</li><li> The complete collection of the anime was released in 2010 in the UK with a '12' rating, however for some reason, the first individual DVD volume, released in mid-2011, gets a '15' rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em> got this in <em>three</em> ways:
<ul><li> The original release by Pioneer carried a 13-and-up age recommendation, until the film officially got an R rating by the MPAA.
</li><li> The film was rated "14" in Nova Scotia on its original release in 1990, but a re-release in 2001 received an "R" rating for extreme violence.
</li><li> The film's original release was rated '12' for cinema by the BBFC in 1990, but was bumped up to a '15' rating in 1991 due to the lack of a '12' category for home video. Re-reviewing the film's strong sexual/bloody violence and language in 2002, 2011 and 2016, it hasn't been downgraded, despite the post-1994 presence of a '12' category for DVDs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelCop">Angel Cop</a></em> was rated "14" in Nova Scotia when released in separate volumes for violence and offensive language. A year after the last single volume, a complete collection was released, and ended up getting an "R" rating for offensive language throughout and extreme violence.
</li><li> The <em>Behind the Scenes!!</em> manga was rated Teen in print by Viz Media, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.comixology.com/Behind-the-Scenes-1/digital-comic/328706?ref=c2VyaWVzL3ZpZXcvZGVza3RvcC9ncmlkTGlzdC9HcmFwaGljTm92ZWxz">'All Ages'<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Comixology. (Volumes 2 and on were corrected to a proper 12+ rating.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk2016">Berserk (2016)</a></em> received an 18+ rating in Quebec, a quite unusual rating for a non-hentai anime (and even <em>then</em>, some softcore hentai have managed to get a 16+). By comparison, all previous adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk1997">original anime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BerserkTheGoldenAgeArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BerserkTheGoldenAgeArc">Golden Age Arc films</a>) were rated as 13+.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BeyondTheBoundary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BeyondTheBoundary">Beyond the Boundary</a></em>, despite being officially rated '15' by the BBFC in the UK, carries a '12' rating on the Animax UK streaming site.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinboGamiGa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinboGamiGa">Binbō-gami ga!</a></em> was rated TV-MA when Funimation released the complete series on home video, Funimation has since changed the rating to TV-14 on their official page for the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender">Blue Gender</a></em> was rated TV-MA through every (uncut) platform except for the subtitled version on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, which received a TV-PG rating. Episode 15 actually got an 18+ age restriction by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> due to its strong sexual content, rendering the TV-PG rating futile. At least one DVD release by Funimation also bares an incorrect PG rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> has two separate listings for a "mega pack" in Nova Scotia's ratings database - one is a PG, the other is a 14A. They were rated six days apart, and are identical in length. Leaves one wondering which one would actually be enforced if you bought this mega pack in Nova Scotia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>:
<ul><li> The manga series was rated for all ages on its initial Tokyopop printings, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.comixology.com/Cardcaptor-Sakura-Omnibus-Vol-1/digital-comic/230554">carries a '12+ Only' rating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Comixology.
</li><li> Geneon Entertainment admitted to doing this for their DVD releases of the subtitled version of the series, in response to complaints that the dubbed and subtitled versions weren't labeled clearly enough. As such, the dubbed DVDs were rated for ages 7+, and the subtitled DVDs for 13+.
</li><li> For some reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation's</a> streaming service lists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardCaptorSakuraClearCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardCaptorSakuraClearCard">Clear Card</a> as TV-PG while the original series is listed as TV-14, even though they both have the exact same content that wouldn't warrant a rating higher than PG (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt">though the controversies surrounding Mr. Terada may have had something to do with it</a>).
</li><li> In contrast to Funimation, Netflix gives the original series a mere Y7 rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins">Casshern Sins</a></em> carries a TV-MA rating, but was broadcast on Toonami with seventeen out of its twenty-four episodes carrying a <strong>TV-PG</strong> rating, and the remaining seven only being rated as TV-14. No graphic content was censored from the Toonami broadcast, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a></em> was initially rated PG in Australia and New Zealand on VHS for "Low level violence" (just "Violence" in New Zealand). The "special edition" DVD was later rerated as M in Australia for "Moderate animated violence", and also in New Zealand, keeping the same "Violence" descriptor. Where things get <em>really</em> weird is that New Zealand has <em>another</em> PG-rated listing for <em>Cagliostro</em> approved for DVD, Blu-ray, the Internet, and VHS.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWorkBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWorkBaby">Cells at Work: Baby!</a></em>: Despite being essentially a chibified version of the original series, <em>Baby!</em> is bumped up from shonen to seinen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChisSweetHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChisSweetHome">Chi's Sweet Home</a></em> is rated for all ages in print, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.comixology.com/Chis-Sweet-Home-Vol-1/digital-comic/319573?ref=cGFnZS92aWV3L2Rlc2t0b3AvZ3JpZExpc3QvbGlzdDk4ODA">carries a '12+ Only' rating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Comixology.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>'s "Hell of a Holiday" limited edition Christmas box set received a '14A' in Nova Scotia, despite just being a repack of the complete series set which had been rated 'PG'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Citrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Citrus">Citrus</a></em> was originally rated TV-MA when originally simulcast on Funimation; however, after the sexual content turned out to be a bit overhyped, it was downgraded to a TV-14 on its official site page and home video release.
</li><li> Volumes 2 and 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ComicParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ComicParty">Comic Party</a></em>'s second season received a '14A' on their original release in Nova Scotia, but were downgraded to a 'PG' for the complete collection.
</li><li> While uncut DVD releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> were rated for 13+ by Bandai Entertainment and TV-14 by Funimation, uncut showings on Adult Swim of some episodes such as "Ballad of Fallen Angels" have received up to a TV-MA-LSV rating.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em> is rated MA15+ on the Australian streaming service AnimeLab, it was bumped up to an R18+ when released on DVD for "high impact themes of sexual violence". The second season is however MA15+ despite the rape scene being more disturbing than the one in Episode 1.
</li><li> The first two DVD volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> have separate listings in Nova Scotia's rating database: one with a 'PG', one with a '14A'.
</li><li> Inverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri">Digimon Adventure tri.</a></em>. Unlike the original series, it has a darker tone, fanservice, and actual bloodshed from a human character, completely uncut in the English dub, which even adds some mild profanity. Yet all six films received a PG rating by the MPAA, the same as the heavily edited <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">Digimon: The Movie</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing">Dinosaur King</a></em>, which originally aired on national Saturday morning television with a TV-Y7 rating, is rated <strong>TV-14</strong> when it's shown on Primo TV.

</li><li> Episodes 64-66 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> were originally rated R<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1boge');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1boge" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1boge');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">equivalent to an NC-17 or 18+ rating</span> in Manitoba despite there being no major difference between them and previous episodes rated PG. They were later downgraded to a 14A for "Extreme Violence", and then again were downgraded to a PG on the complete season DVDs.
</li><li> Despite the "shonen romantic comedy" nature of the show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFOUltramaidenValkyrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFOUltramaidenValkyrie">UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie</a></em> has a TV-MA rating. However, Spain apparently aired on a kids network, to no problem, though.
</li><li> The complete series collection of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> released by ADV Films in 2009 carries an 18A Canadian rating. Despite being almost identical (the only difference is the artwork on the new version), the DVD/Blu-Ray rerelease from ADV in 2013 carries only a 14A Canadian rating. On a minor note, the American rating goes from TV-MA for explicit language (L), graphic sexual content (S), and extreme violence (V) to TV-MA for graphic sexual content (S) and extreme violence (V), despite both collections having the same amount of bad language.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>'s spinoff manga, <em>Gravity Boys and Lifting Girl</em>, was originally rated Teen/13+ by Bandai Entertainment, but on its digital rerelease by Viz Media was bumped up to Older Teen/16+ with no difference in content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first volume was initially the only volume rated 13+ in Quebec, for the scene in which Excel receives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture">Electric Torture</a> and seems aroused by it. These same episodes were rerated G for the complete collection release.
</li><li> Even though the Australian ratings board gave the final volume of the series (which includes the infamous too-hot-for-Japanese-TV "Going Too Far" episode) an M rating, Madman decided to bump this up to a MA15+ when they initially released it, perhaps to avoid parental complaints. When the series was rereleased in a complete collection set, Madman went back to the M rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> was officially rated G in Australia; however, wanting to avoid controversy, Madman applied a PG rating to all their Australian releases of the series. Over in New Zealand, it received an M rating.
</li><li> Inversion: The first volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories">Ghost Stories</a></em> may have warranted a TV-PG rating by ADV Films; but the show continues to get more explicit while it continues with the same rating.
</li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> have received a '15' rating on the Animax UK streaming site, despite the fact that no episode of the series has received above a '12' by the BBFC.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> DVDs released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a> were rated TV-14. This is rather surprising, considering that all other companies that released both the anime and the Unlimited Blade Works movie rated it as TV-MA (as both have pretty considerable amounts of blood, gore, and violence).
</li><li> Subverted in a way by Central Park Media when they released the soft-core <em>Fencer Of Minerva</em>. The back of the DVD box was rated 16 and up. At least some of the DVDs when played would warn of explicit content and state that no one under 18 could watch it.
</li><li> So far, Toonami has given every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em> a TV-MA rating (even those which have little to no fanservice whatsoever), and censored a handful of particularly risque bits out of some episodes. Meanwhile, on Sentai Filmworks' home video and streaming/digital releases, it carries a TV-14 rating completely uncensored.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutariEcchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutariEcchi">Futari Ecchi</a></em> originally received an 18+ in Quebec for its first volume and a 16+ for the second, despite no notable difference in content. When released in a complete collection, the episodes on the first volume were downgraded to a 16+.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz">Gantz</a></em> was first released in Germany, most episodes received a FSK 16 rating, other than the first three, which received a FSK 12 rating. Consider the fact that in the first three episodes, the viewer will see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">decapitation, attempted rape, bestiality, full-frontal nudity, gory alien violence, and hear a <em>ton</em> of F-bombs</span>. In fact, <em>Gantz</em> never really top its first three episodes in terms of explicit content. However, upon the 'director's cut' rerelease of the show, the episodes were rerated FSK 16.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo">Girls Bravo</a></em> volumes 2 and 3 on DVD received an "R" rating in Nova Scotia for graphic sexual content and explicit nudity, which was a bit of a shocker considering sexual content at the "R" rating usually consists of artistic real sex or full-blown porn, of which <em>Girls Bravo</em> has neither. Other volumes received an 18A despite the same level of content, and a complete collection of the series later downgraded these episodes to an 18A.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series received a FSK 12 in Germany for every episode, but the OVA collection received a FSK 16 despite no increase in objectionable content. (Sure, there was a swimsuit OVA, but it reused the swimsuits/fanservice that had already been featured early on in the show.)
</li><li> The series is rated as <em>AV15+</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note272no');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note272no" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note272no');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A rating never meant to be used outside of television that was officially retired in late 2015.</span> on iTunes Australia despite the Australian DVD release carrying an M rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em> was bumped up from a "6" to a "9" in the Netherlands in 2011 due to a complaint about how depressing the film was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow">Gregory Horror Show</a></em> received an 18A in Manitoba for its first season, and a PG for its second and third seasons. As to what in the show warranted an 18A, the ratings board didn't list - though they gave the second/third seasons subadvisories for "not recommended for young children", even though the second and third seasons are on the same content level as the first (or maybe a bit stronger, considering we discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gregory's secret love for dirty magazines</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nekozombie's highly traumatic past</span> in these seasons). By comparison, all three seasons got a 14A in Nova Scotia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei">Haibane Renmei</a></em> was rated PG in the UK for all but the last volume, which was rated 12 for "moderate sex references". (These moderate sex references actually come from a trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em>, but still bumped the whole disc up.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu">Haikyuu!!</a></em> is currently <a class="urllink" href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/tv-season/haikyu-vol-2-original-japanese-version/id1160940392?showLC=true">listed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on iTunes Australia as <strong>R18+</strong>, despite the show being classified on DVD as PG.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> was re-added to Netflix in 2019, the rating was changed from TV-14 to TV-MA.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica">Junjou Romantica</a></em>'s first season is officially rated M on Australian home video, however carries an MA15+ rating on the AnimeLab streaming service.
</li><li> The North American release of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> manga by Viz Media is rated for ages 16+, perhaps over concern of its mafia themes being too controversial for younger American readers. When Tokyopop Germany published the series, they lowered the rating to 13+.
</li><li> TokyoPop's translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Life" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Life">Life</a></em> was originally listed as being for "Older Teens". This was bumped up to "Mature" a few volumes later due to the heavy themes of bullying and slight sexual themes of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> got its rating decreased from Older Teen (16+) to Teen (13+) upon Viz acquiring its license after Tokyopop's demise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>'s special <em>Love Hina Again</em> got an M in New Zealand for sexual references while the rest of the series, including the spring and summer specials, was rated PG for low level violence and sexual references. Love Hina Again doesn't get any more graphic then the rest of the series does...
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NegimaSecondSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NegimaSecondSeason">Negima!?</a></em> which was supposed to be closer to the manga got a TV-MA in America while the original series, rated TV-PG, had more fanservice and suggestive scenes. Australia and New Zealand avert this by giving the original series an M and the remake a PG.

Upon the release of the third volume, the rating was raised to Teen, which is much more appropriate considering the series' occasional nudity and sexual innuendo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Needless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Needless">NEEDLESS</a></em> was originally rated TV-14-VLD<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3xfh2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3xfh2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3xfh2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">VLD standing for "intense violence, strong coarse language, intensely suggestive dialogue"</span> when released in individual collections by Sentai Filmworks.

<ul><li> The rating in Germany seems to highly vary on the release you get; volume 3, which was rated FSK 12 on its original release, has a <strong>FSK 0</strong> (suitable for all ages) on the Platinum edition. In the same way, volumes 5 and 6, which were originally rated FSK 12, are FSK 6 on the Platinum edition. In a strange flip-flop, the Platinum rating on volume 7 <em>increases</em> from a FSK 6 to a FSK 12.
</li><li> One episode that was rated 12 when it was rated by the BBFC individually (episode 9, "Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win!") was rerated PG on DVD a few years later.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein">Noein</a></em> ranged from a PG to 12 rating by the BBFC, before receiving a sudden bump-up to a 15 on its last volume - the problem wasn't with the volume itself, which was rated 12, but the 15-rated bloopers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em>'s second volume has two identical listings in the German ratings database, with the exception of one being FSK 12 and the other FSK 16 and being rated twelve days apart. The actual DVD has the FSK 16 rating printed on it.

</li><li> Russian network 2x2 doesn't air <em>anything</em> with lower then a 12+ rating (seemingly out of fear of attracting a younger audience to their more adult programs), which has led to such oddities as showings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PonyoOnTheCliffByTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PonyoOnTheCliffByTheSea">Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea</a></em> being rated for 12+.

In the digital rerelease, they're both rated "Mature (18+)", with no difference or uncensoring in content (the digital version of the latter still censors bare breasts as the print version did).
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em> was rated 14A in all Canadian provinces except Quebec, it was shown on the kids' channel YTV completely uncut with a PG rating.

It eventually received an MA15+ rating; copies are floating around in Australia with both ratings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite being rated as TV-14 on every other streaming service (as well as Viz Media's DVDs), the show carries a TV-MA rating on Vudu.
</li><li> Originally, only seasons 1-4 of <em>Ranma</em> were rated PG in Ontario, despite the content level staying pretty consistent throughout. Seasons 5 and 6 were originally given an 18A rating in Ontario in 2003, and season 7 was given a 14A rating. These three seasons were eventually rerated PG for a 2008 rerelease of the series.

</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> film, when originally released as <em>Evangelion 2.0</em>, received a '14A' rating in Nova Scotia. When released again as <em>Evangelion 2.22</em> (with better editing and contrast), it only received a 'PG' rating, despite no removal of mature content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>'s complete limited edition Australian release has an MA-15+ while the individual box sets are rated M (the difference between M and MA-15+ is that MA-15+ is more restrictive and most TV and film companies are wary about showing MA-15+ content since that rating allows for stronger content<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note68yqa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note68yqa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note68yqa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">until you get to R-18 and X-18, which is only for content that's extremely violent or explicitly sexual</span>). It might be the OVAs added onto the complete edition, but when you consider how gory the Kyoto arc was, the OVAs weren't really that much graphic.
</li><li> Nova Scotia gave <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> volume 2 an 18A rating when first released; however, the episodes on that volume were downgraded to a 14A for the complete collection.
</li><li> Volume 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em> was initially rated 16+ in Quebec for horror while all previous volumes had been rated G. When rereleased in a complete collection, it was downgraded to 13+.
</li><li> Despite every individual season collection of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> receiving a 'PG' in Nova Scotia, a bundle of all them received a '14A' for reasons unknown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> received a 12 rating for its first season in the UK by the BBFC and a 15 for the second season.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>'s Australian release has a PG for all but the last volume, which is rated M for violence, despite the fact that there wasn't really any increase in violence in the final volume. Perhaps it refers to sexual violence, given that towards the end the main antagonist attempts to rape Asuna but fails. Aniplex just slaps the whole series on the North American release with a 13+.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTatamiGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTatamiGalaxy">The Tatami Galaxy</a></em> was rated TV-PG when FUNimation uploaded it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a> and FUNimation's official site, however, it somehow carries a <strong>TV-MA</strong> rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> was released for years in its uncut form by Geneon with a 13-and-up recommendation. However, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> rereleased the OVA series, it received a TV-MA rating, with no bonus features or anything justifying this increase in rating.
</li><li> Despite the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> manga being released in print in North America with an Older Teen rating, it carries an "Adults Only" warning on Comixology, cautioning for "graphic sexuality."
</li><li> When the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime first began airing in the US, it was rated TV-Y on Kids WB and in syndication. When the series moved to Cartoon Network from season 9 onward, the rating was bumped up to TV-Y7-FV and the rating was modified accordingly for reruns and DVD releases of earlier seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie</a></em> was initially rated 16+ in Quebec despite having no more graphic content than the G-rated series. The board rated it as such due to trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DarkCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DarkCat">Dark Cat</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IronVirginJun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IronVirginJun">Iron Virgin Jun</a></em> on the VHS release which contained depictions of "monster phalluses."

One forum user at the time claimed that their DirecTV schedule had the movie listed as TV-PG-V, so the Y7-FV rating was more than likely just a mistake on the network's part.

<ul><li> In Ireland, the IFCO has a specific '16' borderline category for cinema. Once these films are released on video, they're re-rated '15' or '18'. According to director Ger Connolly, upgrading to '18' happens only in rarer cases - such as <em>Overlord</em> and <em>Red Sparrow</em>.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SBS">SBS</a> is legally not allowed to air R18+ content on their main channel, they have slipped through showing some uncut R18+ films with an MA15+/AV15+ rating, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KillerCondom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KillerCondom">Killer Condom</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shame">Shame</a></em>.
</li><li> Several films that were rated PG-13 (or even PG) in theaters have carried a TV-MA rating for uncut evening showings on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FXNetworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FXNetworks">FX</a> and its sister channels, for reasons such as one F-bomb, the word 'shit', gore, or brief nudity. Examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaddysHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaddysHome">Daddy's Home</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaperTowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaperTowns">Paper Towns</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RideAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RideAlong">Ride Along 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys">Terminator Genisys</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWalk">The Walk</a></em>.
</li><li> In Germany some films are refused ratings from the FSK which inevitably leads to them ending up on the Index which means they mustn't be advertised, can only be sold to persons 18 and up and can only be shown on TV with drastic edits. When 25 years have passed movies are removed from the Index and can be rated again by the FSK which then end up giving them ratings of 18 and sometimes even 16 (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator">Predator</a></em> in 2010).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a> is an interesting example of this, highlighting the differences between the USA's MPAA and the UK's BBFC. PG-13 and 12A are largely the same <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8aj7y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8aj7y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8aj7y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">both higher than PG and not for young kids. 12A requites under 12s watch with a parent, while PG-13 is 13+ recommended but not age restricted</span>, and are followed by the R and 15 (which differ moreso) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9pmi1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9pmi1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9pmi1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Both the lightest 'no kids' rating. R requires anyone under 17 to watch with an adult, while a 15 cannot be screened to anyone younger than 15</span>. The strange part is that while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> (the Ultimate Cut) got an <strong>R</strong> and <strong>12A</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad (2016)</a></em> got a <strong>PG-13</strong> and <strong>15</strong>. Based on their summary, the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> ensemble and their enjoyment at wreaking havoc is what pushed the latter's BBFC rating up, while Superman and Batman's violence (and attitude towards it) was more acceptable.
</li><li> In 1997 in the UK, Touchstone Pictures released 2 films (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir">Con Air</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>) with '15' ratings for their cinema release. However, the BBFC felt that their decisions were too lenient and so they upgraded them to '18' for the video releases, where they remain to this day.
</li><li> In Ireland, cinema and video releases have separate ratings systems.
<ul><li> The video system is the same as in the UK (U/G, PG, 12, 15, 18).
</li><li> The cinema system is the same as in the UK up to 12A. Afterwards, 15 and 18 are split into 15A, 16 and 18, which means that a film which gets a 16 for cinema can get either a 15 or an 18 on video.
</li></ul></li><li> The ratings for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HammerHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HammerHorror">Hammer Studios</a> Dracula films are all over the place for no discernible reason. Incredibly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaHasRisenFromTheGrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaHasRisenFromTheGrave">Dracula Has Risen from the Grave</a>,</em> which features Dracula being messily impaled causing blood to gush from his mouth and eyes, was rated <em>G</em>, which has never been updated. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TasteTheBloodofDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TasteTheBloodofDracula">very next film</a>, which features a similar level of violence along with some nudity, was originally rated GP (a precursor to PG) but was upgraded to an R in 2004, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaAD1972" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaAD1972">Dracula A.D. 1972</a></em> has kept its PG despite opening with yet another very nasty impalement scene. The fact that these films are all sold together in a DVD set along with the unrated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorrorOfDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorrorOfDracula">Horror of Dracula</a></em> makes it even more noticeable because there are four different MPAA symbols on the packaging.
<ul><li> In Ireland it was still rated 15 as of 2011 (their equivalent to R), which <em>is</em> the same as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy">Dollars Trilogy</a>, for "strong western style violence and moderate sensuality". In the UK, this so-called "strong violence" was only considered mild (so just worthy of a PG!), instead earning a 12 for "moderate sex and sexual threat" for the same Blu-ray release in 2011.
</li></ul></li><li> Several PG-13 films released in New Zealand have been slapped with an R13 rating due to differences and treatment of violence and sex.
<ul><li> In 2016, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad</a></em> was originally classified M in New Zealand (which has been cross-rated from Australia). However a member of the public complained that the movie has some menacing and shocking scenes <a class="urllink" href="https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/313207/suicide-squad-not-suitable-for-children,-chief-censor-rules">that prompt the censors to do something about it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Similarly, the James McAvoy film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split">Split</a></em> had also run into issues in New Zealand after they disagree with the Australian censors. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/89853196/nz-censors-split-with-australians-over-rating-for-shaymalan-horror-featuring-cannibalism">Again it prompted the censors to do something about it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The censored version of Deadpool 2 entitled "Once a Upon a Deadpool" was rerated to R13 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/109345236/once-upon-a-deadpool-nz-censor-breaks-with-australia-and-bans-under13s">after it was originally rated as M<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In a bizarre circumstance around the time the PG-13 rating was introduced, two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s films actually swapped ratings! Originally, when the MPAA introduced its film rating system, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> was rated M (later PG), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TornCurtain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TornCurtain">Torn Curtain</a></em> was rated R. In 1984, the situation was reversed, with <em>Psycho</em> being rated R (though no rating appeared on video releases at all until the '90s) and <em>Torn Curtain</em> being rated PG.
</li><li> In general, television ratings of MPAA-rated films can be a funny thing. There have been examples of older G-rated films being rated TV-PG and sometimes even TV-14 on television. Similarly, PG-rated films have sometimes been broadcast as TV-14 and sometimes even <em>TV-MA</em> (one such example was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em>), and there have been PG-13 films with a TV-MA rating on television, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister">Twister</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2015">Fantastic Four (2015)</a></em>.
</li><li> Due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a> and how years have changed, many movies released in Québec were giving lower ratings from when they first came up (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980">Friday the 13th</a></em> was originally given a rating of 18+, the equivalent of a NC-17 to 13+, the equivalent of a PG-13.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty">American Beauty</a></em> was originally rated 14 in Brazil without anyone actually watching the film, rating it entirely off its synopsis. It was rerated 18 on home video.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie">American Pie</a></em> first came out on VHS in the United States there was a lot of backlash about high school age kids not being able to watch a movie about high school students as it was given an R rating (for nudity and sexual content). Countries such as Canada who don't rate as strongly against nudity didn't have this problem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BarryLyndon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BarryLyndon">Barry Lyndon</a></em> had its rating raised from PG to 12A in 2016, due to the sexual references and some mild violence, including whipping.
</li><li> The Russian government threatened to ban <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeautyAndTheBeast2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeautyAndTheBeast2017">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">containing an openly gay character</span>, but the film will be released there anyways with a 16+ rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BedknobsAndBroomsticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BedknobsAndBroomsticks">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a></em> was re-rated PG by the BBFC in 2016 for its cinema re-release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoTheBloodyResearch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoTheBloodyResearch">due to the scene when Charlie shouts out "Not bloody likely!" to Colonel Heller</a>, despite a DVD release as of 2009/2013 carrying a U rating. The Blu-ray release of the same year also carried a PG rating, on account of the bonus features.
</li><li> The 1999 British film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigTease">The Big Tease</a></em> received an R rating in the United States and the equivalent of a PG almost everywhere else (although it received a 15 in its home country for 'infrequent strong language'). Although the reason given is language, there are very few instances of profanity, leading some people to believe it was more harshly rated in the U.S. because the main character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackInTheCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackInTheCloset">very blatantly homosexual</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915">The Birth of a Nation (1915)</a></em> has been rerated in several countries due to its racist thematic material. In the UK, it was originally released with a 'U' rating, which is now a 15. In Australia, the rating was changed from PG to M on rerelease. Both the BBFC and OFLC note racism as the reason for the rating change.
</li><li> Germany gave <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BottleShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BottleShock">Bottle Shock</a></em> an FSK 6 (suitable for ages 6 and older) for theatrical release, but an FSK 16 for DVD release. It is not clear if the consumption of wine in the film has anything to do with this, as the legal drinking age for wine and beer is 16 in Germany.
</li><li> <em>City by the Sea</em>, a 2002 crime drama starring Robert De Niro, was rated 15 by the BBFC for cinema release because, despite a scene showing two characters 'freebasing' (taking drugs in a non-salt form), the film had a strong anti-drugs message. However, the rating was upgraded to 18 for the video release after seeking expert advice, which told the BBFC that the scene, if viewed repeatedly at home, could provide instructive details about drug use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthCaughtFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthCaughtFire">The Day the Earth Caught Fire</a>:</em> When first released in the UK in 1962, it was rated X, which meant over 16 only. The Blu-Ray release is rated 12, and starts with the original rating card.
</li><li> Despite the movie airing on the same night, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants">Descendants</a> 2</em> is rated TV-PG on ABC while on Disney Channel, Disney XD and Freeform of all places, aired it with a TV-G rating.
</li><li> The original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraterrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraterrestrial">ET</a></em> received a G rating in Australia. Because the 20th-anniversary re-release was edited (to remove guns), the film had to be re-submitted, and received a PG rating for "supernatural themes".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a></em> was initially released in Australia for its theatrical release with an R18+ and two seconds of cuts for underage sex. Modern-day re-releases have received an M rating completely uncut.
</li><li> For a 2011 re-release in UK cinemas, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters (1984)</a></em> was passed 12A by the BBFC for "moderate sex references", up from the PG of its original 1984 release (five years before 12 was introduced). The film had still been released on DVD as PG as of 2009.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather Part II</a></em> was rated PG upon its original release in New Zealand, but on the "Coppola Restoration" edition was bumped up to an M.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrudge">The Grudge</a></em> was originally cross-rated M from Australia in New Zealand, however was rerated R16 due to complaints about the level of horror.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies have been inexplicably shuffled throughout rating systems around the world. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em> received a PG rating in the United States even though it was more disturbing than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">previous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">entries</a> in the series that were rated PG-13. In the Netherlands, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">the third movie</a> demanded the creation of an entirely new rating— 9. In Germany, it was the first <em>Harry Potter</em> film to be rated FSK 12 (suitable for ages 12 and older) due to its rather dark and dismal atmosphere. In Australia, it was initially given the M rating, but was reclassified as PG when it came out on DVD.
</li><li> <em>Henry &amp; June</em> was the first film to recive the new NC-17 rating by the MPAA in the United States after its introducton in 1990. The film recived the equivalent of an NC-17 rating around the world, with a few exceptions, most noticeably Australia, where the filmed passed with a lenient M rating.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note106zzh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note106zzh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note106zzh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Recommended for mature audiences, though no actual viewing restrictions apply.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IKnowWhatYouDidLastSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IKnowWhatYouDidLastSummer">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a></em>, a 1997 slasher horror, received an 18 rating from the BBFC when released in cinemas, for its 'strong horror and violence'. On video this was downgraded to a 15, due to the effects being "considerably diminished on the small screen".
</li><li> The rating for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> was changed by the BBFC from PG to 12A in 2012 on theatrical re-release. This is because when the film was originally classified, there was no 12A/12 rating, although it was now considered a borderline 12A/15 film for its bloody violence and gore. They relented with the former as a "compromise", due to it being so well-known and available unrestricted for 37 years.
<ul><li> Earlier, a DVD of the same film had been rated 12 on account of the special features, for using strong language (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">i.e. "fuck"</a>), prompting a recall of an earlier print run which had been rated PG.
<ul><li> Ironically, the ratings in Ireland went <em>the other way</em>, with the film being a 15 but the bonus disc being a PG. This was until 2012, when the film was rated 12A for cinema and similarly downgraded to 12 on video.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> has a variation in the UK. It was considered <em>just above</em> <strong>PG</strong> standards when released, so the BBFC compromised and allowed for a PG so long as advertising (and the later VHS cover) carried the warning <em>"contains sequences which may be particularly disturbing to younger children or those of a sensitive disposition"</em>. The DVD and various theatrical re-releases carry the PG with no warning, as did the first two sequels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a> received a <strong>12A</strong>, being the first JP film since the rating's introduction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid2010">The Karate Kid (2010)</a></em> got this twice:
<ul><li> The film was originally classified M in Australia, which the studio appealed and managed to get down to a PG.
</li><li> The film was reclassified from 6 to 12 in the Netherlands after a complaint from a mother that the level of violence was too much for her seven-year-old daughter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em> was rerated from 12 to 16 in the Netherlands after a complaint about the level of violence in the film.
</li><li> For whatever reason, the Philippine airing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KitKittredgeAnAmericanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KitKittredgeAnAmericanGirl">Kit Kittredge: An American Girl</a></em> on ETC was given a PG rating, despite the original American theatrical and video releases being G-rated. And that's from a film and television ratings board known for giving inconsistent ratings on theatrical features and television programmes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastChristmas">Last Christmas</a></em> ended up with a PG rating in Australia (at least for cinema release), but it was rated PG-13 in the States, 12 in the UK and M in New Zealand. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/23/too-broad-film-classification-ratings-leaving-children-exposed-to-unsuitable-content">You could say that the Aussie censors are very confusing but weird in their decisions.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeOfBrian">Life of Brian</a></em> was re-released in the UK in 2019 with a 12A certificate, after more than 30 years of it being rated 15. (It was originally rated AA, the precursor to 15, in its theatrical release.) In the US, it's rated R, but it has not been resubmitted to the MPAA since 1979, and if it was ever resubmitted, it would probably still be an R due to the multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">uses of the word "fuck"</a> and brief full-frontal nudity.
</li><li> In British Columbia, a live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive">Love Live!</a></em> concert movie was rated PG as opposed to G (as the subtitled anime film had been) entirely due to the lack of subtitles. As the ratings board wasn't able to determine if the dialogue had any bad language in it, they gave it a PG "just to be safe".
</li><li> Due to growing concerns about the portrayal of sexual violence in films, the BBFC raised the rating of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMessengerTheStoryOfJoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMessengerTheStoryOfJoanOfArc">The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc</a></em> from 15 to 18 in 2020 due to scene where Joan's sister is raped.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightCowboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightCowboy">Midnight Cowboy</a></em> became the first and last X-rated film<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note119hci');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note119hci" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note119hci');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">at the time, the "X" rating was still intended to denote mature, as opposed to pornographic, content. However, the fact that the MPAA deliberately did not trademark it as with all of its other ratings marks — so that any film maker could self apply it if he or she felt necessary, meant that the porn industry soon co-opted it to get in, briefly, to mainstream theaters via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>.</span> to win an Academy Award for Best Picture, it was rereleased with an R rating though no cuts were made. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12xjm7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12xjm7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12xjm7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Zigzagged Trope</a> though. The MPAA actually had assigned it an R rating originally, but on advice of a psychologist who argued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">that the film would make homosexual activity look attractive to kids</a>, they refused the rating and self-applied the X rating. The later R rating was just a ratification of the MPAA's original decision.</span>
</li><li> In the U.S., many PG-13 films receive the TV-14 rating when aired on TV, even though they've been edited for content. Even stranger, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em> airs on MTV, it receives a TV-14 rating, despite the movie having a PG rating on video and containing little if any objectionable content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnceUponATimeInTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnceUponATimeInTheWest">Once Upon a Time in the West</a></em> features about the same amount of violence and mature themes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone">Sergio Leone</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy">previous westerns</a>, but it got an M (a precursor to PG) whereas the others all got Rs. In 2003 it was updated to a PG-13.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity">Paranormal Activity</a></em> was initially cross-rated from Australia in New Zealand with an M rating for offensive language. Due to complaints, it was reviewed by the New Zealand ratings board and was re-rated R16 for horror scenes and offensive language.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PowerRangers2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PowerRangers2017">Power Rangers (2017)</a></em> got rated 18+ in Russia (nobody under 18 admitted, equivalent to NC-17) because there's a reference to lesbianism - specifically it's fairly heavily implied that Trini, the Yellow Ranger, is a lesbian. It's rated PG-13 in the US.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheQuatermassXperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheQuatermassXperiment">The Quatermass Xperiment</a></em> was an X certificate film when it was released in 1955, due to the horror of a human transforming into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien">Starfish Alien</a> as the precursor to an invasion. By the time of the video release in 2003, it got a PG rating in the UK, possibly thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">forty years of very similar material being aimed at kids</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RyansDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RyansDaughter">Ryan's Daughter</a></em> was originally given an R rating by the MPAA for the love scene in the forest, but was downgraded to GP (later renamed PG) before its release after the studio appealed to the ratings board. In 1996, the MPAA reversed their decision and had the film re-rated R.
</li><li> In Argentina, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983">Scarface (1983)</a></em> was originally rated +18<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13xxlv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13xxlv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13xxlv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Argentine equivalent to America's NC-17 and X ratings</span>, then, it was re-rated +16<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note147f08');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note147f08" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note147f08');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Argentine equivalent of America's R rating.</span> for the 1999 re-release and finally was re-rated +13/CR<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15jqlm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15jqlm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15jqlm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The equivalent of a PG-13 in Argentina.</span> for the 2012 re-release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> received a TV-G rating on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, despite being a hard PG-rated film for suggestive humor, scary moments, and action violence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em> was rated R18+ in Australia in 1991, but got an M rating on appeal. This led to <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em> receiving a significant amount of complaints and being one of the titles to create the in-between rating of MA15+, which the movie was rerated to on a 2001 rerelease.
</li><li> The British version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spiderman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spiderman2">Spiderman 2</a></em> removed a headbutt in a fight scene in order to obtain a PG.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16aart');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16aart" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16aart');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Those cuts were restored for a UK Blu-Ray release.</span> The same cuts were made to the IMAX version, but the British censors still gave it a 12A due to the film being more intense during the IMAX presentation.
</li><li> A fairly inexplicable instance of this trope occurred with the 2000 Director's Cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em>. Initially, in 1979, the movie was released at a G rating (the only <em>Trek</em> film to be given a G). The Director's cut added no new objectionable content<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17qu6d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17qu6d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17qu6d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> indeed, it merely tightened up pacing, filled in special effects (and repaired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">Special Effects Failure</a>) that had to be scrapped due to running out of time and generally finally completed the film as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWise">Robert Wise</a> had originally intended</span>, but was rated by the MPAA as PG. The staff joked at the time that the new music mix must have done it, but one can suspect Paramount prevailing on the MPAA to up the rating for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating">a different reason.</a>
</li><li> This trope may very well be at the heart of the "Han shot first" controversy surrounding the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> Special Edition. The scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> when Han shoots Greedo after being threatened flew under the censors' radar back in 1977, but could've bumped the rating up two decades later after the PG-13 rating was created. Thus, some people speculate that this is why the scene was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSelfDefense">edited so that Greedo shot first</a>. This is especially hilarious because the film was almost rated "G" — yes, <em>G</em> — back in 1977. This despite the fact that it features charred corpses, a bloody severed arm, multiple violent deaths, <em>genocide</em>, and a "heroic" character who starts out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> smuggler.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenLoach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenLoach">Ken Loach</a>'s <em>Sweet Sixteen</em> was given an 18 rating by the BBFC for frequent uses use of the word <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">"cunt,"</a> but the local authorities of Inverclyde in Scotland overruled the decision and gave it a 15 certificate there, while the rest of Britain still kept the 18 rating.
</li><li> The Terminator'' franchise:
<ul><li> In the UK, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em> had its rating downgraded from 18 to 15 in 2000.
</li><li> The uncut version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em> was given an 18 certificate by the BBFC when it was released on laserdisc in 1992 (a censored 15-rated version was released theatrically and on VHS). The Special Edition was later granted a 15 certificate in 2001 with all previously-censored footage intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a></em> was given a R-rating in the U.S. like the other films, but in the UK it was rated 12A, the first in the franchise to get that rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisChristmas">This Christmas</a></em> is a PG-13 film that airs with a TV-14 rating on BET, but a TV-G on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVOne">TV One</a>. Both cuts retain all the violence and sexuality, but edit out a few uses of "shit".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">Transformers: Dark of the Moon</a></em> received a rating of 16+ in Hungary, whilst it's considered to be anything from a PG-13 to G movie in the rest of the world. What makes this especially peculiar is that the dub even removed or toned down most of the original movie's foul language, making the rating decision seem even more unwarranted. Yet the far more obscene and about equally violent <em>Revenge of the Fallen</em> only got a 12+ (along with the original installment).
</li><li> Initially, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">TRON</a></em> was rated PG in Australia, but was later reclassified as G (in spite of several onscreen deaths, torture, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scene</a> with sexual content) when rereleased onto DVD and Blu-Ray following the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy">the sequel</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeekendAtBernies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeekendAtBernies">Weekend at Bernies 2</a></em> was rated PG, despite essentially having the same setup and black comedy premise as the PG-13 original, and featuring a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedFreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedFreakOut">Naked Freak-Out</a> scene on top of that.
</li><li> In the UK, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatEverHappenedToBabyJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatEverHappenedToBabyJane">What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</a></em> was originally rated X (16+) in 1962 with cuts (to remove <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the sight of Jane kicking Blanche reduced to one kick</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elvira witnessing Blanche tied up in bed</span>). The film was given an 18 rating, uncut, in 1988 before being <em>severely</em> reduced to a 12 rating (again uncut) in 2004.
</li><li> When the director's cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildBunch">The Wild Bunch</a></em> was submitted to the MPAA in 1993, it got an NC-17 rating, <em>for the same content that caused it to get an R in 1969</em>. The release of this version was delayed for two years until it was granted an R on appeal because Warner Bros. refused to release NC-17 material at the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildWildWest">Wild Wild West</a></em> is rated PG in Australia, except for the state of South Australia, where it gets an M15+. As such, video and DVD boxes have <a class="urllink" href="http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?Article_ID=3711&amp;p=y">both ratings on the cover<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The famous 1939 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> has been rated PG, despite being a G-rated film for decades. It just applies to the 3D version, which amps up such scary scenes as the tornado sequence and all scenes featuring the Wicked Witch of the West to levels that may frighten some viewers (though, to be fair, those scenes were scary even before the days of modern 3D cinema).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse">X-Men: Apocalypse</a></em> was the first X-Men film to receive an MA15+ in Australia, despite featuring no more violence or mature content than previous X-Men films. However, the film suddenly appeared one day on the Australian Classification Board website appealed to an M, despite no formal appeal announcement or documents relating to an appeal, leaving many to wonder if 20th Century Fox slipped the board a little extra to get the M they wanted.
</li><li> In France, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cuties">Cuties</a></em> was classified for all audiences. However, for the rest of the world, due to its content, it is considered an adults-only film. Even countries like Japan, which has a more flexible rating system, rated the film R18+. In some Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador, the film was rated 16+. There is at least one country where the film was banned because of its content.

On the other hand, Mendelsohn felt that all three weren't as intense thematically than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaleficentMistressOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaleficentMistressOfEvil">Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</a></em>, which managed to secure a PG.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> was originally rated TV-MA (due to explicit language and jokes centered on racially offensive behavior) on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> before being moved down to a TV-14.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorPhil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorPhil">Dr. Phil</a></em> which showcased rather violent abuse had its age rating bumped from a "9" to a "16" on later airings in the Netherlands.

</li><li> More generally it seems to be completely random whether the home video releases of 1963-89 stories got a U or a PG rating. There are U rated stories which fans will tell you have much more horrific content than many stories that got PG. Over the years, there does seem to have been a trend to more restrictive rating. One of the most notorious examples was "Pyramids Of Mars", which got a U rating despite its extremely creepy atmosphere and extremely horrific moments (in particular Marcus Scarman's body suddenly and rapidly rotting after Sutekh stops possessing it).

</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGame2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGame2006">The Game (2006)</a></em> did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> to BET, all TV-PG episodes (mainly from the first two seasons) were re-rated TV-14.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> received an 'M' rating for its first season in New Zealand for 'supernatural themes'. Season 2 received a 'PG', despite no decrease in supernatural themes, it featuring mutants, killer worms, mummies, and living dolls among other creatures.
<ul><li> A similar thing happened in America when <em>Goosebumps</em> aired in reruns on Cartoon Network (during its disastrous CN Real era) and Discovery Family (back when it was called "The Hub"): when the show was on FOX as part of its FOX Kids line-up, the show was rated TV-Y7 for scary content. The reruns on Cartoon Network and The Hub were TV-PG (also for scary content, though there's also other content issues, like kid characters getting bullied and scenes of kid characters in danger).
</li><li> Over in the UK, <em>Goosebumps</em> is rated PG on television (even though some episodes are edited for horror content that goes beyond the PG level and scenes of dangerous behavior), except for the episode "The Werewolf of Fever Swamp", which is rated 12 for animal violence (the werewolf killing deer), moderate horror, and moderate threat.
</li></ul></li><li> Less Than Kind, a Canadian comedy-drama series, went from a PG rating to 18+ following a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CityTV">City TV</a> to HBO Canada in it's second season.

It just says it "may not suit the needs of todays pre-school children." Now, if you had watched these DVDs, youd know that the first episode includes a slow-moving, seven-minute segment on milking cows with droning, repetitious narration. Does that sound like the kind of thing todays kids would sit still for?
</div><div class="indent">Theres also a film sequence about unsupervised children playing in a construction site.

<ul><li> In Europe, the series has a 7+ rating, except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Trials and Tribulations</a></em>, which gets 12+.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  Dual Destinies</a></em> is rated "M" (17+) but doesn't really feature anything out of the ordinary for the series. There are gruesome murder scenes and twisted villains, yes, but the series was never shy about depicting such things earlier. The bump in rating could be linked to the courtroom bombing, whose scene shows a fairly intense moment of people desperately trying to escape before the room explodes and another scene near the game's end shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a young Athena covered in her mother's blood; most content has their content ratings spike if children and disturbing scenes are mixed together.</span>
</li><li> Despite receiving an M rating from the ESRB, <em>Dual Destinies</em> carries the same 12+ rating in the iOS App Store as previous games.
</li><li> The following game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em>, drops down to the previously-standard "T" (13+) rating, despite some scenes being explicitly more graphic than in <em>Dual Destinies</em>. Notably, the game's backstory features what is essentially genocide, several characters' deaths are depicted from their own perspective, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two characters get shot on-screen, one of them while on the witness stand</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The mobile <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> game "Time Tangle" is rated M in Australia for violence, despite not featuring any stronger violence than the PG-rated series or other apps from the series that were classified G/PG.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmongUs">Among Us</a></em> was originally rated PEGI 16 on the Google Play Store for "strong violence" based on the questionnaire method of rating. Upon the game's rise in popularity in 2020, it was formally rated by PEGI, who bumped it down to a PEGI 7 for mild violence. While the game does contain violent acts that are uncommon in a PEGI 7, the cartoonish nature of it convinced PEGI to give it a lower rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier">Atelier</a></em>:

Averted in other regions. Especially ridiculous considering the PS3 version released only two years prior with a very tame PG rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierMeruruTheApprenticeOfArland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierMeruruTheApprenticeOfArland">Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland</a></em> received a bump-up from an M to an MA15+ when rereleased as <em>Atelier Meruru Plus</em> despite identical content.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Burnout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Burnout">Burnout 3: Takedown</a></em> is rated T for Teen for "Mild Language, Mild Violence" despite the amount of "violence" (read: cars without humans in them smashing each other up) being on par with every other <em>Burnout</em> game, and while the "mild language" likely comes down to the (censored) licensed music, future Burnout games would have songs with far more conspicuous censorship and only get an E10+ rating. (For instance: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise">Burnout Paradise</a></em> prominently features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne">"Girlfriend"</a>, which in-game has a chorus that goes "Hell yeah, I'm the mother_______ princess!")

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosHead">Chaos;Head</a></em> is considered an 'all ages' novel by many websites, and carries a 15+ rating on its PC edition. However, the iOS and PSP versions were bumped up to a 17+ for unknown reasons, and the Xbox 360 and PS Vita an <strong>18+</strong>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClassOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClassOfHeroes">Class of Heroes 2</a></em> is a rare example where its physical packaging even carried two different ESRB ratings (the front cover read "E10+" but the manual read "T") - previously, the company releasing it had used the auto-rating tool and received a T rating for the game, however the ESRB later informed them the game would require an actual submission, upon which it very last minute received an E10+ rating.
</li><li> The game <em>Clubhouse Games</em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> is rated E by the ESRB in the Americas, 12+ by the PEGI in Europe, and PG by the OFLC in Australia. The higher ratings in the latter two regions are due to the nature of simulated gambling in some of the embedded games (the ESRB addressed this content as well, but didn't deem it a serious issue). The follow-up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClubhouseGamesFiftyOneWorldwideClassics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClubhouseGamesFiftyOneWorldwideClassics">51 Worldwide Classics</a></em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> has those same ratings, with the added notoriety that South Korea rated it <strong>18+</strong> (the country has strict laws pertaining gambling; in particular, casino gambling is banned).

Should be noted that the original features a man being executed right in front of you (among other things rendered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo">Full Motion Video</a>), infantry being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">crushed by tanks with an audible "SQUELCH"</a> as a gameplay mechanic, and very graphic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">deaths for units killed by fire.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrazyTaxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrazyTaxi">Crazy Taxi</a></em>'s sequels were bumped up to a 15+ from the original's 11+ by the ELSPA, despite being at the same level of content as the original.
</li><li> In Europe, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a> Hottest Party 5</em> (a.k.a. <em>Dance Dance Revolution II</em> in North America) was given a 3+ (equivalent to an ESRB E) by PEGI in most of Europe, except in the United Kingdom, where it was given a 16+ rating for "Violence". The culprit was a brief scene in one of the music videos which involved someone getting punched in the face.
</li><li> Inverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a></em> in Japan, which got a CERO rating of C (for ages 15 and up) as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a>'s D (for ages 17 and up) despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">Bloodier and Gorier</a> than its predecessor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBlood">even if all blood in the series is colored pink</a>). All later games, including the <em>Danganronpa 1.2 Reload</em> compilation of the first and second games, got a D rating, and America averts it by giving all games an M rating.

</li><li> Every game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> franchise to come out in Europe was rated 3+, with the exception of the last two: <em>Digimon Rumble Arena 2</em> and <em>Digimon World 4</em> both got a ratings bump to 12+ and a symbol on the back of the box citing violent content as the primary cause. It's speculated that the games didn't sell as well as previous games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">because of this</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> was altered for the 3DS version specifically to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avoid this trope</a>. The PS2 version originally had an A rating (All ages) in Japan, but by the time of the re-release, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">the same content would've warranted a higher rating</a>, so some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> outfits and violent scenes had to be altered to keep an A rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> received a K-A rating when it was first released. However, for its Australian release it was slapped with an M rating, the equivalent of the ESRB'S T or PEGI's 12+, for "crude humour and sexual references", even though the game contains an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> final boss babbling about how much "it hurts" as you're trying to kill it. It seems like the US has caught up to this as well, as the rating was bumped to T for the long-awaited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> Virtual Console release. The blood visible on the Mondo Mole/Guardian Digger and Plague Rat of Doom's sprites appear to be the primary culprit. Oddly, the ESRB had earlier rated a prospective Wii VC release E.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em> never received a proper NES release internationally, and wouldn't have had a rating to be changed even if it had been released since the ESRB didn't exist yet, but it had already been edited by Nintendo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorshipBureau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorshipBureau">Censorship Bureau</a> to tone down violence and sexual content, especially on the enemy sprites.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em> was rated "M" upon its original release in Australia for 'medium level animated violence'. It's rerelease/remaster in 2014 under the title <em>Fable Anniversary</em> was rated "R18+" in Australia for 'sexual activity related to incentives and rewards', AKA the in-game rewards for pairing with prostitutes (or prostituting yourself as a female player), which, while not present in the original, were present in its M-rated sequel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a></em> originally had its sex scenes censored for an M rating in North America for consoles, with only one limited-release PC edition being released with an AO rating. However, the remastered edition, which is fully uncensored, managed to receive an M rating from the ESRB.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightingVipers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightingVipers">Fighting Vipers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter">Virtua Fighter</a> 2</em> were rated T for their original Saturn releases.

This was probably due to the more realistic graphics in battles. For further confusion, the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em> is considerably darker in tone, yet it was rated E10+.

<ul><li> <em>Accent Core +</em> got an M rating despite all the previous games in the series getting a T. This one is particularly notable in that <em>Accent Core +</em> actually <em>removed</em> most of the blood in the game compared to previous entries, the only exception being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">Testament</a>. Weirdly, this only applies to the digital-only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> versions; the physical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes">Useful Notes</a>/Wii versions get the T rating.
</li><li> <em>Accent Core + R</em> was slapped with an M rating for its console release, though the PC version on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> didn't receive any rating. When the game was eventually ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Switch</a>, the game reverted to a T rating, for some reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime">A Hat in Time</a></em> was rated E10+ for digital release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> 4 and Xbox One for over a year. However, when the game was rated for a physical/digital release for the Nintendo Switch, it was rerated T for a scene with a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fake pool of blood</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature">Harvest Moon: Back to Nature</a></em> was rated E, as was its Gameboy Advance remake, <em>Friends of Mineral Town</em>. Its next remake, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasonsFriendsOfMineralTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasonsFriendsOfMineralTown">Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</a></em> is rated E10+. According to the ESRB listing, the difference is due to risque dialog in a TV show that either wasn't in the original releases or was censored by Natsume. It's also possible that this was due to the fact that E10+ rating didn't exist when the originals came out.
</li><li> While the console version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatofulBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatofulBoyfriend">Hatoful Boyfriend</a></em> is rated M in Australia for "violent themes", the mobile port, which was rated through the IARC questionnaire, is rated PG for "mild sexual references". The mobile port's rating is somewhat baffling since, of the three sexual references in the game, only one of them can be reached without having <em>also</em> encountered a rather large amount of violence earlier in the same route - and that one is in a route which contains violent themes and a reference to genocide later on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2">Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2</a></em> had one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">pedophile</a> villain. This was cited as the main reason to bump it up to M from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptunia">Hyperdimension Neptunia</a></em> (rated T). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory">Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory</a></em> no longer features him, and thus the game's rating is back to T despite the presence of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix">dominatrix</a> goddess. Averted with Re;birth's 2 T rating as said villain being as much as a perv as he was in the original with the inclusion of a CG depicting him licking Rom and Ram. <em>mk2</em> was also officially rated 10 in Brazil, however carries an <strong>18</strong> rating on the PlayStation Store for unknown reasons.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> copies in the UK carry an "OK 11+" label. Later copies will carry the game's PEGI rating, a downgrade to a PEGI 7.

Granted the steps to even encounter Zero include some rather extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moments making it very possible they weren't even aware of its existence. Upon the release of <em>Kirby's Dream Collection</em>, the ESRB finally caught onto this and gave it an E10+ rating for "Animated Blood".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand">Kirby's Return to Dream Land</a></em>, also known as <em>Kirby Wii</em>, is the first game in the <em>Kirby</em> series to have an E10+ rating, but it's hardly more violent than any other game in the series. The Japanese version averted this by having it rated A, which is the E rating for Japan. This would mean that either the Japanese or the Americans are missing something with this game. The same thing applies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies">Kirby Star Allies</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>: E. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Ocarina of Time 3D</a></em>: E10+. Violent or sexual content that changed: Almost nil. If anything, there's <em>less</em> sexual content; the perpetually nude female character, Ruto, was updated to look more like she's wearing something, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> carpenters had one of their lines altered to make it sound less like they were hitting on Link. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBlood">the blood Ganondorf coughs up is still colored green</a>, as it has been all versions after the original gold cartridge version. The updated graphics <em>might</em> have had something to do with it (making it seem more "real"), but it's anyone's guess. During the N64 era, the E10+ rating did not exist so this was likely the intended rating all along. In addition, Suggestive Themes was listed and involves the semi-nude Great Fairy. The remakes of the E-rated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasmask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasmask">Majora's Mask</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em> were rated E10+ as well, but this time all original content remains intact. Again, this is due to the E10+ rating not existing when the games were first released.
</li><li> A collection released containing the first two games along with <em>Majora's Mask</em> and <em>Ocarina of Time</em> was rated PEGI 7 when originally released all together. When <em>Majora's Mask</em> and <em>Ocarina of Time</em> were rereleased for Wii/3DS, they were both bumped up to a PEGI 12.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em> go into the halfway mark with an E10+ rating. <em>Skyward Sword</em> was rated M in Australia (M being the equivalent of ESRB's Teen).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em> harkens back to the E-rated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>, but contains content and themes on par with other modern <em>Zelda</em> games, which are rated E10+ for the most part. It still got an E rating just like its predecessor, possibly due to the top-down perspective and graphics making the violence less realistic, although this still brings into question why its rating is lower than <em>Spirit Tracks</em> (which has similar visuals and perspective).
</li><li> The Grezzo remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em> is rated E or its equivalent everywhere, like the original, except in Japan, where it was slapped with a B rating and a descriptor for "Crime." Presumably, stealing from an item shop fits this regardless of the consequences.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo">Limbo</a></em> was originally given an 18 rating in Europe when it was released on the PS3, 360 and PC. However, when it was released on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita">PlayStation Vita</a>, it only got a 16 rating, while the aforementioned versions remain 18-rated. Furthermore, the game was rated 12 by the BBFC in the UK (at the tail end of the BBFC's days of rating video games), which means that there are 12-rated <em>and</em> 18-rated copies of the game floating around on store shelves in the UK.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em> was originally given a K-A rating by the newly-formed ESRB. The remake got a T rating. In this case, the original game had caught a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">What Do You Mean, It's Not for Kids?</a>, with partial nudity, swearing, plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, and voyeurism in a game with cute anime graphics. A more experienced ESRB rated the remake appropriately.
</li><li> On a higher maturity level, the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Manhunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Manhunt">Manhunt</a></em> was rated M. The second game in the series had to have cuts to keep it M and not AO, but what information has leaked about those cuts indicates that they were all things present in the first game. The original game also initially was released with an MA15+ in Australia, and kept this rating for almost a year on shelves, before a forced review by the Attorney-General got the game banned.
</li><li> <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection 2</em> and <em>Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 + 2</em> were given an E10+ and T rating, respectively, despite all of the games in the compilations having been rated E beforehand. According to the ESRB's website, the animated FMV cutscenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8">Mega Man 8</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em> are the primary reason for the rating increases.
</li><li> In the UK, the PS1 and PC versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> got an 18+ rating. When the GameCube remake <em>The Twin Snakes</em> came out, it got a 15+ rating, despite the violence being more intense in this version (for starters, we actually see Gray Fox killing the people in the hallway). Then when the PS1 version came to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationNetwork">PlayStation Network</a>, it still kept its 18+ rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition</a></em> was a similar case in Australia, with the original being rated M for "animated violence", and the Enhanced Edition's rating being all over the place. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.classification.gov.au/search/title?search=neverwinter+nights&amp;sort_by=search_api_relevance">If this page is any indication<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the same game was rated PG for "Mild Violence, Sexualised Imagery, Scary Scenes, Online Interactivity", <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MA15" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MA15">MA 15</a>+ for "Strong Violence, Online Interactivity" and R18+ for "Sexual activity related to incentives and rewards, online interactivity". Oddly enough, the ESRB rated the console versions M (for blood and gore and sexual content) while the original version was given a T rating despite having the same amount of blood and gore and sexual content. As further complications, the PC version of the Enhanced Edition is <em>still</em> rated T.
</li><li> The 25th anniversary re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap">Night Trap</a></em> bumped the games rating down from an M (for "Realistic Violence") to a T (for "Violence, Blood, Suggestive Themes"). It should be noted this game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">was what kickstarted the formation of the ESRB</a>, being one of the first games to be rated M and sparking high controversy during its original release for supposedly "promoting" violence against women. In actuality, the "violence" in the game was deliberately made cartoonish and over-the-top, and the controversial bathroom scene (which actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">reprimands you if you dont save the girl</a>) is very tame by todays standards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a> FES</em> was rated M in Australia, but <em>Persona 3 Portable</em> was rated MA (equivalent of M, and a restricted category).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a> 3</em> got a bump up in the US and in Europe, from the last game's E/3+ to E10+/7+ respectively. It's barely different from its two predecessors, other than a slightly darker plot, and even has the same ESRB content descriptor of Mild Cartoon Violence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em> initially received a PEGI rating of 3 in Europe. For their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> rereleases, they were bumped up to a 12 because of the Game Corner slot machines, which are retained in spite of the PEGI guidelines prohibiting gambling in the typical 3 and 7 ratings <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> games go for (the same reason Game Corners are absent in all games from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black/White</a></em> onwards).
</li><li> Inverted in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em>, which was noticeably darker than the previous game in the series (which wasn't all that sunny to begin with) and yet actually received a <em>lower</em> ESRB rating than its predecessor - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal1">Portal</a></em> is rated T, <em>2</em> got an E10+. The only reason the ESRB rated this one lower was because this one didn't have blood, while the blood in the first game was the only factor that resulted in the ESRB giving it a higher rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabbidsGoHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabbidsGoHome">Rabbids Go Home</a></em> was actually planned to be recalled after only a few weeks on the market in Europe due to its content being reevaluated. However, it only ended up receiving a new cover with a PEGI 12 rating as opposed to a 7.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> Collection</em>; Originally, the first three games were rated T, but their HD remakes for the PS3 are all marked with an E10+, putting them in line with the rest of the series. (The games were released before the E10+ rating was introduced, and the first one is actually the tamest one in the series.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReadOnlyMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReadOnlyMemories">Read Only Memories</a></em> was initially rated M by the ESRB, however was rerated T when ported to consoles. The main difference in the ratings descriptions for the two ratings is "Strong Language" and "Mild Language", despite a character named Starfucker being present in both. It was <em>again</em> rerated as M after the developer was attacked by trolls due to his political beliefs on Twitter; one of the things these trolls did was complain about the presence of the F-word in a T-rated game, officially getting the ESRB to review and once again rerate the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Roundabout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Roundabout">Roundabout</a></em> was rerated from a T to an M by the ESRB upon them holding a playtest session. This was due to the "volume of blood" - the same amount they had previously seen and were okay with in the submitted videos. Also added was a "Use of Drugs" advisory due to a few jokes about the game's candy being drugs (it's clarified that it's not), which was also in all previous versions with no advisory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4">Rune Factory 4</a></em>, when originally released for the Nintendo 3DS, was rated E10+ by the ESRB for "Fantasy Violence, Language, Mild Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol". Upon being ported to the Nintendo Switch in the "Special" edition, it was rerated T for "Fantasy Violence, <em>Mild</em> Language, Mild Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol". As many were surprised by the E10+ rating for the original version due to its frequent mild swearing and sexual innuendo, it appears the ESRB decided their original decision was a bit too lenient.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars2019">Sakura Wars (2019)</a></em> has a C rating (15+) in Japan, an 18+ rating in South Korea, an M rating in Australia, a PEGI 16 rating in Europe, a USK 12 rating in Germany and a T rating in North America.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura">Senran Kagura</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the games in the franchise, with the exception of <em>Burst</em> (which was a bit tamer and got a T rating in the US), are identical in objectionable content (ridiculous amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>, innuendo, a handful of swears, etc). Despite this, they range from the unrestricted M category (<em>Burst</em>, <em>Shinovi Versus</em>) to MA15+ (<em>Deep Crimson</em>, <em>Bon Appetit!</em>)' and later all the way up to R18+ (<em>Estival Versus</em>, <em>Peach Beach Splash</em>) in Australia.
</li><li> A similarly jumping around in ratings for the games has occurred in Germany: one game (<em>Deep Crimson</em>) received a USK 12 rating, while every other game had received a USK 16 rating...up until <em>Peach Beach Splash</em>, which received a USK 18 rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a></em>:
<ul><li> An interesting case, as the content is all the same but the graphics in each one continue to increase, making the figures of the half-naked girls sexier as you can see more detail. The first Shantae was originally an E before moving into an E10+ for the next two games. <em>Half-Genie Hero</em> finally jumped up to a T rating, gaining it the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> of "Rated T for Tits". <em>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</em> dropped again to an E10+ rating, despite not being particularly less frisky than its predecessor.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> was rated T on its console, PC, and 3DS versions. Its iOS versions were rated 9+ (which is the Apple equivalent to the E10+ rating).

Modern-day re-releases of them are E10+, though Sega's VRC ratings system never had an equivalent rating.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> was rated B (ages 12 and up) in Japan, PEGI 7 in Europe, PG in Australia and E10+ in North America despite the content of this game being no different from any other <em>Mario</em> game, and in some areas being <em>less</em> explicit than what was seen in previous, E-rated games (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">the death and rebirth of the entire universe and Rosalina losing her parents</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">a villain plotting to destroy every universe simultaneously out of grief and a young girl transforming into an enormous spider-like monster in a process that apparently involves breaking her neck</a>, etc.) The presence of realistically-designed characters and creatures may have been a factor, but nothing in the game moves beyond slapstick territory.
</li><li> Subverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7">Mario Kart 7</a></em> - while the final cut is given an ESRB rating of E like the rest of the series, pre-release trailers show that it was originally prepped to have an E10+ despite the sole content descriptor being "Comic Mischief".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party 10</a></em> received a PEGI 7 in Europe for "violence that is set in a cartoon, slapstick or child like setting". All previous games were rated PEGI 3 and carried the exact same violence label.
</li><li> In Australia, the four <em>Mario Party</em> instalments for the GameCube, as well as <em>Advance</em> and <em>DS</em>, received a G8+/PG rating for "mild gambling references". Every other game in the series received a G rating.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">original game</a> for Nintendo 64 was rated E. Its sequels, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>, are both rated T, despite having the same level of violence as the original (no blood, no gore, just characters getting smacked around and sent flying). However, some of the sound effects in the first game were replaced with more cartoony ones when the game was released outside of Japan. The higher rating was because the graphics of <em>Melee</em> and <em>Brawl</em> were more realistic than the original. For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, the rating drops to E10+, despite having <em>even more</em> detailed graphics, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">horrifying</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">Family-Unfriendly Violence</a> in <em>Ultimate</em>'s case. Some people hypothesize that <em>Melee</em> would have gotten E10+ as well, had that rating existed at the time, but this doesn't explain <em>Brawl</em>.
</li><li> In the UK, <em>Melee</em> got 3+ while <em>Brawl</em> got 12+.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">DK Rap</a> originated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>, with a line about Chunky Kong declaring, "He may move slow; he can't jump high / But this Kong's one <em>hell</em> of a guy!" The game is rated E (in England, where Rareware, the producers of <em>DK64</em>, is located, "hell" is considered appropriate at the U rating). In <em>Melee</em>, this line had the minor alteration from "<em>hell</em> of a guy" to "<em>heck</em> of a guy", presumably to clean up the language to be suitable for all audiences, and in response to angry parents who complained to Nintendo about use of the word "hell". <em>Melee</em> is rated T; a single instance of the word "hell" would be well within the bounds of the T rating. And when <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> was released on the Wii U Virtual Console, it stayed rated E despite the lyrics being unchanged.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em> tie-in video game, <em>Victorious: Taking the Lead</em> is E10+ primarily for the inclusion of the flirtatious "Take a Hint" (the ESRB mentions the lyrics "You should that we should hook up, but I think that we should not" and "Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips/Stop your staring at myhey!"). However, these lyrics were allowed to be heard in the G-rated TV show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Voez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Voez">Voez</a></em> was temporarily pulled from the Nintendo eShop in the US and rerated from E for Everyone to T for "Mild Blood, Partial Nudity" in regards to some previously overlooked content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> was originally rated T by the ESRB for its beta release, but was switched to an M later on. Gore and dismemberment were present in the game from the beginning, but became more prominent with further updates.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a> Gold</em> was rated E10+ despite no significant differences in content between any of the series previous E-rated installments - including the exact same descriptors as <em>Twisted</em> and <em>Touched</em> (Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor) and an ESRB rating summary that cites some of the <em>exact</em> same microgames as previous entries. <em>Smooth Moves</em> was rated E10+, but that had some slightly edgier minigames that bumped up the rating.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhiteKnightChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhiteKnightChronicles">White Knight Chronicles</a></em> was rated 16 for "Violence" and "Drug Use". The sequel included the entire first game on the disc, but only came in at a 12 for "Violence" and "Bad Language".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> games seem to vary on the mood of whoever is rated them at the ESRB or PEGI, as they range from E to E10+/PEGI 3 to PEGI 7 despite no differences in content. Later games in the series were rated <em>T for Teen</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Zone of the Enders</a></em> has been all over the place. It originally received an M rating from the ESRB solely because of a <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> demo, so it makes sense that a reissue without it would be rated T. However, this reissue also bumped the game up from a PG to an M in Australia, <em>downgraded</em> it from an R16 to an M in New Zealand, and bumped it up from a 16 to an 18 in Germany.
</li><li> App developer Ambition has two otome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a> games, one with still images called <em>Animal Boyfriend</em>, and one with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Live2D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Live2D">Live 2 D</a> animation called <em>Dream Boyfriend</em>. <em>Animal Boyfriend</em> is rated 3+ on the App Store and E10+ on Google Play for use of tobacco, while <em>Dream Boyfriend</em> carries a T rating on both stores for suggestive themes, the only real difference between the two games being whether or not there's animation, and if anything, <em>Animal Boyfriend</em> features more skimpy and suggestive outfits than <em>Dream Boyfriend</em> does. Similarly its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> <em>Dream Girlfriend</em> has a T rating on the Play Store but a whopping 17+ rating on the App Store, though averted with the non-animated counterpart <em>Moe Can Change</em> as it has an all ages rating on both stores, and actually is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamerAndChaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamerAndChaster">Tamer and Chaster</a> with a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">Puni Plush</a> art style.
</li><li> The changing over of the PEGI system from the BBFC in the United Kingdom has led to several ratings jumps. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, originally rated 12 by the BBFC, is now legally rated 18 in the UK by PEGI.

This was somewhat of an underrating from the beginning, but after a few seasons, the show's content (mostly comic violence, suggestive humor, dangerous behavior, and scenes that may be too scary or disturbing for younger viewers) escalated beyond what most of the show's American counterparts<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note192l04');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note192l04" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note192l04');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">remember, <em>Gumball</em> is a British show, so some of this may come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a></span> would allow. It should be noted that the DVD releases of <em>Gumball</em> in the United Kingdom are PG for the same things that net it a Y7 on American TV (crude humor, scary, disturbing scenes; comic threat and violence; dangerous behavior, and, in the case of the season five episode "The Worst", references to sexism and age discrimination).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>'s first two episodes, "Pilot", and "Threat Levels", were rated TV-PG when they first premiered.

This was likely due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a listing for "Rabbot" being used as a cover for the <em>Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever</em> finale "The Greatest Story Ever Told", which actually <em>did</em> carry the latter rating.</span>
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> airs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CityTV">CityTV</a>, it is rated 14+ and carries a rather long (and mostly unwarranted) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarning">Content Warning</a>, but when it airs on the Canadian version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">AdultSwim</a>, it is rated PG and does not carry any sort of warning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em> was rated 18+ by Teletoon when originally broadcast in Canada, but only received a 14A in Manitoba for its complete DVD set.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgers">Duck Dodgers</a></em> was originally rated TV-G (which is the default rating for most Looney Tunes-based TV shows and the classic shorts) on Cartoon Network. As time went on, it was changed to a TV-Y7 for fantasy violence (FV) rating despite no changes in content. This is the rating it has when it airs reruns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> premiered in 2001 with a TV-Y rating (back when that rating wasn't restricted to preschool shows), and then went up to a TV-Y7 around the same time <em>[SpongeBob]</em> did (though some reruns of some older episodes keep the Y rating, usually by accident).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Hungary, the series went from an initial rating of 16+ to 12+, and being aired early in the afternoon, then right back to 16+ with a strict night-only time slot. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">abundance of uncensored swear words in the dubbing</a> may have had something to do with it (besides the original content, of course). Strangely, the even more vulgar dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2161yd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2161yd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2161yd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(even though <em>King of the Hill</em> in its original American English version isn't all that vulgar. Yes, there is some offensive language — mostly Hank telling someone that he's gonna kick their ass — and a lot of dialogue and scenes that are suggestive of adult themes, but it's about as "vulgar" and "adult" as a family-friendly 1980s sitcom — which is, to say, not very, but some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">crap does slip by</a>)</span> didn't get pushed back; they instead gave it an earlier afternoon air-time, with reruns being shown early in the morning, and the TV station doesn't supply any information on the rating. This might be because the channel it airs on (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Viasat6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Viasat6">Viasat 6</a>) is broadcast from England, so the ratings don't have to conform to Hungarian policies — it could even be that the people in charge didn't even <em>realize</em> that the dub contained such crude language. Nevertheless, the swearing was abandoned in the second half of the series, possibly as a response to this.
</li><li> Several episodes have been rated TV-MA when aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>, including "I Take Thee Quagmire"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note223jdo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note223jdo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note223jdo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for the scene of Joan threatening to kill herself if Quagmire divorces her and the subplot about Lois' breasts</span>, "The Father, the Son and the Holy Fonz"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23p0u6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23p0u6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23p0u6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for its take on religion, particularly Stewie's line after seeing Francis put a crucifix in the kitchen "Nothing says 'Eat up' like a skinny Jew nailed to a piece of wood," which was cut on FOX for being blasphemous</span>, "Peter's Two Dads"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24ap29');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24ap29" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24ap29');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for Francis getting crushed to death, Peter smoking crack to stop drinking, Stewie becoming masochistic and wanting Lois to beat him, and the racist humor about Irish people being drunks</span>, and "Family Gay"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25i3ah');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25i3ah" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25i3ah');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for the references to the racehorse being mentally retarded and the crude humor centered on homosexuality, including a scene where Peter snaps out of it when he's in an all-male orgy</span>. These episodes have since been re-rated TV-14.
</li><li> Every episode on [adult swim] that was rated TV-PG was re-rated to TV-14 except for "Peter Got Woods".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS">TBS</a> re-rates some of the earlier episodes to a TV-PG rating with sub-labels despite being TV-14 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> and the aformentioned [adult swim].
</li><li> Some episodes of the first three seasons, such as "Death Has a Shadow", "A Fish Out of Water", "Road to Europe", and "Wasted Talent" were rated TV-PG when they first aired on FOX. They are now TV-14 in all reruns.
</li><li> Hulu formerly had the entire fifth season (as well as some fourth season episodes) marked as TV-MA, even though they use the FOX TV versions, which are edited for content (Season 4 is actually mostly uncensored). This appears to have been fixed, as they all carry a TV-14 rating now. Season 5 episodes still have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings">Content Warnings</a> at the beginning, though.
<ul><li> Strangely, the episode "Peter's Got Woods" was initially rated TV-PG on Hulu. As the rest of Season 4 had its episodes' ratings adjusted, the episode went all the way up to a TV-MA.

Starting with season 2, and most likely future seasons, the show became rated TV-PG.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Originally a TV-PG on FOX (the only TV-14-rated episodes that aired on FOX were "A Fishful Of Dollars", "A Tale of Two Santas" and "Spanish Fry"; the first due to language, the second one due to violence, the latter due to sex and sexually-suggestive dialogue and situations), was rated TV-14 when rerun on Comedy Central and on local station affiliates in America.

"Leela's Homeworld", however, was rated U<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31aitf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31aitf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31aitf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">suitable for all ages</span> by the BBFC when released on DVD, despite the episode containing fleeting references to sexual spanking, scenes of the Planet Express crew being threatened by mutants, scenes of body horror, the central theme of child abandonment, the climax of Leela freaking out over her parents' alleged death and nearly murdering the couple who turn out to be her parents, and the tear-jerking ending. In contrast, this episode was rated TV-PG on American television (and on Hulu Plus) for suggestive dialogue (D) when it premiered on FOX and reran on Cartoon Network. On Comedy Central and Netflix, all of the episodes (including this one) are rated TV-14 (unsuitable for viewers under 14 years old), regardless of whether or not the show's content is strong enough for that rating.
</li><li> Hulu in general is often inconsistent with <em>Futurama</em>'s ratings. Many pre-cancellation episodes carry a TV-14, even though they originally aired with a TV-PG. Conversely, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> episodes are given a TV-PG rating, including some of the raunchier episodes like "In a Gadda da Leela".
</li></ul></li><li> Despite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> airing with a TV-Y7 rating on television (though it was one of those shows that premiered back before America created the TV ratings system), the DVD releases are rated on Right Stuf as suitable for ages 12+.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em> changed ratings in Canada upon its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a> - YTV aired the first two seasons with a PG rating, while Teletoon afterwards aired the show with an 18+ rating despite no difference in content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em> also went from a TV-Y to a Y7 like the previous two mentioned, but it didn't take as long as the other two. The show premiered in 1996 without a rating (as the television ratings were not put into use yet), and when the television ratings were introduced in 1997, it was given a TV-Y. When the second season premiered in October of the same year, it went up to a Y7, and even had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings">content warning</a> at the beginning until 1998 due to it being one of the <em>very few</em> Nick shows at the time with a Y7 rating (Not counting the shows which would be TV-Y or TV-G and then go up a rating for reruns). The stand-alone specials would switch off between a Y and Y7 rating- <em>Life With Loopy Birthday Gala-Bration</em> (1998) and <em>The Off-Beats Valentine's</em> (1999) had a Y7, while <em>The Henry and June Show</em> (later in 1999) had a Y.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts">Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts</a></em>: Despite being rated TV-Y7-FV in America and similarly elsewhere around the world, the Singaporean version of Netflix gave the show a baffling <em>M18</em> rating<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note328tl5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note328tl5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note328tl5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Equivalent to the R or TV-MA rating in America</span>. This is most likely due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Benson saying that he was gay in episode 6</span> and countries like Singapore not being as accepting or tolerant of homosexuality, especially if it's in a children's cartoon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Looney Tunes Golden Collection</em> DVD series from volume three to its last one (volume six) contained a "Recommended for mature cartoon collectors" rating, as a lot of the cartoons they started putting on the sets contained a lot of cartoons that featured outdated racial, ethnic, and even sexual stereotypes (mostly women being portrayed as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> or nagging shrews, though some of the pre-Hays Code 1930s shorts do have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> stereotypes). This would also apply to most DVD sets of other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a>-owned cartoons from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation">The Golden Age of Animation</a>, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery">Tex Avery</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TexAveryMGMCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TexAveryMGMCartoons">MGM filmography</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicStrip">Comic Strip</a>/Popeye shorts.
</li><li> When the <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts aired on American TV following the introduction of the TV ratings system in the mid-1990s, they would carry a TV-Y rating on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB">Kids' WB!</a>, and most free-to-air channels.

On HBO Max, however, the shorts would range from being TV-Y7 (not recommended for children under 7) to TV-G (suitable for all ages) to TV-PG (suitable for all ages, but parents may want to watch with their kids), the latter rating of which is more for the cartoon shorts that have content that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>, but is now considered offensive (mostly outdated racial stereotypes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33hme4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note33hme4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33hme4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though HBO Max doesn't have the Censored Eleven or any of the more controversial WWII shorts, like "Tokio Jokio" or "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips"</span>, suggestive humor, or violence that goes beyond comic slapstick, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAsComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAsComedy">suicide gags</a>, anything that's considered dangerous if copied in real life, or the physical child abuse shown in Chuck Jones' Three Bears cartoons).

When the show came to Amazon Prime, it was bumped up to a <strong>TV-14</strong>, most likely because some sketches include bleeped-out profanity (some of which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensoredForComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensoredForComedy">Censored for Comedy</a>).
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMrMenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMrMenShow">The Mr. Men Show</a></em> first aired, it was rated TV-Y. By the second season, it was bumped to TV-Y7. Why it changed is never stated, though it's speculated that the sound effects for Mr. Rude's flatulence changed from normal honks to actual passing gas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse">The Owl House</a></em> is a TV-Y7 rated show that has quite a bit of LGBTQ content, mainly the teasing of a romantic relationship between two girls, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luz and Amity</span>, as well as pictures of Willow that show she has two dads. Other countries that are less tolerant of LGBTQ content bump up the age rating, such as Indonesia giving it a 17+ rating, which is the equivalent of TV-MA.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> (the original one from 1998) was always rated TV-Y7 for fantasy violence (FV). When the DVD of the original series came out, it was branded "PG" for the inclusion of the Whoopass Girls short.
</li><li> A few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">The Powerpuff Girls (2016)</a></em> carry a TV-PG rating on Hulu, despite carrying a TV-Y7 rating on Cartoon Network. The fact that a large number of 2010s Cartoon Network programs <em>were</em> rated TV-PG might have something to do with it.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> first premiered in the mid-1990s, it was TV-Y (suitable for young children. These days, this rating is only used for TV shows made for preschoolers, like Nick Jr.'s line-up, Disney Junior's lineup, and most of PBS's kids shows). When the show began reruns on Toon Disney, the rating was changed to TV-G, though Disney Channel still showed it with a TV-Y rating. Disney XD switched back to TV-Y when they aired repeats for a week in October 2011 (despite airing the show as TV-G when it was in regular reruns from 2009-2010), while the Disney+ release went up to a TV-Y7 rating.

Reruns on other channels gave it a more proper A (all ages) rating.
</li><li> In the US, the show carried a TV-Y rating for the original run from 1997 on (as all episodes prior premiered before the ratings were put into use), however when the show began airing on TeenNick as part of The '90s Are All That and The Splat, the show was given a TV-G.

</li><li> A strange example: "The Wreck of the Relationship" is, to date, the only <em>The Simpsons</em> episode to get a TV-MA rating (at least on Simpsons World, while the censored version has a TV-14), due to an uncensored (albeit brief) instance of a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird">Flipping the Bird</a> in the beginning of the episode.

</li><li> Over in America, <em>South Park</em> outside of its 10:00pm showings carries a TV-14 rating, though not because changing times have rendered the more subversive scenes harmless.

In the case of cable channels, it depends on what the target demographic of the cable channel is or if advertisers want to err on the cautious side.
</li><li> A collection of <em>South Park</em> entitled "Insults to Injuries" which featured episodes previously rated 14A was bumped up to an R rating for unknown reasons in Manitoba.
</li><li> Around Summer 2017, Comedy Central re-rated most episodes from Seasons 1-20 South Park from TV-MA to TV-14-DLSV, with the exception of particularly controversial episodes such as "Trapped In The Closet" (due to gun violence from R. Kelly, the innuendo about Tom Cruise being gay, and the general mocking of Scientology) and "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson" (due to racist content). Unlike the syndicated edition, which was also rated TV-14, these episodes are not edited for content.

</li><li> Over in Russia, the series was rated 12+ (the Russian equivalent of TV-PG) on TNT and Nickelodeon Russia. Yet when SpongeBob airs on 2x2, however, it has a 16+ rating (the Russian equivalent of TV-14, which is reserved for the adult animated shows, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>, amongst others), despite no changes in content.

In repeats (especially on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>), it's TV-Y7-FV, despite no changes to the content.
</li><li> The short-lived, obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> series "Where My Dogs At?" originally aired with a TV-PG rating, despite having strong language, numerous sexual situations, and the two central canine protagonists, having <em>very</em> prominent and visible anuses <em>and</em> testicles. When the show was briefly put into reruns, the rating was changed to a much more appropriate TV-14-DL rating.
</li><li> Although the DC Extended Universe (above) is an interesting case of the differences between the MPAA and the BBFC, it is not without precedent, as most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a> has a similar discrepancy in ratings. Several films in the franchise with PG-13 ratings in the US are given 15s in the UK due to their level of violence, despite being animated. Even some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> have obtained 12 ratings, despite airing with TV-Y7-FV ratings on American television.
