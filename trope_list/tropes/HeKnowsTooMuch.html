No matter what bad guy was involved, somebody saw it all, heard it all, or somehow caught wind of what's going down (or what went down), and the bad guy in question has found out about the witness.
</p><p>Since the witness now knows too much, the bad guy's entire scheme may come crashing down, so they aim to "silence" the witness in some manner, through bribery, blackmail, intimidation, or even murder.
</p><p>A common variant is that the person who purportedly knows too much doesn't actually know anything at all (or at least, doesn't understand what knowledge they have)  but the overly paranoid conspirators believe that they do, thus leading to their campaign of persecution. There's a good chance the hero will eventually get sick of being relentlessly hounded/threatened/shot at by the conspirators and start fighting back. In the process, they usually learn the "real" secret anyway by constantly coming into contact with said conspirators at every turn and eventually will find a way to bring the plan to ruin. The ironic conclusion, of course, is that if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealingCoverup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealingCoverup">had just relaxed and left the person alone, they'd have succeeded</a>.

</p><p>Another, less sympathetic variation occurs when a character learns a guilty secret possessed by another character and decides it would be a profitable enterprise to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">blackmail</a> the second character in exchange for their silence. This one usually overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>, since the second character understandably won't like the idea of being on the hook to a sleazy blackmailer for the rest of their life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire">and is likely to decide that getting rid of the blackmailer will cost them less in the long run than paying up</a>.

He faked being masochistic and suffering amnesia in order to avoid this fate. (He pretended to have forgotten about the torture and be only worried someone could find out that he sometimes pays women to inflict pain on him.) It worked, probably due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a> villains who thought they were in a detective novel, where leaving the potential witness alive would indeed be cleverer.

The Motie decision makers decide to kill them to keep them from telling the other humans what they've found out. And it plays out the other way, too. The humans are about to be captured, but they decide that they know too much about human technology to allow themselves to be taken prisoner — so they kill themselves.

</li><li> Joyce Reynolds, the 13-year-old schoolgirl from "Hallowe'en Party" (1969). She tries to use her knowledge of a murder to her benefit.

</li><li> An example of the second variant comes in <em>Why Didn't They Ask Evans?</em>.

He began doing this to other people and managed to move up in life as a result. However, things escalated to the point the man was cornered by hitmen at his beach house and murdered... because of this trope.
</li><li> A short story in <em>The Best in Chess</em> revolves around a cobbler who claims to have discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">an unbeatable chess opening</a>, thereby rendering all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> theory—and the game itself—obsolete.

<ul><li> In 1805-1809, the American government <em>tried</em> to have Aaron Burr assassinated for this reason. Altogether, the effort cost about two-million dollars in modern terms and resulted in a short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot">military dictatorship</a> being installed in New Orleans and hundreds of arrests and imprisonments. It also <em>nearly</em> resulted in war with England and Spain, the destruction of the SCOTUS and a whole lot more power being transferred to the office of the President—however, the whole ordeal was ultimately unsuccessful, and after Thomas Jefferson's presidency ended, the ensuing government declined to continue it.
</li><li> In 1942, the Russians arranged an assassination of Von Papen, the German ambassador to Turkey. They gave the would-be assassin a package which they said was a smoke bomb to cover his escape. The assassin decided that attacking under cover of the smoke was a better plan and so set it off early: it exploded killing the assassin but leaving von Papen unharmed except for the gore splattered on his suit. The Russians of course intended him to do this after shooting the target, thus preventing him from telling who was the guilty party.
<ul><li> This gambit was also used by Irish terrorist groups, such as the Provisional IRA, to eliminate members whose trust was in doubt, those suspected of being double agents for British security services. Terrorists in this position might be instructed to drive a car bomb to a certain location. But the bomb would be on a short fuse and explode long before they got there. It is suspected that British Intelligence exploited this by deliberately planting doubts in the IRA leadership's mind as to the reliability of certain members, thus eliminating terrorists, without the irksome need of proving a case that would stand up in court.
