</p><p>When a villain declares that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a>, or that his mentor is using him, or that his girlfriend doesn't love him, or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">his long-lost father is actually the villain himself</a>, the hero often believes it, instead of just assuming that the villain is trying to screw with him. Even if the hero does assume that, the doubts in the back of his mind start to gnaw.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Also, the villain is usually telling the truth, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance">something</a> that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">"technically" true</a>, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">certain values of "true"</a>, anyway  there are only a few cases where the villain just makes something up for giggles. This is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Break Them by Talking</a> works.
</p><p>This can often leave you wondering why the hero is suddenly carrying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and believing the villain rather than his trusted companion. Or even believing anything the villain would say without having 50 sworn trustworthy witnesses to back it up. Of course, it becomes a lot more justified if the villain's general truthfulness has already been previously established.
</p><p>As an alternative, sometimes the statement is actually true, but only by failing to take into account the personalities and feelings of others. As an example, perhaps the hero is told, in an effort to convert him to the villain's side, that they are in fact the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a> (which given the nature of the story is actually true), and that their girlfriend will <em>never</em> love them (which is <strong>not</strong> true, since the girlfriend in question has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">already found out</a> about his status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a>, and perhaps for <em>any other person</em> this would be true, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakinessShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakinessShame">but the girlfriend loves this about him</a>). Expect this character to be strung along for quite a few episodes before they find out this latter part.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> on the other hand may use this trope out of principle, feeling that the hero has heard enough lies and deserves the truth from them.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher">The Butcher</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> Barry the Chopper in is one of the rare "making it up for the giggles" examples: He uses an entirely improvised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">Hannibal Lecture</a> on Al, and Al falls for it in all three versions of the story. Justified in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime</a>, where Alphonse is shown to be questioning his existence for several episodes beforehand, and Barry just happened to get lucky with the subject matter. In the manga, however, it is not foreshadowed, and it leads to an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Out-of-Character Moment</a> for Alphonse. He doesn't dwell on it for as long as his anime counterpart, however.
</li><li> Played straight with Greed, who insists that his policy is to never tell a lie. Later, he utters his <em>first and last</em> lie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in order to trick Prince Ling into letting him commit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Kimb</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">lee</a> wears many masks to conceal his psychopathy, but he never tells a direct untruth. For example, when he is talking to Winry, he tells her about finding her parents' bodies, and says that he admired their efforts and would have liked to meet them when they were alive. Sure, he was trying to make sure that she would trust him, but every word he said to her was genuinely true. After all, he never said he <em>wasn't</em> ordered to execute them.
</li></ul></li><li> Gilbert Durandal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, where he says he has a plan to bring ultimate peace and unity to the universe, ridding it of war. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His plan turns out to be forcing conformity on every human in the universe, so no one can disagree</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ohgi, for the record, implicitly trusting the word of the enemy commander and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prime Minister</span> who commissioned the weapon that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nuked Tokyo</span> and is aiming another at your flagship while he speaks to you and a woman who tried to kill you twice and makes no secret of her loyalty to the enemy is not the brightest move in the entire world. Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Schneizel wasn't entirely lying. The list of people Lelouch may or may not have controlled with his Geass is shockingly accurate, and the only evidence he has that he himself was not controlled is that he's not dead</span>. Of course, while most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">the stated facts are true</a>, the implied actions are not.
</li><li> Another example is Lelouch's promise to Rolo. At this point, Lelouch states that he won't lie <em>to him</em>. Which is false reassurance for two reasons: first, Lelouch may love Rolo so much that he won't lie to him...except that the fact that he loves Rolo at all may be a lie. Second, Lelouch always lies to people he loves. Rolo, how could he forbid himself to lie to his fake brother when he lied so much to Nunnally in R1? (yes, he states than he can't lie to Nunnally during the "new governor" phone call...but actually, in R1 he pretended that everything was fine at Euphemia's SAZ opening ceremony).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Hey, Sasuke, guess what? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi's actually a good guy</span>!
<ul><li> At least with that one he checks his facts when he could. Granted, this was about 75 chapters later and he'd been under the assumption Tobi was telling the truth for all that time.
</li><li> One of Tobi's claims is later proven false—<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was actually responsible for the Nine-Tailed Fox's attack</span>.
</li><li> One of the more outstanding examples was Tobi revealing his evil plan to the four Kages and their retainers. It involved <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">merging all known bijuus into another one, Ten-Tails, and using it to project his genjutsu to the moon and trapping the entire humanity with it. Everyone believes him without realizing that if this is actually what he intends to do, he sabotaged himself by revealing it</span>.
</li><li> Orochimaru actually inverts this trope. When he goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Tsunade</a> for help and she asks him about his arms, he openly admits to killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Sandaime Hokage</a>, even though it would hurt his chances of her helping him. He also openly admits he wants to destroy the Leaf Village, but appears to decide to spare it when Tsunade asks him to as a condition for healing his arms. However, when Tsunade's treachery becomes apparent to him, he admits he was lying.
</li><li> "Madara's" identity is a fourth wall-piercing example. Many readers never questioned his identity simply because he stated he's Madara and other characters believed him. That and the person he was eventually revealed to be was thought way too obvious to be be real.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Kara no Kyoukai</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Shirazumi says that Shiki is the killer, it's outed IMMEDIATELY as a lie. However, when Shirazumi says that Shiki's beloved is dead, which as far as the viewer knows is true, Shiki takes it on slim evidence. She did not see the body.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: During their fight in Karakura Town, Aizen waxes lyrical about how he has manipulated all of Ichigo's battles to develop his strength and power for Aizen's own gain. He even claims he has been manipulating Ichigo's life from the moment he was born. Ichigo notices that Aizen's words are contradicting what he said back on Sougyoku Hill, and accuses him of lying. Aizen points out that if he really is a liar, why would Ichigo trust anything he says to believe he was telling the truth back then and lying now; Ichigo should instead assume that Aizen has been lying constantly since the moment they met. When this sinks in for Ichigo, Aizen explains that he doesn't bother with lies or truth because truth is in the eye of the beholder: nothing Aizen says can ever be trusted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: Ubik always tells the truth. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the truth is always pretty damn depressing</a>. That's why he does so well with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">Hannibal Lecture</a>.
</li><li> This would be why Maka fell for Medusa's emotional blackmail in the Baba Yaga arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> when she hears that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">apparently</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">witch</a> is a mother who would do anything to protect her child. She wouldn't have even needed to explicitly mention Spirit, but does so simply to drive the point home. It works like a charm, and isn't the first or last time Maka's caught out by something of the sort.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, after All For One reveals to All Might that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shigaraki is the grandson of All Might's mentor Nana Shimura,</span> All Might falls into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and claims he's lying, until All For One replies by saying All Might knows its the truth, because it's something that he would clearly do.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyubey</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> rarely tells the whole truth, but never in the series actually says something that's later proven to be untrue. It's very good at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">twisting what it says</a> to get the desired result, though.

Also, they are bound only to the word of their agreements while being willing to break the spirit if it suits them; a faerie who promises it will "protect you from danger to your life" may break your back and both your legs and dump you in a hospital to keep you from being in <em>actual</em> danger of death.

</li><li> Post-season one, Danaerys repeatedly says that her dragons are the only children she will ever have and no one questions the accuracy of this statement until Jon asks who told her this in the season 7 finale. When Dany replies "the witch who killed my husband", he points out that a murderer is probably not the best source of information.
</li></ul></li><li> Legal and police dramas, with their emphasis on the veracity of witnesses, defendants, etc., frequently play with this trope. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> mocked it in the episode "Access Nation", in which a convicted felon, while in prison, uses an Internet information-gathering company to track someone down and then murders that person upon his release. The owner of the company, trying to defend himself from accusations of wrongdoing, points out that all customers are required to fill out a form asking if they had a criminal record. McCoy says, "And it never occurred to you that someone with a criminal record might actually <em>lie</em> about it?"
</li><li> Ben Linus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> is pretty much <em>always</em> lying, but the other characters pretty much <em>always</em> believe him, even if they say they know what he's up to.

Nobody believes him, and most assume that it's some kind of act. His cop partner Chloe tells him that, grandstanding devil act aside, she knows she can trust him.

On meeting the late Queen Igraine, Arthur learns the truth about the circumstances of his birth: that his father Uther made a deal with a sorceress to help them conceive, which resulted in Igraine's death thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancingDeathsBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancingDeathsBooks">the nature of the spell</a>. This enrages Arthur so much that he races home to Camelot and almost kills his father, only for Merlin to talk him out of it by suggesting to him that Morgause had made the whole thing up and that the spirit of Igraine wasn't real. The twist is that although Morgause <em>could</em> have conjured up a fake Igraine (the show is never clear), the audience knows (thanks to conversations betwen Uther/Gaius) that everything Igraine told Arthur about his birth <em>was</em> in fact completely true. Even more interestingly, <strong>Merlin</strong> knows the information was true but has to lie to Arthur to protect him.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>:
<ul><li> The serpent (who may or may not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>) tells Eve that eating of the forbidden fruit won't lead to her death like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> said it would, and she believes him, making this the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a>. It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth">Half-Truth</a>: It's true that the fruit gives humans the ability to decide for themselves what is good and evil (rather than relying on God), like the serpent says. Opinion is divided over whether God's warning was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth">Half-Truth</a> or not: eating it did not kill them immediately and God had to remove them from the garden so they could not eat from the one fruit that could apparently restore/maintain their immortality; however, God never said <em>when</em> or <em>how</em> they would die.
<ul><li> Subverted. Orthodox Christianity says that the death is a coincidence of disobedience of God's law. Adam and wife could live forever if they followed the Lord. And after they committed the first sin, and couldn't manage to repent, so they died - they become sinners, moreover they got passions - eight deadly illnesses, and all their deeds became sinful. The death was simply not instantaneous. So, it's the case of devil being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Consummate Liar</a>. That's why Jesus called him a killer of man: he convinced them to fall.
</li><li> Also subverted by Catholic Christianity. The serpent (who is indeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> according to the Church) tells Eve that eating the fruit will make her and Adam beings above God; the Original Sin as it's known is not in the act of eating the fruit (which would be considered an act of Gluttony) but to try to put themselves above God, which indeed becomes the root of the Deadly Sin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>, and by extension, of all sins that followed. In fact, this act is considered what introduced pain and death to mankind as Adam and Eve were expelled from the Paradise and prevented from eating the Fruit of Life, which would indeed have given them immortality.
</li></ul></li><li> The apocryphal Book of Jubilees has it as "if you eat the fruit you will die on the same day" and Adam and Eve both died 900-odd years later: "in the eyes of God a thousand years are as a day".
</li><li> There is also a case of a heroic use of this alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">From a Certain Point of View</a>: King David has Hushai spy on Absalom by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor">becoming his adviser</a>. He even says "<em>As I have served in thy father's presence</em>, so will I be in thy presence."
</li><li> Satan quotes Scripture during his temptation of Jesus. Jesus doesn't fall for it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteToQuoteCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteToQuoteCombat">responds with further quotes</a> which explain why Satan's interpretations are wrong.
<ul><li> In this case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> is not being deceptive by lying, but by distorting the original intent of each quote, which is why Jesus's rebuttals are quotes as well, to return them again to the context and meaning in which they were written.

<ul><li> This is a key element of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">deals with the devil</a>. In Goethe's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust">Faust</a></em>, Mephistopheles surprises the doctor by telling him that hell has laws and that, therefore, he can be trusted to hold up his end of the bargain. The quintessential feature of such a deal is that the devil figure either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">twists the terms of the agreement to subvert their intended effect</a> or brings about some change that renders the benefit he confers undesirable—not that he breaks the agreement outright. Without this trope—played straight, mind you—this effect couldn't be achieved.
</li><li> In Marlowe's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DoctorFaustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DoctorFaustus">Doctor Faustus</a></em>, Mephistopheles is even more honest. He tells Faust he'll give him certain powers and abilities in exchange for Faust's soul, and keeps the bargain to the letter, giving Faust everything he promised. Interestingly, he even tries to talk Faust out of it, pointing out that if he, Mephistopheles, a demon, exists, then wouldn't it stand to reason that God also exists, and that Faust, by implication, would be making a horrible mistake by taking Mephistopheles up on his offer? Faust replies that that doesn't follow at all, since just because one part of a story turns out to be true, it doesn't prove that the whole story is true. Mephistopheles concedes the point.

The fiends in question are being completely fair and honest, even going so far as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">point out that there is an alternative</a>—although this would require V to admit that he/she had failed. Although the soul splice doesn't actually turn Varsuvius evil, black cloak and glowing eyes notwithstanding, absolute power still corrupts...
<ul><li> It should be pointed out that Director Lee, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">devil</a>, is kind of required to give an alternative. See, infernal pacts in D&amp;D only work if the metaphorical Faust is given a choice. If the deal is made under duress, Vaarsuvius could challenge the deal in a diabolical court in the Nine Hells. Since diabolic courts are somewhat fair (they are beings of pure law and evil, after all), Vaarsuvius could wriggle his way out of the deal and possibly get the commission scrapped by whatever archdevil approved of it. The fiends, however, exploit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Vaarsuvius'</a> ego in order to ensure he would pick the option <em>they</em> wanted him to pick. And they told the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">exact</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">truth</a> the whole time.
</li></ul></li><li> Also played with in that same story arc. The fiends tell Vaarsuvius "You may be experiencing some slight feedback. You know, alignment-wise", and "Do not let them influence your actions! YOU are the one in control!" The last sentence of that is entirely true. The other three are half-true at best. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All together, though, it implies the reverse. Thus, Vaarsuvius assumes s/he isn't in control of hirself, and, as one of them later points out, "A good way to get a decent person to do something horrible is to convince them that they're not responsible for their actions." Horrible indeed...</span>
</li><li> Also subverted in an unexpected way: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While the alternative they presented could have worked as far as V knew, it was based on his/her incorrect assumption about the current location of the party's healer. Had V pursued that course, s/he would have accomplished nothing more than suicide. They presented it as part of full disclosure in order to legitimize the contract; V was making a free-willed choice without any lies on their part. As far as V knew, this other option would have worked and not required any obligation to the Fiends. In any case, they knew V would never accept the alternative plan as presented, because it would require admitting defeat and failure to use someone <em>else's</em> plan to get other people to save V's family</span>.
</li><li> It gets even better later. They said they'd get custody of V's soul for the same length of time as V used the power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> V (and probably most of the readers) <em>assumed</em> they'd do it at V's death, but they never actually specified a time. One of them chooses to do it when V desperately needs to get a message to the rest of the party. V had actually worked out that the price as s/he understood it didn't really make sense, since his/her actions during the effects had already earned an eternity of damnation on their own.</span>

For some reason, Zuko believes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Azula</a> when she offers him the chance to join her to take over Ba Sing Se. This is despite his trustworthy uncle berating him for this, and her having explicitly betrayed him in the first episode of the season. AND despite his childhood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalMantra">litany</a> to himself - "Azula always lies." Despite this, however, this is one of the few times where she's being fully honest. Probably more for her own convenience, but she shows no intention whatsoever of betraying him... until he inadvertently informs her that Aang is still alive, at which point she carefully sets him up to take the blame if that truth ever becomes public.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand">Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</a></em>. In a climactic fight with Evil Emperor Zurg (complete with glowing metal rods, just to drive the parody home to the viewers), Zurg tells Buzz that he is Buzz's father, causing Buzz to gasp out a "what" response. Zurg then continues the fight after he reveals that the previous reveal was a sham to catch Buzz off guard. <br/><br/>This is a recycled gag from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2">Toy Story 2</a></em>, only the end result is different.

Then again, they're supposed to be toys acting the part of their "namesake" characters. The cartoon series is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">Defictionalization</a> of the movies, so the toys might have taken the idea "from the cartoon" and ran with it.
