<ul><li> Subverted. Despite being born without any magic, Asta has trained diligently for years, giving him an incredibly muscular body and great strength. However, in the first chapter it's established that, despite his musculature, he still can't compare to skilled mages. Then, he manifests his grimoire, which gives him an anti-magic sword that he can wield because of his lack of magic <em>and</em> strength from years of training.
</li><li> This is discussed regarding the kingdom's aristocracy. It's stated that the biggest factor to learn spells is natural talent. Nobility rarely train as a result and look down on it as something people who are not born into power do. However, it's also stated that dedicated training, battle experience, and intense determination in a crisis are important factors in manifesting power. This explains how the Black Bulls, who are mostly commoners who have been through many tough battles and trained hard, effectively face off against other, mostly noble Magic Knights in the Royal Knights Exam. And it's because Noelle has natural talent and worked hard as a Black Bull that she learns her spell Valkyrie Armor to save her siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ichigo has gone through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> lots of times, but that hasn't stopped him from conquering a curriculum lasting approximately hundreds of years in the matter of weeks, days or <em>hours</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Which is why he had to lose that power in order to keep the story going, because if enemies are EVEN stronger than that state, then the rest of the cast would be even more superfluous than they already were.</span>
</li><li> It's stated by Aizen that Shinigami have a specific limit to how powerful they can get which is determined long before they even start trying to get stronger, and it's implied that this applies to Hollows as well. This trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">was even discussed</a> by Grimmjow's minions who, after eating thousands of Hollows to try to advance to the highest Hollow stage, noted that their growth had just completely stopped at some point. This was part of Aizen's motivation to create the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Hougyoku</a>, which can alter both Shinigami and Hollows to erase those predetermined limits, either by turning them into Shinigami/Hollow hybrids or, in his own case, by transcending both types of power.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChoujinSensen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChoujinSensen">Choujin Sensen</a></em>: According to FEE, this is how Tomobiki justifies his action in not enrolling in college, finding a full-time job, or confessing to the girl he likes.
</li><li> Yamcha from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series has an extreme case of this, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Even in the original series, he was often used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> despite training a lot, particularly for Martial Arts tournaments. For the third tournament at the end of <em>Dragon Ball</em>, he even does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> in alone the wild for three years, invents a new move from scratch, and still loses in his first match. In <em>Z</em>, Yamcha never wins a single fight, ultimately realizes he'll never be useful in protecting the Earth, and gives up after almost dying a third time in the Android Saga. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, he had still never achieved any of his goals in life (getting married and/or winning a World Martial Arts Tournament).
<ul><li> Vegeta, he trains and trains and trains, but Goku is most of time stronger than him, and the only saving grace for him is that thanks to his AND Goku's constant training, they're both the strongest characters in the entire series. Yes, Goku trains (though it's usually unclear just how much, or whether it's because he just gets better training), too, but at nowhere near the level of Vegeta. The funny thing is that Vegeta was supposed to be the super-talented prodigy. Whis suggests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F'</a></em> that Vegeta actually trains <em>too</em> hard and doesn't let himself relax, which hurts him and doesn't allow him to build his strength up to Goku's level (on the other hand, Goku's relaxation means he lets his guard down when Vegeta wouldn't).
</li><li> Averted with Goku and Gohan. Gohan has far greater inherent potential, but does not find fighting fun, so he prefers having a normal life to constant practice. Goku, on the other hand, spends most of his life (and whatever parts of his afterlife we saw) undergoing ever more extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> and eventually outpaces Gohan. Gohan in his mystic form ends up becoming the most powerful unfused character in the entire series due to his potential, only outpaced by Goku and Vegeta, who kept up their training while Gohan finally knuckled down and concentrated on studying.
</li><li> There's also the fact that Goku trained under several masters of martial arts throughout his life, learning various techniques and training methods that compensated for his low (for a Saiyan) inherent power, while Vegeta, for most of his life, was too arrogant to even <em>think</em> of asking someone to train him. When Vegeta finally swallows his pride in <em>Super</em> and asks Whis to train him, he rapidly catches up to Goku. But then Goku asks Whis to train <em>him</em>, and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">well...</a>
</li><li> It's played completely straight when you compare Saiyans with non-Saiyan characters: Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu eventually more or less pretty much spent <em>all their time</em> training after a certain point, and remained hopelessly behind the Saiyan characters nonetheless. Neither of them could even put a <em>scratch</em> on Nappa! Even though Tenshinhan was able to harm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Semi-Perfect Cell,</a> managed to survive Super Buu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Human Extinction Attack,</a> and later showed up against Buu...the pink git practically only needed to <em>cough</em> to send Tien flying (though that's more thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a>).
</li><li> There's also the fact that Saiyans get a literal, quantifiable power boost from <em>almost dying.</em> At one point on Namek, Vegeta's strategy is "have Krillin shoot a hole through my chest, and then get Dende to heal me". It's the only time anyone invokes it, implying that it's less efficient than training (and it does nothing to raise any sort of skill, just power level), but the fact is that their biology is built for this trope. Yamcha, Krillin, and Tien may gain skill by fighting to the death, but they'll never get the same gains that Goku and Vegeta get in that same situation.
</li><li> Really, anyone who isn't Goku (and to a lesser extent, Gohan) falls victim to this trope. Piccolo, despite having no family or friends to distract from his constant training (the only person he spends any time with is Gohan, and essentially all the time they spend together <em>is</em> training), and at one point being STRONGER than the Saiyans during the Android Saga, is nowhere near as strong any time afterwards. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F',</a></em> Vegeta has managed to restore himself to relevance, but the non-Saiyans are still little better than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, no matter how hard they train.
</li><li> This is lampshaded by Master Roshi with the quote at the top of the page, as back in the original series we had no idea what a Saiyan was.
</li><li> Master Roshi gets to lampshade it a second time during the Android Saga when he admits he was once called the 'Strongest in the World' but now he'd 'give anything just to be able to help out again'. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He does a pretty good job in the Universe Survival Saga, where he manages to get three eliminations on his own before succumbing to exhaustion.</span>
</li><li> Vegeta may not <em>quite</em> be able to keep up with Goku at Super Saiyan 3 (they were more or less equal at Super Saiyan 2), but he comes a damn sight closer than anyone else in the universe. There's a <em>reason</em> Frieza was scared of how powerful the Saiyans might become.
</li><li> Then there is the case of Goten and Trunks, who are the youngest of Super Saiyans. Gohan, Vegeta, Chi-Chi and Goku each had their own expressions of shock when they found this out. The three older Saiyans had to go through sweat and blood to accomplish their transformations, and the two brats just got theirs when they were playing in the woods.
<ul><li> This seems to have become a trend for human-Saiyan hybrids, as the end of Dragon Ball GT shows one of Goku's descendants (his great-great grandkid) casually using the Super Saiyan transformation in a tournament sparring match along with one of Vegeta's descendants.
</li><li> The Super Saiyan transformation comes in response to a need, not a desire. In all known cases, the form has been initially triggered by either desperation or indignation. However, Saiyans are somewhat detached (with the exception of Goku), which is why it is difficult. For hybrids such as Gohan, they possess the emotional connection of humans allowing them to reach it easier. Kid Trunks, Goten and Goku Jr., being young children, have the easiest time being forced into desperation or indignation.
</li><li> Goku Jr., Goku's great-great grandson becomes a Super Saiyan defending a bear against a pig-demon thing, a clearer example compared to Trunks and Goten.
</li></ul></li><li> The best way to describe this trope in Dragon Ball is that while hard work pales before natural talent, said talent must be <em>maintained</em> with hard work. Saiyan hybrids like Gohan, Goten and Trunks have more potential than their full-blooded Saiyan fathers, but said fathers are also constantly training to improve themselves while Gohan is more focused on studying and Goten and Trunks on being kids. Dragon Ball's infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a> is also a factor. While anime filler shows that by the end of the Namek saga, the Z fighters (yes, including Yamcha) are powerful enough to defeat the Ginyu Force (thanks to King Kai training them), who in their introduction were powerful enough to easily defeat Vegeta, the threats from the next saga put even <em>Frieza</em> to shame, so they're stuck being useless.
<ul><li> This is also demonstrated by Future Trunks, who's the last living fighter in his timeline and thus doesn't have the leisure to slack off like the others. When he returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, he's dealt with Majin Buu (well, Babidi and Dabura - he didn't let them come <em>close</em> to reviving Buu) and has spent a year fighting off an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> of Goku. As a result, he's achieved Super Saiyan 2 and is (at least according to the manga adaptation) equal to Super Saiyan 3 Goku in terms of power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And that's <em>before</em> he achieves a form that's seemingly just a step shy of Super Saiyan Blue.</span>
</li><li> Defied with Hit, who notes that as he has no transformations or inherent boosts to make himself more powerful, he has to get better the old-fashioned way. And it works. He manages to defeat Goku in their sparring match (if partially because Goku used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> that was about to run out and disable him), and by the next time Goku sees him, he's improved by leaps and bounds and is able to (temporarily) kill Goku.
</li><li> Completely and utterly averted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jiren:</span> hard work and training made him more powerful than <em>gods</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope explicitly comes into play in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F'</a></em>: after Frieza is wished back to life by his minions, he says that he thought being a prodigy was all he needed, only to receive a rude awakening thanks to Goku and Future Trunks. Thus, he resolves to train for the first time in his life so he can return to Earth and take his revenge on the Saiyans. His training succeeds, as he becomes powerful enough to challenge post-series Goku. The real kicker? It only takes him <em>four months</em> to come close to Goku's level, who had been training for <em>years</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, this trope isn't played completely straight. Frieza increased his raw strength, but didn't learn to control or maintain his power. Once he reached his super form, he could only keep it for a short time before his energy rapidly drained. Goku calls Frieza out on this, saying that instead of completing his training, he rushed to Earth as soon as he achieved his new transformation. It's re-averted when Frieza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovedAchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovedAchillesHeel">meditates while in Hell to learn to control his ki,</a> and by the time of the Universe Survival Saga, he's able to keep up without exhausting himself.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is why Liz Ricarro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IGPXImmortalGrandPrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IGPXImmortalGrandPrix">IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix</a></em> gets angry with Takeshi. She trains herself so much whereas he rarely does anything and yet, they're just as good at being mech pilots. It can easily seen where Liz first beats him handily in kung fu, what she has been practicing for years, in the first episode. That is until Takeshi practices kendo, where he easily beats her in the second season.
<ul><li> Then partly defied in the same season when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Takeshi talks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> Max about everyone working together.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, Unsui and Agon, twin brothers, couldn't be further apart in ability. Unsui puts himself through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> (at one point shown doing one handed push-ups with their team's center sitting on his back) and is only "a great player". Agon doesn't practice at all, and is "a once-in-a-century prodigy." He's also the only one of the Shinryuuji Nagas who has any luck with the ladies (being that they go to an all-boys school). Sure, he's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a>, but he's also stone-cold <em>evil</em>. Ever since his team's loss to Deimon, he <em>has</em> been working out with increasing fervor and desperation; He doesn't want to become the trash he sees everyone else as. Subverted twice, though, when Hiruma deliberately (and successfully) sets Yukimitsu (who is 0 percent talent and 100 percent hard work) against him, and when Hiruma himself (a physically average player) outruns Agon because he improved his 40-yard dash by 0.1 seconds through the training Agon disdains.
<ul><li> Leonard Apollo learned this the hard way during his time in the NFL, as well.
</li><li> And then there's the Yuuhi Guts. Even the <em>manager</em> keeps a training regiment so brutal it would bring most other schools' <em>players</em> to tears, but they only score one touchdown against Deimon in the fall tournament.
<ul><li> It's worth nothing that the actual players (i.e. the ones that trained hard and ended up scoring the only touchdown) were only in the game for the last few minutes. The school had opted to use star players from other sports (Yuuhi being a renowned sports school where football was the only thing they didn't excel at), and they played terribly, having never practiced football itself and generally having no teamwork whatsoever. Had the actual football players been in the entire time, well, they probably still would've lost (Deimon was still the better team and trained every bit as hard as the Guts, after all), but it would've been a much closer game.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of the characters avert this too, though. And almost all of the "I'm just that good!" types wind up getting owned by Deimon, who are the results of canny planning, hell-training, and tenacity. Pretty much everyone on the Deimon team worked hard for their abilities in some way or another, and the closest it has to a "he's just that good" is the quarterback's planning skill.
</li><li> One of the only moments in the series that makes Agon seem like less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> is due to this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Habashira Rui has to sub in for Shin when he's injured in the final game against America. <em>Everyone,</em> Habashira included, knows that he's not good enough to take on America. But he does it anyway, and Agon removes his wig and glasses, taking the game 100% seriously for perhaps the first time, purely out of respect for Habashira and to remind Unsui what he should be striving for.</span>
<ul><li> Shin averts this trope, however. Hiruma explicitly defines him as "the opposite of Agon, a monster who achieved his strength through hard work."
</li></ul></li><li> Another subversion is Monta vs the "genius" catchers such as Ikkyu and Taka. The fact that he spent years chasing after and catching baseballs allows him to follow the ball more closely than anyone else, a skill that allows him to beat his much more naturally-talented rivals.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. Edward gets to be a State Alchemist (a coveted position in Amestris) because of his natural talent moreso than how much work he puts into it.
<ul><li> Dante, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, delivers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">well deserved sledgehammer</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">Equivalent Exchange</a> and mentions this trope during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Dante</strong>: "Consider the state alchemy exam that you passed with flying colors. How many others took the test that day? Spent months, years preparing, some working much harder than you. Yet you were the only one who passed. Where was their reward? Is it their fault they lacked your natural talent?"
</div></li><li> Averted in the boxing anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, as hard work usually <em>does</em> pay off. The Main character Ippo does have immense punching power by nature, his friend/rival Miyata is called a genius for his talent, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a> Takamura is easily the best boxer in the whole series... but <em>all</em> of them still train very hard to get better and so do most other boxers. Kamogawa once said to Takamura "Not everyone who works hard is rewarded. However, all those who succeed have worked hard!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em> plays around with his trope in many ways but the most prominent is the aversion with Kenichi himself. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> but he doesn't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a>. Hard work always trumps untrained talent and between two hard workers, the one who works harder has the advantage. The entire story is a message in that you need to work hard to keep up in the world of martial arts.
<ul><li> Kenichi is repeatedly said to be completely average and talentless, and his only strength is training hard. Although the people he beats up on a regular basis also probably train hard as well and probably have been doing so for more than a few months, they still don't train <em>as</em> hard as Kenichi. He trains under numerous different masters, working 7 days a week and often dying from the training, only to be brought back with medicine and first-aid. So while Kenichi might not have trained as long as his opponents, he has trained hundreds of times harder. That's why he defeat Karate club bullies and Ragnarok thugs. <em>Yomi</em> is a different matter. His opponents there are all expert martial artists, raised by masters every bit as strong as his own, with techniques just as brutal, which means he loses some of his "hard work" advantage.
</li><li> When Takeda begins his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> under the underground boxing master, his abilities surge massively in a very short amount of time, putting him very nearly in Kenichi/Yomi tier within a much shorter time than Kenichi himself needed. He even began to unravel and utilize Kenichi's recently-learned perfect defense within a single sparring match. So apparently when a person who is already exceptionally talented (as Kenichi's masters have all noticed) starts that sort of training, the results are dramatic and much faster. So it's subverted in that for the prodigies, hard work <em>really</em> works.
</li><li> It's zigzagged with Berserker, a boy who has never had any training, but is so naturally talented that he has never lost a single fight. Then Tanimoto manages to defeat him, and afterward states that this entire trope is a lie:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"One part talent may equal a hundred parts of hard work, but what if it's one thousand parts hard work? What about <em>ten</em> thousand? In the world of martial arts, hard work will <em>always</em> trump natural talent."
</div><ul><li> Natsu, who like Takeda is very naturally talented even manages to quickly boost his skill level by consistently fighting opponents who are just a little bit better than he is. Part of his resumed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> by his own master who is the brother of one of Kenichi's masters.
</li><li> Everyone in Yomi works hard but here are prodigies among Yomi's ranks and Kenichi's masters point out that being a prodigy doesn't mean anything without training yourself to back it up and that they can't simply rely on their innate talents.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> is an extreme version. The title character literally did not train <em>at all</em>, instead skipping right to fighting monsters for an hour or two after school each day. Within a week she's stronger than someone else around her age who had been training <em>his entire life</em>, and by the end of the first season (at most a couple months) she's become A (elite) rank. When there are more seasons, much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">Rank Inflation</a> ensues though there's at least a considerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between the second and third seasons.
<ul><li> The second season and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplementary manga</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explains</a> all this by... turning Nanoha into a complete aversion of this. Her exponential increase in strength? It's revealed that thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand">Raising Heart</a>, she's able to train <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">every single waking moment of her life</a></em>, displaying astonishing multi-tasking skills by running virtual reality training programs directly into her mind while she eats, goes to school, and does her other activities. This is in addition to her waking up early and going to bed late to practice her magic in the real world, and Raising Heart going on Pressure Mode to act like a magical training weight that forces Nanoha's magical growth by draining her mana when she's not active.
<ul><li> The third season then subverts it; apparently all that built up stress and exhaustion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">caught up to her years later</a>, nearly killing her on a routine mission.
</li></ul></li><li> Additionally, said manga shows that while Chrono (said "someone else her age") isn't as powerful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">his combat experience actually allows him to be able to defeat both Nanoha and Fate</a>.
</li><li> Teana is a complete aversion. Unlike the other Forwards, she doesn't have the advantage of winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a></span>, but she manages to become the only one of them to reach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">S Rank</a> (half a rank below Nanoha) through hard work alone.
</li><li> This is Jill Stola's personal philosophy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike">ViVid Strike!</a></em>, and is one of the things that Nove disagrees with her on. The irony being that Jill earned her skill while Nove is a genetically enhanced combat cyborg. Then again, Nove is close friends with - and was originally defeated by - Teana, so she knows first hand that this trope doesn't always apply.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji">Muhyo and Roji</a></em>, during Muhyo's days at the academy, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enchu</span> works hard to become an Executor while Yoichi and Muhyo slack off. However, Muhyo soon realizes his talent, and despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enchu</span> pulling all-nighters when he and Muhyo are considered for Executor, Muhyo is chosen.
<ul><li> It's later revealed that there was more to the decision than aptitude; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Page said the committee was concerned by Enchu's preoccupation with his ill mother (her death greatly contributed to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, and was <em>part of Teeki's plan</em>), and chose Muhyo because he, in refusing the position, was thinking of others</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted/Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mx0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mx0">Mx0</a></em>. Kuzumi is thought to be an incredibly gifted wizard with a gold card. In reality he has no magic, and his innate skill is so low that he failed the entrance exam. Everything he does he does through careful lying and a lot of hard work. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The series ends (aggravatingly abruptly, due to cancellation) with him temporarily transferring to another school with a special tutor who is going to push him up to gold card level through raw hard work.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a>:</em> The series had the initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> that hard work would trump natural talent any time. As the series progressed however, that... wasn't always perfectly represented.
<ul><li> Rock Lee seems like the poster child for this trope.
<ul><li> He has little natural talent whatsoever and trains and trains and trains to prove he can be a powerful ninja without ninjustu or genjustsu. He has a good showing at first, easily defeating the two leads, but then proceeds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">to lose almost every other fight he gets into</a>. However, those losses tend to come from extremely powerful enemies and Lee has impressive showings for those fights. His fight with Gaara, for example, had Gaara's teammates spend the entire match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">panicking</a> at how badly Lee was manhandling him. Also, it is indisputable that Lee has come a long way from where he was in the academy, where even his beloved and supportive Guy sensei admitted he was pathetic. So, hard work may not have made him the best around, but without it he'd be useless.
</li><li> It should be noted that Lee is hardly talentless. Sure, his talent with the more traditional ninja arts is non-existent. However, it is also said by Kakashi there is no way hard work alone can get you to open five gates at age 13. Lee's case is really a person whose talent is not discovered by lesser teachers and he later runs into a teacher that recognizes his real talent and applied the appropriate training method for that talent. Naruto (and possibly his earlier reincarnations) is more or less the same thing. Basically, hard work is important, but to get to the very top or close to it, you need BOTH talent and hard work.
</li></ul></li><li> Sasuke was born with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a>, specifically one that lets him instantly copy any technique and, with sufficient training and aptitude, execute it flawlessly, in addition to already exceptional skills. Now, quite a few times he is said to train seriously, notably in his Fire Release jutsus and Chuunin exam training, but much of it happens offscreen, and he has gotten several powerups in a row thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a> mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate">The Power of Hate</a>. He does receive his Mangekyo after a grueling battle with Itachi, and it requires battles with several powerful opponents for him to master it. However, this trope becomes more notable after he receives Itachi's eyes from Tobi, whereupon he starts receiving incredible power-ups without any work put in. Much like Naruto, he tends to ping-pong as the plot demands. As best as we know, the two characters on the opposite ends of the scale are Indra and Ashura, the sons of the Sage of the Six Paths who both achieved similar levels of power, Indra through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a>, and Ashura through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>.
</li><li> The titular character ping-pongs between both ends. On the one hand, he starts the series as a talentless loser whose only saving grace is insane amounts of stamina. On the other hand, we learn that his parents were both highly-skilled ninja and the Kyuubi implanted in him makes incredibly strong, and is the reason for his incredible stamina in the first place. However, learning to control the Kyuubi's chakra was a long, dangerous process and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Sage of Six Paths</span> has pointed out that incredible parents don't always pass down their talent. However, in earlier chapters Tsunade said that Naruto's ninjutsu style is like his mother's (we never really saw Kushina fight) and its been noted a few times that he also inherited her strong chakra genes to make it even possible for him to control the Kyuubi chakra.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hje6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hje6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hje6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though he didn't inherit his mother's powerful "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainPain">chakra chains</a>" ability; instead his distant cousin Karin spontaneously manifests that ability.</span> Naruto will frequently undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> which would seem like an aversion, but he often gains extraordinary power from it that no one else could or would get and in some cases he uses his aforementioned incredible stamina to take shortcuts that wouldn't be available to use for other people. Finally, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> who is destined to succeed through hard work, as paradoxical as that sounds. At the end, he and Sasuke only succeed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> in the form of the Sage Of Six Paths inexplicably showing up and giving both of them a power up due to them being the reincarnations of his sons.</span>
</li><li> It's also worth mentioning Shikamaru. For most of the series, he is the definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>. During the Chunin Exams, he is the only participant to pass and be promoted to Chunin even though he was by far the laziest participant and passed entirely due to impressing the proctors with his raw natural ability. In spite of his slacker tendencies, he ends up being the one of the youngest jonin of his generation. He also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becomes co-general of his own division during the war</span>. It could be said that he only grows strong after he starts working hard. But considering the effort he puts in compared to everyone else, it's obvious that his success is mostly due to his genius intellect.
</li><li> And then we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Might Guy</a> to provide the ultimate subversion: as a child, he was so talentless he <em>failed the academy entrance exam</em> the first time around and couldn't use ninjutsu and genjutsu, but by the time we met him his training had enabled him to use ninjutsu and made him one of Konoha's top shinobi. And when he uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">the Eight Gates</a>, he becomes capable of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> warping space <em>with a kick</em></span>. Hard Work is partly what made Guy strong enough to knock around <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Uchiha Madara, the guy who Curbstomped all five living Kage at the same time</span> like a <em>ragdoll.</em> Other factors were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Madara</span> holding back against Guy. Along with Minato, Gaara, Kakashi, and Lee helped nerf him. Still, it's enough for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Madara</span> to declare him the greatest Taijutsu master he has ever faced, and give him more respect than the entire Shinobi Alliance. In fact, Guy is one of only two people <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madara</span> <em>ever</em> considered a worthy opponent.
</li><li> Also zig-zagged with Naruto's son, Boruto, who is talented at chakra control. However, his laziness causes him to fall behind other Genin of his generation and causes him to resort to cheating with preloaded jutsus. In the final battle, the one jutsu he worked hard on, the Vanishing Rasengan, managed to save the heroes from the villain (who is also lazy). Of course, Naruto's massive chakra was still necessary to finish the villain off.
</li></ul></li><li> Ren of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> suffers from this. His entire life has basically been one long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, and yet no matter how hard he pushes himself, Yoh always kicks his butt with what seems to be little to no effort, the whole while spouting off his own philosophy of not pushing himself too hard to do something he can't do (which would have been the thing required to defeat Ren in that particular battle) until for no apparent reason he is suddenly granted the ability to do that critical thing (or more commonly, the strategy that every experienced Shaman watching thought was total suicide turns out to work).
<ul><li> It's worth remembering that prior to the story's beginning Yoh was given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> by his grandfather and later his fiance, but said training didn't give him any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">hidden power for him to conceal</a> or help him get over his slacker tendencies. Hell, he's practically the <em>messiah</em> of slackers!

<ul><li> Judai, despite sleeping through all the few classes he bothers to attend, effortlessly beats anybody who challenges him (except for Ryo that one time). Deconstructed in season 3 when an Isaac Newton-like teacher tried to take revenge on him for inspiring pupils to ignore studying and try to emulate his success and a villain convinced him that everything coming so easily for him meant he wasn't a true hero. It was almost like a summary of how nobody likes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> because nowadays, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">True Art Is Angsty</a>.
</li><li> The <em>one</em> time he <em>did</em> prepare and use a coherent strategy, in the second duel with Ryo, it didn't work. Ryo commented that it was a disappointment and told him to go back to dueling the way he did before. (He took this advice to heart and managed to end it in a draw.)
</li><li> The best example in the series however comes from Daichi Misawa, the Ra Yellow who was originally set up in Season 1 as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> to Judai. While exceptionally smart, he is shown spending hours upon hours studying and formulating strategies in order to beat his foes, being so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> as to make <em>8 different decks</em> over the course of the series (6 elemental decks, a seventh specifically to beat Judai, and an 8th "perfect" deck he used for the rest of the series.) With the exception of Manjoume in Season 1, however, he rarely ever won duels on-screen, and the few times he did win were against nameless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirts">Red Shirts</a>, and no one else cared. Be it Judai <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">revealing an all new card perfect for the scenario</a>, or the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">manipulating his will,</a> Misawa's hard work all came to naught against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPokerEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPokerEquation">Magic Poker Equation</a>, and ended with him running away from the school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">buck naked.</a>

Yusuke trains too, sure. But always manages to find shortcuts, leaving everyone else to get there the hard way.
<ul><li> Come to that, throughout the series, Yusuke and Kuwabara mostly don't train during peaceful times. Kurama and Hiei do, and it lets them stay at roughly the same level. Hiei gets it the worst, because he doesn't seem to do anything else with his free time, while Kurama puts in enough work to stay at the top of his class in school and spends time with his human mother.
</li></ul></li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids">Zoids</a></em> protagonist of note tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">drop into the cockpit</a> without much previous combat experience, and manage to kick the backsides of more than a few expert enemies who've fought for years.
<ul><li> Bit Cloud might be a deconstruction, as he spent most of his adult life as a junk merchant specializing in Zoid parts and studying tactics, and isn't treated very seriously by opponents early on because he had little fame behind him. Bit also states at the start of the series he had wanted to be a pilot so it's possible he had trained beforehand. He's certainly good at coming up with a plan.
</li><li> Van and Bit are both justified by having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientSteed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientSteed">Organoid helping out from the inside</a>. Van in particular starts out relying almost entirely on Zeke, and receives proper training later on. Bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">might be smarter than he looks</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Negi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> manages to pick up martial arts pretty much over a weekend. He also manages to master incredibly advanced magical techniques in very little time. It's partially justified in that he uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">Year Inside, Hour Outside</a> mechanism to cram whole extra months of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> in. Even so, in the space of a month or so, he puts together a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> technique, the complexity of which surprises the person who created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> to begin with. Said person is an immortal vampire who previously spent years on it.
<ul><li> Jack Rakan might be an aversion. Unlike Negi, who was very powerful but didn't seem to put any effort into gaining that power, Jack Rakan spent almost whole his life fighting, he almost died many times but as time passed he became more and more powerful all thanks to decades of hard work. Even Negi refers to Rakan as "The Ultimate Hard-worker".
</li><li> In a possible subversion, Rakan is generally still acknowledged to be a lot stronger. The general opinion of the matter is that Negi's greatest strength lies in how proficient he is in making new techniques. At one point it's mentioned that people would just love to stick him behind a desk somewhere and make new spells.
</li><li> And for a completely played dead straight example, Nagi at the age of fifteen fought evenly with Rakan (forty years of combat experience) and presumably won their fight by a tiny margin. And Nagi is a lot less intelligent than Negi is and probably didn't do nearly the same type of training.
</li><li> The aversion is underlined by Fate Averruncus when Negi manages to defeat him after learning Dark Magic- Fate is surprised by that Negi could ever beat him in a fight, and is unable to improve himself because he never needed to train in his whole life. He only survives his fight against Rakan by using an artifact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">breaks the game</a> even more than Rakan himself, because it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">MAKES the game</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> possesses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a> that, sometimes, allows him this particular luxury. Although he has to train long and hard to attain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs">blinding speed</a> (the <em>Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken</em> and <em>Parlay du Fois Gras</em> training methods,) or learn a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">devastating technique</a> (the <em>Hiryuu Shouten Ha</em> and <em>Mouko Takabisha</em>,) "long and hard" for him means "a few days of experimentation," regardless of the decades it might have taken the techniques' original creators. Particularly noticeable in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Umisenken</a>, which he learned from watching it once, and practiced and <em>mastered</em> literally overnight, then used it to defeat the opponent who had trained in the opposite style Yamasenken his entire life.
<ul><li> It does help that the "Musabetsu Kakutō Saotome Ryū" (The Saotome School Of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatism</a>) is actually absurdly simple - accent on <em>absurd</em>. Its sole method of training is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">By Experience</a>. As in, survive stupid suicidal acts <strong>repeatedly</strong>. For example, Genma taught him how to fall from buildings without killing himself by throwing him off cliffs.

If there's something he doesn't know how to do with his body already, he can come up with a suicidal training aid and fill the gap in a day or so.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> when Natsu faces the Vanish Brothers. They say that the time spent training his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire magic</a> should make him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> and they should surpassed him in speed and strength from all their years of physical training. Nope! Not only does he have magic that they don't, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuWizard">his brand of magic requires him to train his physical body as well</a>, and since he's been using it since childhood, he's both stronger and faster than them despite being younger too.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em>, While Yuno is known to be hardworking, her skills will probably never be as good as those of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius">Ditzy Genius</a> neighbour Miyako.
</li><li> Likewise, Kisaragi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass">GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class</a></em> is also hardworking and doesn't seem to be very skilled, unlike the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a>-ish Nodamiki. Unlike <em>Hidamari Sketch</em>, though, whether she's that bad compared to Nodamiki has not been demonstrated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. Asuka is sent over the edge when Shinji's sync ratio got higher than hers even when she trained as a pilot for years. Then we found out why: it's revealed that Asuka figuratively "walling off" her heart from everyone (to avoid being hurt again) also caused her to shut out Eva-02 in all her attempts to synchronize with it<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">s resident soul, which just so happens to be that of her dead mother</span>, thus she was essentially piloting an Eva all wrong. The fact that she managed the highest sync ratio for any period of time is impressive, and Asuka is still a better pilot than Shinji in terms of self-discipline and practical skill anyway. The main problem being that the series is <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, where everything will always go wrong (unless you're in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> spin-off).
</li><li> Ironically, this utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defied</a> in Hideaki Anno's first work, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster">GunBuster</a></em>. The main character Noriko is of the belief that talent is all you need to be good at mecha piloting. However, her teacher shows her that the woman she looked up to works <strong>very</strong> hard to get were she is. In fact, one of the series' mottos is "Hard work and guts!"
</li><li> Averted and then played straight in the case of Kirino in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em>. She has been able to be a highly successful student athlete by practicing <em>really</em> hard, despite the lack of talent. However, after she starts being trained as a <em>professional</em> athlete, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it all falls apart as she clearly couldn't catch up to those who <em>also</em> have real talent.</span>
</li><li> Played with in the manga <em>Aisaretaino</em>: Izaki bears a lingering grudge against Hakamada because Hakamada excels at everything he turns his hand to without even trying, while Izaki himself works hard for little apparent return. Eventually, however, he discovers that Hakamada feels inferior to <em>him</em> because his accomplishments, obtained without real effort, feel empty, and he admires Izaki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">stubborn drive to succeed</a>. (On the other hand, Hakamada is a wealthy author who wrote a bestselling novel in three days, while Izaki is a salaryman, so we can't really call it a subversion of the trope.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Holyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Holyland">Holyland</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">which reads more or less like the author's love letter to martial arts and street fighting</a>, presents most fighters' skill as a mixture of training, fighting experience and inborn 'talent', and makes it clear that ultimately it's those with talent who rise to the top if they get the other two; training and experience can only compensate so much. Protagonist Yuu Kamishiro is noted to have talent and combines it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">working himself to the bone</a> and hard-earned experience to win over people who have martial arts backgrounds, despite lacking formal training and experience until his mid-teens (which would be a death sentence to most people's ability to compete). Some people, like Masaki, are noted to have all three, and serve as mentors or major street bumps during the story.
</li><li> Medaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> is about the epitome of this trope. Her abilities just literally come to her be it semi-naturally or through her ability <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a>, which not only allows her to acquire other peoples' powers just fighting or coming into contact with them (and later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just by hearing some details about the ability</span>) but allows her to master their ability even if the original holder hasn't done so themselves and create derivatives of them to suit her own needs <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">albeit ones that didn't take the original purpose of the ability into account</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This later comes to a head as she is considered an opponent that even an introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue">God-Mode Sue</a> can't beat.</span> Before the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> it wasn't really touched upon, but since becoming a battle manga, she's become somewhat of a Deconstruction of overpowered main characters. She does however state in the beginning that those with talent (like herself) do work to get where they are, but the work put in varies like any other person.
<ul><li> It's also played with in regards to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a> Zenkichi. Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamNormal">Team Normal</a> of the cast, he's able to keep up with other Superpowered characters through hard work and determination. Yet in a later arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> other characters explicitly stated to be normal easily upstage him in a Treasure Hunt.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> is a complete aversion, which is notable because it takes place in an MMO, which would naturally fall into this. The only way to increase your skills is to work, <em>hard</em>. If they weren't trapped inside the game 24/7, no one would have time to get past level ten. Even though everyone desperately wants to escape from the game, they grudgingly admit that it is fair. A very in-depth review of the series pointed out that this is largely because the series was written in 2000, before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, when MMOs were still grindfests where you could expect to do nothing but kill monsters to advance for most levels.
<ul><li> And then it's played straight in both the <em>Fairy Dance</em> (where he is explicitly cheating by carrying over his SAO stats) and <em>Phantom Bullet</em> arcs (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where Kirito basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomps</a> his human enemies</span>), only to be averted again during <em>Alicization</em>.

<ul><li> Sorata tells Nanami in Episode 15 that he hopes she succeeds at her audition because he's been watching her study hard ever since they were first year high school students, and hopes that it pays off at some point. Especially since both of them failed at their resepctive auditions the first time around.
</li><li> Played straight in the end of episode 20 and the whole episode 21: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it starts with Nanami failing her audition; goes on with Sorata's game failing the last review due to another rhythm game which was more simple, traditional and more appealing to the market; afterwards, all of the main cast fail at getting enough signatures to prevent the destruction of Sakura Hall; finally, to add insult to injury, the game company that rejected Sorata ended up sending a work offer to Shiina as character designer thanks to the pictures she gave to Sorata.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>. While natural talent grant you significant edge over untalented individuals, one still must train extremely hard to get results. Chief of the Hunter Association Netero stated that human potential is <em>limitless</em> and we know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">nen</a> can prevent aging. So, theoretically, a talentless person will require much more time to catch up, but eventually <em>will</em> catch up.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And gloriously subverted with Netero himself, who managed to fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mer</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">yem</a> on semi-equal ground due to insanely over the top training (even by Shonen standards).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight on the 3rd episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> during Season 3. An Idol Singer is loved and worshiped for her beauty and natural singing talent. However, during her youth, the Idol Singer used to bully another inspiring singer who was working very hard. The flashback also showed that the Idol Singer didn't even practice and got by on her looks, taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> pictures. The bullied girl tries to blackmail her by exposing the fan service photos; she demands the Idol Singer give her a break in the music business. But the Idol Singer tells her that she never could sing well. A scene earlier proves this when she sung and sounded off key. The once bullied girl cries about how she worked very hard all her life. But the Idol Singer responds by saying: "Hard work is the last resort of those without talent." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This makes the bullied girl call Hell Girl. And even though the Idol Singer paid her 3 million yen and wrote an apology song for the bullying, the bullied girl still sends her to hell, while the Idol Singer was singing the apology song live on stage during a concert. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty">revenge is empty however</a>, as the Idol Singer went on to become a music legend, while the bullied girl is forever broken, being in her shadow</span>.
</li><li> Averting this is a key part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>. Anyone can become a powerful esper if they work hard and focus on the ability improvement curriculum. Mikoto Misaka, one of the heroines, started out as a level 1 and rose to level 5 (the highest level) through patience and determination, and is often held up in the series as an example of what you can do if you work at it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except that's all a lie. Using the supercomputer Tree Diagram, the city's leadership knows who will respond best to the ability improvement.

Kaori manages to come out on top in her match with her uncanny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeginnersLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeginnersLuck">Beginner's Luck</a>, which disrupts the playstyle of Mako, her opponent from the protagonists' team, who plays with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">Photographic Memory</a> of her time in her grandfather's mahjong parlor and cannot counter Kaori's playstyle due to never having seen an amateur at play before. When the Tsuruga girls prepare to go to the individuals, Kaori is forbidden from practicing, under the reasoning that if she lost her beginner's luck, she could not possibly improve enough in that short time to compensate. Kaori ultimately ends up getting eliminated before long, though.
<ul><li> In a more individual case on the flip side of this trope, Maho, who can imitate anyone's "special ability" for a single turn each day, nevertheless has many bad habits, such as revealing that she has no yaku, or trying to pick up a tile when doing so would get her penalized, despite having practiced for a year, and she's referred to as an "eternal beginner."

This is exactly why she's interested in it. The manga otherwise has much the same attitude towards this trope as <em>Holyland</em> above: A good MMA fighter needs to have talent, training <em>and</em> experience. Natsuo has the talent, which is why she has the potential to be great at it. Her erstwhile rival Yuzuko has an expert coach and lots of training experience and hard work behind her, while Yuzuko's best friend Ringo adds a natural talent for the sport on top of it.

</li><li> Invoked, but ultimately averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em>. When she first joined the Kaleido Stage, the smug, arrogant May Wong believed she could charm her idols Leon and Layla and become a star without even trying. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> when Leon deliberately drops her during an act as a test of strength, badly injuring her in the process, and when Layla tells her that while her performances are technically good, they're completely soulless and not actually focused on entertaining the audience, thus meaning she'll have to start from scratch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PingPong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PingPong">Ping Pong</a></em>: Sakuma puts in ten times the effort of all the other major characters combined to excel at table tennis, but his astigmatism and lack of natural talent prevents him from ever surpassing them. His crappy attitude doesn't help matters, and gives Smile reason to utterly crush him when they face off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> plays with this.
<ul><li> Exaggerated to parodic levels with Saitama's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Super Toughness</a> coming from, according to himself, from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">doing one hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a ten kilometre run every day for three years</span>, which is all <em>anyone</em> needs to do in order to be able to punch holes in buildings and win every fight with a single punch. Everyone treats this as exactly as stupid as it sounds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There are implications that Saitama's incredible strength may be some supernatural ability that was somehow unlocked by obsessively training to be a hero. Although the true nature of his power remains a mystery.</span>
</li><li> For anyone <em>not</em> named Saitama, this gets ping-ponged everywhere. Some of the most powerful S-Class Heroes achieved their rank through honing their swordsmanship (Atomic Samurai), martial arts (Bang), physical training (Superalloy Darkshine and Flashy Flash), while others used methods like technology (Metal Knight, Genos, Child Emperor) to close the gap. The strongest shown S-Class Hero (Tatsumaki) was born with her incredibly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">esper</a> abilities, but it's not entirely clear how much of it is purely innate and how much was honed through training (though she's still leagues stronger than Fubuki <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Psykos</span>, both of whom were explicitly born with weaker abilities and trained much harder than her to maximize them, but still can't match her for sheer power). Monsters that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">were once humans</a> could have transformed from becoming so obsessed in a particular field they transformed, or they short-cutted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with monster cells</span>.
</li><li> Garō plays with this harder than anyone. He <em>has</em> trained and much of his power comes from his sheer mastery of martial arts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">incorporating new techniques from others</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">while fighting them</a>. On the other hand, the reason he's gained so much power so quickly is that he seems to possess an innate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">Came Back Strong</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility">Adaptive Ability</a> that makes him stronger the more damage he takes fighting strong opponents.
</li><li> This actually gets lampshaded and defied when Flashy Flash (who proudly claims he achieved his abilities by training harder than anyone else in his village) fights two strong ninja from the village that used monsterization as a shortcut to greater power over training further. While incredibly fast and powerful while transformed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">they still hadn't fully mastered their new abilities</a> and are ultimately cut down by Flash, who notes that if they had <em>trained</em> themselves to that level of power, they would have stood a chance of defeating him.

Then seemingly played straight when Sailor Moon finds her resolve and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">kills everyone with one attack</a>... Except the manga side stories show that the workaholic Sailor Venus has been training her, it just hadn't been shown in the main story.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted <em>hard</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em> with Zeon. He has the same lightning spells as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Zatch only Zeon has also undergone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>. The end result is he kicks the crap out of Zatch so badly it takes Zatch's partner Kiyo having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Answer Talker</a> superpower to even stand a chance. Zeon wins anyway through another aversion of the trope, his own partner Dufort has the same Answer Talker, only where Kiyo awoke it an hour ago he's been practicing it for years and naturally outclasses Kiyo by a large margin. When Zatch is about to undergo his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, he's told to not even bother trying to imitate Zeon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> abilities; it took Zeon years to get those down and Zatch just doesn't have the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a></em>, Naoki Shinjyo works hard to win races and two F3 championships to get to Cyber Formula racing. Yet he gets constantly beaten by Hayato, a 14-year-old rookie with no experience in motor racing and it leads him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blame others for his failures in racing</a>. It takes Miki to straighten him up and realize that his obsession of training hard and being the best clouds his ability as a racer. By then, Shinjyo regains his love for racing.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>, where every single exceptionally skilled chef is constantly shown to be making improvements to their cooking styles and that even if they are "gifted", the moment when they stop trying to improve is when their skills begin to stagnate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Soma</a> even points out in the beginning of the series that even if the other students have been studying fine cuisine since middle school, he's been cooking in the kitchen for <em>twelve</em> years and definitely outperforms a significant portion of the student body as a result. Despite being among the best students in the whole school, Soma is always finding ways to improve his recipes and continues to aim to overcome the handful of students that are better than him.
<ul><li> This is shown to be the underlying relationship between Soma and his father Joichirou. While Joichirou was considered to be the most talented member of the Polar Star Dorm, he considers his son to be the better image of a chef that would surpass himself. The reason is that while his son was nowhere near as talented as he was in his youth, it is his greater sense of hard work and perseverance that made him a better chef.
<ul><li> Double Subverted with regards to Nene. She failed because she worked hard, but at the wrong things. As the heir to an ancient and proud culinary tradition, she focused on learning to cook her forbears' recipes to perfection, but never regarded how her customers would regard those dishes, or how they could be improved or adapted to different circumstances.
</li><li> Jouichirou's own tenure at Tootsuki can be considered a Deconstruction. The people around him chalked up Jouichirou's successes to his "innate genius" and pushed him to greater and greater heights while failing to see the immense amounts of hard work that went into everything he accomplished. In the end, Jouichirou worked himself into a near-complete breakdown trying to live up to people's expectations, and eventually had to leave Tootsuki to maintain some semblance of sanity.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Played with and ultimately averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>. Class 3E's hard work does pay off at the very end with every student making the top fifty spots in the school, but the weakest student in the class (Terasaka) stays the weakest academically and Karma, who is naturally gifted, stays at the top. It's in comparison to the rest of the school that they gained, not so much in comparison to each other.
<ul><li> Karma managed to place thirteenth in the entire school for the first term's finals without even studying...but this is treated as failure since <em>everyone knew he could have done better if he tried</em>, having been fourth place on the midterms. It's only when he studies that he can claim the top spot in the school.
</li><li> The four class slackers decide to place top of a subject in the midterms...in the elective of home ec; which is then subverted as it's revealed they would have had to have studied past testing trends to score so well on such a subjective course and thus worked just as hard as their classmates. The other top scorers are all noted as having natural talent in their preferred subjects on top of their studying.
</li><li> Class A has an advantage due to being more naturally gifted in the style of study promoted by the school and having special cram sessions. During the second finals, A Class trains <em>too hard</em> and end up burning out by the latter half of the tests since they can't sustain their energy anymore.
</li><li> Played straighter in regards to assassination techniques. No matter how hard he tries, Karma is simply not the natural assassin Nagisa is; for all his raw strength and brains Karma cannot master the elements of surprise and the speed Nagisa has at his disposal. Nagisa not acknowledging his natural talent actually acts as a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for Karma in the class civil war.
</li></ul></li><li> Shirogane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> averts or subverts this, depending on how one looks at it. In his own estimation, he has zero natural talent, and the only reason he holds the #1 spot in academia is because of the constant effort put into studying. It's been shown that he's from below average to downright atrocious when it comes to some mundane activities, including ones that any other individual wouldn't have had trouble performing reasonably well at without prior training (aside from, weirdly enough, juggling). It also takes tremendous amount of work, along with a skilled instructor to bring his skills in those areas to about normal level. On the other hand, he is quick-witted and can come up with plans on the spot, holds multiple national certifications in different fields, manages to keep in balance his domestic routine, three part-time jobs and rather demanding studying sessions at the same time, eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets accepted into extremely selective Stanford University (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradeSkipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradeSkipper">at an accelerated rate at that</a>)</span>, and most importantly, <strong>always</strong> succeeds exponentially in self-improvement (becoming average at something may not sound extraordinary, but when you start below figurative "zero", it's a whole other story). All of that suggests he might be very special human being.
</li><li> Averted hard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru">All Rounder Meguru</a></em>: while talent is an important element, not only it takes many hours of rigorous training to assimilate techniques, it's made clear that the biggest difference between a normal amateur and both professional MMA fighters and amateurs planning to go pro is physical strength that can be obtained only through hard training-and that goes for any martial art
<ul><li> Meguru has a talent for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">analyzing his opponents' techniques, strengths and weaknesses and get the right timing to put them at disadvantage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">easily learning techniques used on him</a>, but before he could use his talent he had to go through a very long, repetitive and hard training to learn the basics and through many painful spars with Maki to learn the clinch. He also needs more work than average to keep his physical strength, and that is why, in spite of being a lightweight (up to 65 kg) coming from karate, his usual trainer is Nabe, a middleweight (up to 77 kg) <em>wrestler</em> who works him to the bone.
</li><li> Momoko is a genius judoka who quickly learns ju-jitsu, but would always skip reinforcement training. Because of that, every time she takes part in a tournament she <em>always</em> loses in the semifinals or finals due being too tired.
</li><li> Mitsuya is well known for his talent, even having been a candidate for the <em>Olympic games</em> and was expected to win the All Japan Amateur Shooto Tournament-but due his exceptional talent he failed to take things seriously, and that cost him both his chance for the Olympic games and the qualification for the national tournament, in the latter case losing (barely) to Meguru in the finals of the Kansai tournament. He has learned from his defeat, and at the Kanto Open Tournament he mops the floor with Yudai (noted to be almost Meguru's better in grappling and his overall equal).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Touch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Touch">Touch</a></em>: Averted in Tatsuya's case. Although he is an amazing natural athlete, even better than Kazuya, years without exercising or practicing mean that when he eventually joins the baseball team he has to train hard to even come close to his brother's standard, let alone surpass him. Played straight, however, with Minami, who goes from not being particularly interested in gymnastics to winning a championship very quickly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, this gets played straight before being subverted. Protagonist Izuku Midoriya hoped to become a hero like his idol, All Might, even though he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer">Quirkless</a>. But the day he meets All Might, the hero flat out tells Izuku that being a superhero is impossible without a Quirk because it's simply too dangerous of a job. But after being chosen as the successor of One For All and entering U.A., he works his butt off more than anyone else to catch up to his classmates who have had their powers their entire lives. His efforts pay off, becoming one of the best fighters in his class, giving him excellent grades, as well as a newfound respect from his peers that he never had when he was Quirkless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidouTenshiAngelicLayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidouTenshiAngelicLayer">Kidou Tenshi Angelic Layer</a></em> outright states that experience doesn't matter in the Angelic games, and that the deus' love for their Angels is far more important than the Angels' parameters and strengths. At the start of the Manga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> Misaki knows nothing about Angels, but quickly becomes the champion of the Kanto regional tournament while suffering almost no losses, defeating many much more experienced Dei in the process.

He is utterly hated by his teammate Engineer, who grew up in a poor, unexceptional family and had to work her ass off to be deemed worthy of becoming the new Engineer.

On the other hand, when she later encounters her ancestor, Witchbreaker, who has a much more powerful version of the staff and <em>decades</em> more experience, she is handily schooled.

</li><li> It is sometimes shown that Wally is a brilliant worker when he wants to be, but this is practically never, because he's realized something that Alice hasn't: effort doesn't pay off in a company that steals all your achievements without granting you slightest recognition, and the management doesn't recognise the difference between a lazy slob and a devout employee.
<ul><li> Wally is based on a real-life individual that Scott Adams knew. Wally was a brilliant worker who gamed the system so that he got the best outcome from minimal effort. Specifically, he figured out that the buyout for layoffs was better than the retirement package, so he made a dedicated effort to be useless without actually getting fired. According to Adams, he succeeded.

<ul><li> This happens quite a bit with Po from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> movies, largely because he is the Dragon Warrior, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>.
<ul><li> In the first movie, the Furious Five and Tai Lung had to train for years, if not decades, to become as powerful and as skilled as they are. All Po requires is the proper motivation and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a> that couldn't take more than a week or two. It helps that his particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxOnWaxOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxOnWaxOff">tailored specifically to his psychology</a>. He <em>is</em> a talented learner, and has incredible stamina and willpower as shown when the Five cream him one after the other and he <em>asks for more!</em> Natural immunity to Tai Lung's instant-KO special move doesn't hurt either. Additionally, both the dumpling battle with Shifu and the final battle with Tai Lung show that Po did not defeat Tai Lung simply through matching him in techniques (it would be impossible in such a time frame) but by engaging him in a battle of wits and skill, such as using the environment and unorthodox methods as well as a distracting measure (the Dragon Scroll). He was helped by Tai Lung losing his usual perceptiveness and tactical thinking due to his initial arrogance and ongoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>. By the time Tai Lung focused more on killing Po than getting the Dragon Scroll for himself, he's taken a fair amount of embarrassment and damage from Po, and is mentally crushed by the Dragon Scroll's revelation, allowing Po to put his newfound skills and immunity to nerve strikes to good use and own him.
</li><li> In a sense it's inverted with Po and the Furious Five and Tai Lung. Tai Lung and the Furious Five (as revealed in <em>Secrets of the Furious Five</em>) all had natural strength and ability even before they started training with Shifu and Oogway (with the possible exception of Crane). Po's talent wasn't very obvious at first but was eventually discovered through the hard work he <em>did</em> perform.
</li><li> In the sequel Shifu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">expresses exasperation that Po has managed to learn inner peace at such a young age when he himself didn't manage it until the end of the first movie, by which point he was already an old man.

Po on the other hand, upon learning said trauma, forces himself to face it much sooner for the sake of helping his friends and getting past it.

Daniel also didn't start from scratch, as he is mentioned to have taken basic classes before the film starts, and trains all day, everyday one-on-one with an instructor, instead of as part of a class.

In the first sequel Daniel gets a sobering wake-up call when he gets in a fight with a more experienced practitioner of the same style and gets his ass effortlessly handed to him.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Generation Iron</em> a documentary about the top modern bodybuilders. During the documentary, there is a focus on the rivalry between fan favorite and peoples champion Kai Greene, and the seemly cocky and Hollywood acting Phil "The Gift" Heath. Called The Gift because of his body being genetically natural for bodybuilding, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s physique. During the segments, Greene often talked about how hard works beats natural talent. However, Heath responded with: " But what if natural talent decides to work hard?" It all comes to a climax at the Mr. Olympia competition. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In which Phil Health's out-poses Kai Greene and wins the Mr. Olympia title with Greene finishing second.

<ul><li> Not hardly any training, he was trained in the use of the quarterstaff by his father, who was the best in their hometown. It also helped that the swordsmen were underestimating him...and that the Warder instructor noted "a farmer with a quarterstaff" was the only man to defeat the greatest swordsman in history, suggesting the clash of styles worked in Mat's favor.
</li><li> He had to work hard to get good at the quarterstaff, but as for the army management...in his first large-scale battle (where he has any command) he takes a group of essentially new recruits and carves his way through an <em>ambush</em> laid by <em>overwhelming numbers</em> of the <em>best warriors in the world</em>.

There had to be a good reason for Pataki to stir and training wasn't one of them."

Anyone gifted with sorcery will still need years of training to truly master the art, and even near the end of the second series, he's still getting plenty of pointers from his elders. He is a lot more powerful than a sorcerer of his age should be, but that's largely thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">the Orb</a> and his acknowledged status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">the Child of Light</a> rather than any innate ability. It's also worth noting that in his final battle with Torak, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sorcery has nothing to do with it- it is his willpower, and rejection of Torak, that grants him victory.</span>
<ul><li> Of course, not every sorcerer is privy to the full details of his unique status, so there is some confusion when he pulls of feats he probably shouldn't be able to.
</li><li> At the start of the next series he causes problems due to large power and little training a few times. He stops a battle of knights by creating a lightning storm and a few months later, an irate Belgarath calls him some fun names while informing him that the disciples (all old sorcerers) spent months fixing the world's weather. He also, with the help of the orb, blows up a gate in a city his army is attacking. As he is angry the orb gets enthusiastic and the gate with part of the wall disappear as the explosion is THAT big. Parts of the wall land kilometers out to sea as well.

Give Neville a reason to work, and he will give you results. When Bellatrix Lestrange escaped from Azkaban Neville was given sufficient reason to become a fighter; his subsequent focus and training caused him to improve himself almost as fast as <em>Hermione</em> and Harry considered this sudden change to be quite alarming. This was also the book in which it was revealed he'd been using a wand that hadn't chosen him meaning he'd had the distinct disadvantage of dealing with a wand that was fighting him this whole time.

Gage's father died in a lab accident because of his unceasing efforts to avert this — to demonstrate such inventing genius that they would accept him — and Gage is following in his footsteps.

He started in the mailroom of Wolfram &amp; Hart and worked his butt off to become a good lawyer, while the Senior Partners just <em>gave</em> Angel the position of CEO overnight.

At one point she was really powerful and not unfriendly to the main cast, what with them saving her from being trapped in her mom's body. Fast forward five seasons: Willow is now the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, and Amy is royally pissed that Willow (who wasn't even aware magic existed until the age of sixteen) has more magic in her pinky than it took Amy, an already accomplished mage, years of training to get. In her words, most <em>born</em> magic users nowadays have to "work twice as hard to be half as good" was Willow, who picked up witchcraft during high school.
<ul><li> She's also rather upset that Willow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>attempted to destroy the world</em></span> and didn't get more than a slap on the wrist and some friendly counseling.
</li><li> The whole "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">stuck as a rat</a>" issue probably didn't help her attitude either.
<ul><li> However, in almost all of the Amy episodes up to this point Willow is not shown to really be stronger. Amy seems to be incredibly powerful when she can turn people into rats, and at the same time Willow complains about being able to barely levitate a pencil. Willow is complimented on her magical abilities in Season Five just for having the ability to summon a little lightning and magically throw knives. Willow seems to get her magical upgrade in Season Six from Rack. While it may be argued that she was stronger at that point, she had three more years of training while Amy was still a rat yet Amy's complaint in Season Seven was that Willow was "always" stronger.

Sure Prue was a cheerleader in high school but she worked in a museum and an auction house in her adult years. Though this averted with regards to the sisters' powers as they are shown developing slowly over the course of the series. Though Prue's develop faster than her sisters' do.

His opponents can throw a fireball that can destroy a building, but many of them don't know how to defend against a cross hook, maintain a perfect stance, or outmaneuver an opponent who fights dirty.

</li><li> This is true of Nasuverse mages in general, at least in the case of the Magic Association.

</li><li> 4) Protoman is a program. He can't really "train", as he doesn't have anything to develop.
</li><li> 5) The only thing Protoman could conceivably fight for ten hours are viruses.

<ul><li> How hard a worker Marisa is may depend on how you interpret "steals a lot of stuff", though. You didn't think she developed the Master Spark herself, did you?
</li><li> It's stated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Perfect Cherry Blossom's manual</a> that Reimu does not believe that effort will be rewarded (so much so that her shrine's paper fortune does not carry the fortune "Least Luck," which can be interpreted as "You will get exactly as your effort").

<ul><li> Even before that, though, Lunarians are considered something fierce. Houraisan Kaguya is the kind of person you'd expect to give no effort at all and, though her spellcards are considered to be not so difficult by decent players, she has more cards than any other boss in any of the games.
</li></ul></li><li> Reversed with Meiling. The character who is said to train the most (and be in a position to be challenged more often than others) can never claim canon combat success over anyone.

A bit into the story, though, a daemon tricks our guy, and he ends up becoming weak and forgetting everything he learned. Starting from Level 1 again, now the hard work (and not just hard work with the ladies, of which there are a lot in the story) hacking up monsters...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, it takes a lot of practice to become a good Spy, possibly the most practice of any class. Spy's best counter? The Pyro, a class that can be used fairly effectively with almost no practice.
<ul><li> In fact, all of the classes except the Spy and perhaps the Scout can be used at least somewhat effectively with a small amount of practice.
</li><li> This can be mostly attributed to the fact that the spy isn't effective at straight-up fighting like all the other classes, just about all of his tactics revolve around being behind enemy lines, being unnoticed, destroying structures, and backstabs. All things that usually amount to pass/fail - hence a bad spy dies either failing to get anything done or before they can even try, while any other class playing poorly can at least get some shots in at the enemy team.

<ul><li> In theory. In practice, the series demonstrates the professional soldiers who have trained for years are MUCH weaker than a bunch of amateurs who have just joined the army, the point where even one of their newbies can beat several enemy soldiers at a time. The sequel makes this worse, where veterans are easily outgunned and outclassed by the supposed academy's failure class, none of whom can keep up with the fresh-faced 16-18-year-olds, aside from a few boss characters, marked out by their own special talents. And the leader maybe a careless idiot who doesn't understand and doesn't even try to understand tactics, rushes into situations and laughs in the face of a danger in a way that would get his unit violently wiped out in a real war, but dam if he doesn't completely overwhelm the enemy, even they outnumber him 6 to 1 or more!

Before exams, you'll need to have studied quite regularly to get the most out of it, and one of the characters in <em>Persona 3</em> even tells you that studying a bit each day rather than just cramming will go further.
</li><li> Played straight at one point in <em>3</em> though. You can try talking to distressed Junpei a few days before the exams, which makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">sarcastically note that it seems the only thing you do is just walk around talking to people</a>...which you actually find yourself doing. And given the protagonist really seems to be successful in whatever he does, you can totally understand Junpei's grudge. And thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, at least in Persona 3, you get to keep all your progress in academics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em> zigzags this, as it does work largely like "any RPG" as mentioned above - you go from normal high school student (or magazine editor, or cop, or whatever) to monster-slaying, god-enslaving, world-saving badass in what might generously be two weeks. However, some of your biggest foes are other people who have been granted immense power... and used it as a crutch to lord over others. So all your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">hard work</a> lets you kick them in the face. Seemingly played straight again at the end of <em>Innocent Sin</em>, where you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beat up Nyarlathotep, except shortly thereafter Nyarlathotep reveals he was just playing down to your level and isn't remotely inconvenienced, then goes on to end the world while you just stand by exhausted from the fight. No, you didn't just Punch Out Cthu- er, Nyarlathotep like you thought you did, and it takes another god's intervention to turn back time</span>. Played more straight in the end of <em>Eternal Punishment</em>, though the hard work <em>has</em> been put in twice over by some people, this time. Though all this is probably Justified because the collective unconscious is reshaping the world, meaning heroes can rise up out of nothing because enough people believe they can.
</li><li> <em>Persona 5</em> has an example in Ann and Mika. Both of them are popular models, but Mika has to follow a careful diet and exercise regime to maintain her looks, whereas Ann doesn't do any of that and even eats cakes and sweets whenever she feels like it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But ultimately zig-zagged during Ann's major social event when she tries to land a serious modeling gig against Mika. Yeah, Ann is lucky with her fast metabolism, but doesn't understand that it takes more than looks to be a top model. She also needs to have good social skills, charm, persuasiveness, the ablity to pose in all the right angles, and a competitive edge. Because Mika took modeling seriously, she had all these traits and wins the audition. Afterwards, Ann promises to take modeling more seriously and work hard at it.</span>

Before performing the technique, he'll mention that it took him years to become so accomplished and that age caught up to him before he could fully realize his dream. He's moved to tears upon witnessing Link execute it flawlessly in a matter of seconds. This trope is also played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> where the Hero's Shade teaches the new Link several techniques called the "Hidden Skills."

</li><li> It should be noted that Link has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">Leaked Experience</a> from all his past lives. The first Links had to train long and hard, but the later ones retain it in a manner similar to muscle memory. It should also be noted Link wasn't exactly goofing off to get those ten Knight's Crests.

She was initially fiercely jealous of Link for so easily being chosen by the Master Sword when she's worked for years to awaken her own powers to no avail. It's heavily implied in-game that her father forcing her to try and awaken said powers by constantly praying to Hylia and putting immense pressure on her is what stopped her from awakening them sooner. Not only does hard work hardly work, but it was also quite likely actually impeding her!

However while Andy spent years abroad honing his skill and training under the Shiranui style of ninjitsu, Terry trolled the streets of Southtown and just mastered fighting the old fashioned way. Come time for them to compare skills, Terry's "do what works" background ended up giving him the superior fighting talents. Sometimes this gets under Andy's skin but it's not enough to ruin their relationship.

The battle part is justified in that Sans <em>cheats</em> with the mechanics of the game. By the game's stats, he only has one attack point and one defense point, implying that his lack of work really <em>does</em> result in him being weaker... on paper. In-game, he gets around the latter by simply side-stepping attacks, which no other enemy does, and he gets around the former with a combination of bypassing Mercy Invincibility and overly long attacks that require fast reflexes to dodge.</span>
</li><li> A recurring theme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> franchise is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">proving this trope wrong</a>.

Vaarsuvius (the party's resident elven Wizard) complains that it took him/her over a hundred years to learn how to cast the most basic of spells, yet Elan is acquiring that knowledge almost instantaneously with one simple decision.
<ul><li> Later inverted when Xykon talks about how he is more powerful than Vaarsavius due in part to hard work, but also due in part to who he is and the nature of power—power that can be taken away easily isn't power at all, whereas power that is made inherent and immutable to the self is the only real power.
<ul><li> However, it's played straight on another occasion: Vaarsuvius nearly works him/herself to death trying to break through the Cloister and find Haley, while Elan and Durkon mostly just sit around waiting for the problem to solve itself. In the end, all the hard work accomplished almost nothing in regards to finding Haley, because she had contacted them and Durkon was actually the first to know. This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> for three reasons: V was doing so much hard work and not resting at all, because he/she was still feeling guilty about something done recently and didn't want to have nightmares; no one short of an epic spellcaster could penetrate the Cloister, period; and an idea that <em>should</em> have worked didn't because of something that was not his fault (i.e., his friends were hungry).
</li><li> <em>On The Origin of PCs</em> contains an example noted above in Tabletop Games: Haley convinces V to try adventuring because a few months of level-appropriate encounters will have him/her picking up new levels and spells faster than <em>decades</em> of sitting around and actually studying magic. Of course, battling monsters on a daily basis is certainly "hard work", but the levels you gain can go toward improving <strong>anything</strong>. Haley mentions that one adventure somehow caused her skill at lockpicking to go up, even though she never encountered a lock.
</li><li> Similarly played straight with Crystal, Haley's rival.

Mozenrath had studied extensively for decades, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">given up his own right hand for power</a>, and here comes this guy with an <em>all-powerful genie</em> at his side, and the kid doesn't even seem to realize that it's unusual!

<ul><li> Katara feels this way when Aang masters Waterbending seemingly without trying when she's been self-training for years. This is lampshaded partly in the numerous references to past Avatars—Roku notes to a hesitant teacher that the Avatar has <em>already</em> mastered the elements a thousand times, which means learning them might be more like remembering something you forgot a long time ago. In addition, Katara <em>was</em> self-teaching, but Aang immediately benefited from everything she learned. When they both get some supervised training from a true Master, she learns much faster because he doesn't take it very seriously: Katara makes enough progress in <em>days</em> for said master (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">Straw Misogynist</a> who only changed his tune after a near-defeat and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy">Epiphany Therapy</a>) to <em>declare her a Master in turn.</em> Lesson: being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">Determined</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">Prodigy</a> is superior to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>. Zuko also laments to himself about things come so easily for Aang, just like for his sister, while he has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">constantly struggle</a> for anything he wants and loses so many times. In the end, however, this becomes Zuko's strength against Azula, as his determined nature allows him to bounce back from failure better than Azula does when Mai and Ty Lee do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> against her. It also gives him an advantage that was demonstrated as early as the third episode; he doesn't have the flashy or most powerful moves that more naturally skilled firebenders possess, but his superior mastery of the fundamentals can make up the difference.
</li><li> Per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, this is the point of bending in general. They wanted a magic system that you actually have to <em>work</em> at, rather than just being handed power. There are geniuses like Azula and Toph, but they still had to train. Even the Avatar, the local messiah, has to master each element individually every time they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnate</a>. In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Avatar State</a> is basically just accessing the experience of hundreds of Avatars at once, stacking thousands of years of training to cheat the system and do things that no one with a mortal lifespan could ever manage.

Tenzin studies spirit lore for <em>decades</em> and it gets him exactly nowhere in regards to actual spirits, yet his eleven-year-old daughter has a natural connection to the spirit world <em>and</em> sufficient Airbending skill that she's nearly as good as her father. On the other hand, while Zaheer can sledgehammer almost any bender in a one-on-one fight despite having only been one for a few months, it turns out this is because even before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harmonic Convergence</span> he was a talented martial artist and simply adapted his style to include <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">airbending</span>; he had also been reading the philosophy behind it for years beforehand by complete coincidence, and gets a lot of mileage from using extremely obscure abilities he learned of in this study. When he does come up against someone who has been studying the same bending style for decades, it's only the intervention of his allies that prevents <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tenzin</span> from destroying Zaheer.

</li><li> Frank Grimes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, rather darkly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.

When he attempts to humiliate Homer by entering him in a children's science project, the fact that he's still congratulated drives him insane and leads to his death.
<ul><li> A dramatic example occurs in "Bart Gets an F", where Bart actually <em>tries</em> to study for a test, and <em>still</em> gets an F. Fortunately, his knowledge of an obscure historical fact impresses Mrs. Krabappel enough to give him a D-.

Then Patrick, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, gets it on his first try, and unintentionally rubs in Spongebob's face for the rest of the episode, though Patrick is hardly the world's greatest driver.
<ul><li> Spongebob's inability to his get his liscence was from his nerves getting to him, as shown in an early episode. Patrick's clear-headedness allowed him to help Spongebob in nearly getting it (but it was cheating.) In this episode, Patrick ate Spongebob's informational index cards and retained the knowledge, allowing him to get the license.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Orpheus of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> is, despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> status in his personal life, one of the closest things to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> in the show. However it's shown this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">power came at a price</a>; his incredible dedication to his mystical profession and training lead to his wife divorcing him and has been a cause of major strife in his life. So when one fourth season episode has him shown up by the Outrider, the guy his wife has now hooked up with — he's <em>far</em> more powerful, and hasn't made nearly as many sacrifices to get his skill— he has a crisis. This trope is then subverted by revealing the Outrider <em>cheated</em>, he's "cyborged" a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">mystic artifact</a> into his brain... which ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">going horribly wrong.</a> However, the episode also points out the other side of the coin - though the Outrider took shortcuts rather than constantly training, it freed him up to actually spend time with his wife and stepdaughter, something that Orpheus was never able to balance out with his mystical duties. Ultimately, Orpheus has to admit that the Outrider is much happier and better-adjusted than he is.

<ul><li> Played with in "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000."

</li><li> It should be noted that Twilight zig-zags this trope; she spends her entire life studying magic to the exclusion of all else (except friendship) to become as powerful as she is, but Celestia took her on as a student <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">because she already knew the significance of Twilight's Cutie Mark and set her on the path to fulfilling it</a>.

</li><li> Also played with then subverted in "Hurricane Fluttershy".

Later, when it all on the line, Fluttershy proved the training really paid off, as she is able to fly faster than anyone and complete the tornado. Turns out Fluttershy was holding back because she remembered the torment other Pegasus did to her when she was younger and was afraid to fail.</span>
</li><li> In "The Cutie Map", Twilight copies Starlight Glimmer's shield spell after seeing it once. Starlight complains that it took her years to learn it.
</li><li> This is later inverted in "The Cutie Remark", where Starlight Glimmer matches Twilight Sparkle, a pony who has saved Equestria multiple times and spent her entire life learning magic, in combat, and also manages to create a powerful, unprecedented time spell.
</li><li> Unicorns as a whole exemplify this trope. Characters like Starlight Glimmer can have borderline god-tier powers even if they <em>never</em> practice or train in magic merely because they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a> or let their emotions get the better of them, while characters like Trixie and Sunburst can spent their entire lives training in magic but be lackluster at it simply because they weren't born with innate power and there's nothing they can do about it.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Anyone reading this section should note that this trope is very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in real life. There's nuances in nearly every case where this trope may come into play and the trope itself is a sensitive issue for many so expect that YMMV applies for each example.
</li><li> This is the case with many professionals or aspiring pros, especially athletes and musicians, etc. In the case of athletes, overtraining can wreck your body and cause burnout. In most cases with music, overpractising can lead to voice fatigue in singers, tendonitis or muscle damage in keyboardists, string players and even conductors, and damaging muscles in the area of the mouth for wind instrumentalists, particularly those who play brass instruments. It's a bit of a balancing act—if you don't work hard enough, you won't reach the heights, but if you work too hard, you'll hurt yourself and your training will suffer while you're injured.
<ul><li> Also, it should be worth mentioning that this trope can be invoked if one practices or trains, but doesn't use their time efficiently - i.e. a basketball player who is really good at free throws should still practice free throws, but probably not to the extent that the rest of their game suffers or doesn't get developed.
</li><li> This is also true with Bodybuilders, Powerlifters, or any athletic pracitce that focuses on building lots of muscle to compete. Every person has an area on the body that is easy to grow muscularly, not taking many sets of reps to get a serious pump, which turns into gains during rest and muscle repair. There is also an area of the body that is the weakest and needs the most work during weekly training. This is why most pros will tell beginners, find the weak part of the body and focus on building that more than the strong part, because spending too much time of the strong area of the body is mostly a waste of time, outside of a standard set to keep it toned.
</li><li> Another point: some people are, well, genetic freaks and unusually well-suited to some tasks, athletic or otherwise. You can build up your lung capacity, but you cannot train to have the build of, say, Michael Phelps who is apparently proportioned <em>exactly</em> as well as any human can be for swimming (large upper body, proportionally short legs). You can build up your leg strength to jump higher and build up your muscle mass to make you stronger and heavier, but you cannot work yourself to being as tall as Shaquille O'Neal. (Which is something of a saying in basketball; "You can't teach height.") You can improve your flexibility, but you can't <em>make</em> your joints double-jointed if they're not already. You can be anything you want to be, but that doesn't mean you'll be good at it.
<ul><li> Neither genetic gifts nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> can grant a human being the ability <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">to shrug off the laws of physics or biology</a>. Example: throughout the world, men like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariusz_Pudzianowski">Mariusz Pudzianowski<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had worked themselves through hellish training, diet and exercise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">to be able to raise cars or pull trucks, railcars or planes</a>, but none of them, regardless of training or muscles, would be able to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">a comparatively small econobox car</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">running towards him with bare hands</a>. It's a matter of physics, size, weight and ultimately flesh against metal. Metal always wins.
</li><li> This is also the crack in the edifice of life-coaching: the likes of Tony Robbins they repeat so often, so hard and so convincing their stuff is magic and grants magic powers, people may soon believe it is, which is not the case. Barbara Ehrenreich has much to say about life coaching in her book <em>Bright Sided</em>.
</li><li> The book "Talent is Overrated" gives a good reason for this trope: People tend to work on what they're already good at while avoiding what they're weak at. For instance, they researched elite figure skaters and sub-elite ones. The elite ones practiced moves that required a ton of falling and standing up and constantly getting out of their comfort zones (called "deliberate practice"). The sub-elite would constantly practice the moves they had already mastered (normal practice).
</li><li> This was the rationale in the early '70s for putting children with high reading comprehension on a math and science track while tracking mathematically gifted children into English. Supposedly it developed will power and discouraged "laziness".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope seems to go all the way to the Medieval ages when longbow archers were considered a very valuable commodity in the battlefield. There was even a saying that speaks of the amount of work it takes to train an archer, effectively saying "If you want to train the best archer in the world, start with his grandfather." Part of the reason guns revolutionized warfare was that they didn't have the range or speed of longbows, but you only needed a few weeks to teach a peasant conscript to use it.
</li><li> Some researchers have discovered a "10,000-hour rule", which was discussed by author Malcolm Gladwell in his book <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">''Outliers''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In effect, to be really good at a skill, a person has to work on it for approximately 10,000 hours. People whom we refer to as "experts" either started young (e.g. Mozart) or if they were able to achieve greatness over a short period of time (only a few years instead of decades), they practiced or worked intensely (e.g. the Beatles). One might still argue that some people might have an innate ability to maintain mental focus for longer, or sleep less than others and thus have more waking hours to work with, but that doesn't disprove the rule. Of course this is assuming a human being without any severe disabilities — one can probably safely assume that a double amputee isn't going to play in the NBA no matter how many hours of practice he puts in, except in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Prosthetics</a>, of course, but they have actually opened up another aspect of this; some of the prosthetic limbs are now being examined to see if they would actually grant handicapped athletes an unfair advantage over ordinary and less efficient human limbs.
<ul><li> Gladwell has pointed out in interviews that it's often overlooked that his point about 10,000 hours is meant to support a larger point: No one could possibly devote 10,000 hours of work to a single task unless they have a solid support system in place. Practice may make perfect, but it doesn't pay the bills.
</li></ul></li><li> For college graduates entering the job market, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma">very fine line</a>. If you devote your time and energy into schoolwork, you're going to have trouble finding a job because you have little work experience. If you get a part-time job and work hard at it, you won't get hired because your grades are slipping. If you manage to hit that sweet spot of grades, internships, part-time work, and extracurricular activities, you might end up being overqualified for any entry-level job you apply to (and might not get the job since you're supposed to be paid in proportion to your abilities). Quite a few career counselors basically tell student now that grades and experience don't matter nearly as much as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">networking</a>.
<ul><li> On the other end of the scale, there are also those who have worked for years in a given industry, only for it to be made obsolete by advancing technology. The workers find their skills are of little use since the new industries involved require different skill sets to the old ones. And none more so than the ICT sector, due to its inherently fast-changing nature.
</li></ul></li><li> In a non-exercise or training version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne">Laurence Fishburne</a>'s daughter made headlines when she decided she wanted to become famous, but didn't want to go through all that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingTheirDues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingTheirDues">Paying Their Dues</a> stuff. So, taking a page from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>, she released a sex tape and hoped that would attract attention. You better believe Dear Old Dad wasn't happy.
<ul><li> It also didn't work. Most people nowadays don't even remember when Fishburne's daughter made a sex tape, or if he has a daughter at all.
</li></ul></li><li> That one friend, who never really seems to spend much time studying or doing his/her work, but always gets perfect grades and seems to be good at everything... is probably working his butt off whenever he's alone, and just doesn't complain about it as much. Or alternatively, has learned a studying style that suits them the best at a young age. This is especially relevant in high school and studies progressing beyond that. Or maybe they're just naturally talented. The problem with talent being there eventually becomes a wall where only talent isn't enough.
<ul><li> Another possibility: not mentioning the working their butts off because it seems more awesome to just be "a natural".
</li><li> Or the inverse of that. The person who is naturally talented at everything and so is bored quickly and unwilling to put in the work to go from good to great. These people tend to end up as the jack of all trades. An older jack of all trades can pick up new things incredibly quickly as once you have a broad basic and intermediate skill set, it's more about putting existing knowledge into new areas.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">Double Subverted</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison">Thomas Edison</a> and his maxim <em>Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration</em>. Edison was known for his "brute force" approach on innovation. That is because <em>he had absolutely no knowledge on engineering theory nor sciences</em> and he simply repeated and repeated the experiment and tried something different until it worked. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, his bitter rival, stated <em>If Edison had had any theoretical knowledge on how things work, he would have made with one-tenth of the work</em>.
</li><li> You can work hard your entire life and never be as rich as the guy who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">inherited his father's banking fortune</a>.
<ul><li> Wealth still has to be managed properly though, there's a reason most lottery winners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted">go broke in a short time</a>.
<ul><li> Or heirs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichesToRags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichesToRags">destroy the family empire</a>. Just ask the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinberg%27s_%28supermarket%29">Steinberg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> family whose Canadian chain of grocery stores vanished a few years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">after the founder died</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> It's possible for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">untrained brawler</a> to defeat a skilled martial artist, but outside of the occasional lucky hit ending a fight, this is generally a matter of either the martial artist have trained to defend against a narrow range of attacks or the "untrained brawler" having years of fighting experience in informal venues.
<ul><li> Martial artists with tunnel vision tend to fall victim to this a lot; it's not at all uncommon for some random schlub to start a fight with a trained martial artist and get beaten, only to have the trained fighter get jumped by the other guy's buddies and beaten to a pulp (Dirty Coward). Toyed With: Numbers will overwhelm regardless of any mindset, but even Bruce Lee praised kickboxing's potential of defending against multiple opponents.
</li></ul></li><li> This may be the reason why American students tend to underperform in mathematics when compared to Asian students. Asian cultures usually have the attitude that anyone can be good at math (or anything else) if they put in enough effort, which leads to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">perfectionist Asian parent stereotype</a>. In contrast, Americans tend to believe that most people just don't have "the right type of brain" for math, and only a select few geniuses can be good at it, which tends to undermine people's confidence. The reality is that aside from people with actual number-processing difficulties (such as dyscalculia), most people can understand higher mathematics with a good teacher and some effort, essentially a mixture of the two.
<ul><li> However, the emergence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a> in East Asia, especially in Japan, is starting to expose the limitations of the "perfectionist Asian parent stereotype". It's also a reflection of Japan's "Lost Decade" following the bubble burst of the early 1990s.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted with Superstar boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. It's been often said one of the things that makes him a great boxer, isn't his polished offensive and defensive skills or his very high ring intelligence, but his reputation of being one of the hardest workers in the boxing gym. There are many <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTdqV8XkYNo">training videos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that highlight this. And Mayweather's favorite saying is: "Hard work. Dedication."
</li><li> Averted according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a>'s trope page.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Bruce Lee</strong>: "I fear not the man who has practiced ten thousand kicks once. But I fear the man who has practiced one kick ten thousand times."
</div></li><li> Averted in a big way with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">basketball</a> superstar Lebron James. During the Finals against the San Antonio Spurs in 2007, a seemingly unstoppable Lebron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">"King"</a> James got exposed when it was revealed during the series that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">couldn't make mid-range jump shots</a>. It got so bad that by Game 4, the Spurs intentionally let James shot from outside the paint, knowing he would miss - which he did. The Cleveland Cavaliers ended up getting swept and the destined new King of basketball was humiliated. Six years later and one championship under his belt, Lebron James, now a member of the Miami Heat, faced the San Antonio Spurs again in the Finals of the 2012-13 season. In Game 7 of a tough series, the Spurs once again forced Lebron James to shoot the ball from mid-range by covering the paint all series and not allowing him to drive to the basket - just like in 2007. Only this time, Lebron James made his shots and helped the Miami Heat win back-to-back champions. This was because after 2007, Lebron trained hard to become a better shooter and his shooting percentage kept increasing every year as a result. This was proven during the 2012-13 season when Lebron James made the most mid-range jump shots of his career during the regular season. This improvement helped him win a 4Th regular season MVP along with a Finals MVP for scoring 37 points in Game 7, mostly off of mid-range jumpers.
</li><li> Averted for most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalGaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalGaming">E-Sports professional gamers</a>. Many of them spent countless hours playing a game to master it before competing in tournaments. They often times do nothing but spend all day-and-night playing the same game, only pausing for bathroom breaks and eating. And some of them forget to eat altogether. They also eat a lot of sugar and drink a lot of caffeine or energy drinks to stay awake and lose countless hours of sleep. In the case of games where you pick separate characters (like fighting games) or classes (like shooters and role playing games), you'll have gamers spend thousands of hours playing one character or class, unlike most people who'll only play each class for a certain number of hours before getting bored and moving on to the next game.
</li><li> This is the reason the saying "Work Smarter, Not Harder" exists because if you're working hard, but not efficiently, you're not going to get very much done.
</li><li> Related to the above, this is the essence of the saying "If you want something done the easiest way possible, find the laziest employee you have and make him do it". He or she <em>will</em> find the easiest and most efficient means possible to get it done with as little work as humanly possible.
<ul><li> Averted, however, in that the task will probably not be done <em>well.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Can be Played Straight at first, then Averted in later life in the case of people with naturally high intelligence. In the early years of education, they're able to get away without studying much, or at all, relying on their natural ability to retain, process and regurgitate information learned in classrooms. As they get to higher learning, where research and independent study become necessary to succeed, students who didn't take the time to develop these skills will find themselves overtaken by (comparatively) less intelligent, but harder working peers.
</li><li> Australian comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMinchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMinchin">Tim Minchin</a>, at his 2013 honorary degree ceremony at the University of Western Australia, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc">delivered a speech<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about making it through university as being "all luck".
</li><li> A common way those with ADHD describe the disorder is "Twice the work, half the results" because their already below-average energy levels spend a large portion of said energy to actually keep them doing the thing they need to do. The medication helps by boosting the energy levels enough to compensate for this.
</li><li> The wealth disparity between high-ranking corporate executives and rank-and-file workers is sometimes cited as an example. CEOs are often paid several thousand times (or even more) than the average worker, even though it's not humanly possible for them to work thousands of times harder.
