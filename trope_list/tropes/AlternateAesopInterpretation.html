<ul><li> In Episode 11 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, "Toys in the Attic," an Alternative Aesop was acknowledged after Jet lost his money (and clothes) in a card game with Faye. The Aesop he learns from it is that people can achieve something only by honesty and hard work. Faye, however, sees it as a proof that everyone is out for themselves and only the smartest and strongest can survive. Throughout the episode, each character offers their own potential moral for the situation. By far the most sensible is Spike's take: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCameFromTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCameFromTheFridge">Don't leave things in the fridge</a>."</span> Another interpretation of Jet's situation at the beginning might be "Don't gamble against someone who you know cheats".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Pain Invasion arc. Was it supposed to be about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>, or, rather, "Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall"?
</li><li> Masashi Kishimoto, <em>Naruto</em>'s author, explained in an interview with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a>'s <em>Shonen Jump</em> that the overall message of the series is that using violence to stop conflicts is wrong and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">revenge only causes greater revenge.</a> While violence is portrayed in a less than totally glamorous manner in <em>Naruto</em>, and villains commonly use peace as an excuse for their plans, it does seem to go against the impulsive, always-eager-to-fight nature of its protagonist. Given how the outlandish superpowers and elaborate fight sequences are a big part of the draw, it also smacks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Do Not Do This Cool Thing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The moral of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> franchise is supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> but viewers have often wondered if the real moral is "Causing a war is bad, yes. But fighting a war defensively and against those who caused it, can be flat out heroic."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, the main characters read "Classroom of Truth," which deconstructs various shonen tropes such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> by, among other things, suggesting everyone is only looking out for themselves. However, they notice that the selfish characters died first, and wonder if it, in a way, is meant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconReconSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconReconSwitch">promote cooperation</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl">Daily Life with Monster Girl</a></em> has the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">'bigotry is bad'</a> aesop. It also shows, by the establishment of various flourishing extraspecies businesses, that legal immigration is <em>excellent</em> for the economy.
<ul><li> The introduction of Black Lily and the Broker shows us how (non-)human trafficking is rarely what the term makes us perceive it as, and same with its "resource gathering" if it is considered analogous to "sex work". It also shows that, in many ways, the problems in both institutions can be chalked up to the government regulating them without understanding them.
</li></ul></li><li> Although in Japan <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em> is supposed to be a commentary on shifting sexual dynamics, especially in regards to the relationship between the unassertive, carnivore male wolf Legoshi and the sexually liberated herbivore rabbit girl Haru, in the United States, the series is interpreted to be about race relations - especially since it became popular on the heels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em>, an American animated movie that <em>does</em> use the carnivore/herbivore dichotomy as a metaphor for race relations.

<ul><li> <em>Tricked</em> is a graphic novel in which we find out at the end of the story that the moral the surviving characters took from the plot was "guns are bad". But, the access Steve had to his deceased grandfather's guns was just dumb luck. Steve himself didn't know whether his grandmother had gotten rid of the guns until he was already there. By contrast, Steve's mental illness and erratic behavior was observed and commented upon by several characters in the story, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">they all decide it's not their issue</a> and let Steve go on his merry way. In terms of preventing the situation that makes up the climax of the book, better mental health awareness probably would have been a lot more help than gun control advocacy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a></em>, Usagi's master tells a young Usagi the story of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe">Honest Axe</a>, and asks him to interpret the moral. Since the villager received the gold axe, young Usagi proclaims the answer to be "honesty will be rewarded". His master points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">a gold axe is useless in cutting wood, and the villager died the next winter.</a> The lesson the master learned is "beware the gifts of those who bear you a grudge", which misses the tale's point entirely. Useless for cutting wood though the axe may be, being of solid gold, it can be melted down for a considerable amount of money.
</li><li> While ostensibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> plots filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executives</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">politicians</a>, Ed Brubaker's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong">Tom Strong</a></em> story "The Terrible True Life of Tom Strong", where Tom finds himself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">dream world</a> where his usual enemies are goverment agents hiding his existence from the world can also be read as a criticism of conspiracy theorists - Tom breaks out of his coma when he realizes that no world could be so completely controlled by hidden agendas and corrupt cabals.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Fairytales and Folklore </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The intended message of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> is to look past appearances and judge someone for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside">who they are on the inside</a>... However, a less romantic version is <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove">Abduction Is Love</a> and kidnapping is romantic!"</em> Another popular darkening of the story is, <em>"It doesn't matter what you look like, beauty is only skin-deep...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Unless you're the girl</a>."</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBoyWhoCriedWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBoyWhoCriedWolf">The Boy Who Cried Wolf</a>:
<ul><li> While the intended moral is "Don't tell lies", the structure of the story itself makes "Never tell the same lie twice" a more easily deduced moral. Also, even liars can tell the truth sometimes and you win nothing by ignoring a call for help.
</li><li> From the pragmatic point of view, the aesop of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBoyWhoCriedWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBoyWhoCriedWolf">The Boy Who Cried Wolf</a></em> is "better safe than sorry." Hell, the boy is basically the inventor of training alert!
</li><li> "Don't trust known liars—especially children—with important responsibilities, such as watching sheep."
</li><li> Another one can be seen from the villager's point of view against distrusting false alarms. After all, if you have a faulty fire alarm that keeps going off on its own, how do you actually know when there's a fire?
</li><li> Also: "A broken clock is right twice a day" in regards to false positives. From the villagers' point of view, the moment they stopped caring about the boy's cries altogether was the moment they had no security at all for the sheep.
</li><li> Combining the above interpretations: if your lookout keeps acting up, <em>fire</em> that stupid kid and get somebody competent and honest to do the job instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUglyDuckling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUglyDuckling">The Ugly Duckling</a> can be reasonably interpreted as meaning that people change over time, so how they are now doesn't tell you how they are later. It's often interpreted as about not discriminating against others based on their appearance - but this ends up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> when the duckling becomes an attractive swan in the end, with the implication that if he'd stayed ugly all the discrimination against him would have been fine. Also, cygnets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">aren't particularly ugly</a>. The duckling only thought he was ugly because he was wrong about what species he actually was. So how can this be applied to humans? "You might think you're an ugly human child now, but you could turn out to be a handsome gorilla".
<ul><li> A more useful way to look at it might be an acknowledgment that different times and cultures have different standards of beauty. A person considered ugly as sin in their native culture might be found to be drop-dead-gorgeous in another (the ancient Greeks, for example, were so big on women with <em><strong>freaking UNIBROWS</strong></em> that women would give themselves fake ones using animal hairs and wax!). In other words, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTortoiseAndTheHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTortoiseAndTheHare">The Tortoise and the Hare</a></em> is normally interpreted as, "Slow and steady wins the race," but depending on the telling, it can be taken as, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActStupidity">Don't succumb to hubris</a> when you have a clear advantage." Many examples, from American political elections to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars">Console Wars</a>, bear this moral out pretty well. In some versions, the Tortoise outright cheats - there are multiple tortoises or the tortoise rides on the hare. In these cases the moral is "Brains over Brawn".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrasshopperAndTheAnts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrasshopperAndTheAnts">The Grasshopper and the Ants</a></em>:
<ul><li> In addition to the obvious moral about <em>producing</em> for a living rather than spending all your time playing, one moral could be "If you're going to spend your time doing art, <em>get paid to do it</em>." It wouldn't have killed the grasshopper to find some paying customers for his musical performances. The Disney version, in order to create a happy ending, explicitly has the Queen Ant allow the grasshopper to stay with the ants in exchange for playing music to them. Even though he then sings about how he was wrong before, this ends up completely flipping the Aesop into two bizarre directions: if you see the grasshopper singing and playing previously as his necessary practice, it's the valid (but unusual) moral "just because something doesn't look like work to you, doesn't mean it isn't". If you see the grasshopper as just a natural musician who was just at leisure and not striving to improve at music, it's "some people, by virtue of natural talent, will just never have to do anything like work".
</li><li> This is made doubly ironic by the grasshopper's song having the lyrics "oh, the world owes us a living". After being saved by the ants, he changes it to "oh, I owe the world a living"...even though the ants now actually <em>are</em> effectively paying him his living in exchange for the song.
</li><li> In many versions of the classic fable, they have until winter to build shelter or they will freeze (or starve, interpretations vary). The ant survives and the grasshopper doesn't. The audience is supposed to conclude "Grasshopper bad, work good." It may also occur to some listeners that even with preparations, winter is terrible to live through. Your best case scenario if the grasshopper did work is 6-9 months of hard labor (rarely is the length of "winter" or "summer" specified) 3-6 months of hiding under a rock in misery, then death anyways. "Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die" takes on a whole new meaning.
</li></ul></li><li> The intended message of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bluebeard">Bluebeard</a></em> is "being curious is wrong" but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">it fails</a> when the Bluebeard's wife survives being caught and eventually is rewarded with a better husband. Many argue that "Be curious!" or "Be curious but cautious" (because the lady drops the key in the blood) would be a more appropriate moral. Other alternate interpretations are "don't marry a serial killer" and "don't give your wife/potential victim the key to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureCellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureCellar">red room.</a>"
</li><li> Everyone knows the intended lesson of the expression "The early bird gets the worm," but what does this mean from the worm's point of view? He got up early and he <em>died</em>. So much for being early. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelSilverstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelSilverstein">Shel Silverstein</a> summarized it thusly: "If you're a bird, be an early bird, but if you're a worm, sleep late."
<ul><li> "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese." We know what that's supposed to mean, but what about this maxim from the cheese's point of view? Go down fighting, and at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">take one of them down with you.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> An alternative Aesop for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePiedPiperOfHamelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePiedPiperOfHamelin">The Pied Piper of Hamelin</a></em> would be "Always ask for your money up front before doing anything." or, in the case of Hamelin, "Don't make promises you don't intend to keep".
</li><li> In "The Satyr and the Peasant", the satyr kicks the peasant out of his home for blowing hot and cold in the same breath (hot when he's trying to warm his cold hands, cold when he's trying to cool off his hot soup), therefore proving himself untrustworthy. Some people have noted the peasant's breath is obviously the same temperature both times and the satyr, not being human, has never seen a man blow on his hands or his soup before, making the lesson "The ignorant fear what they don't understand."
</li><li> The story of "Stone Soup", in which a hungry traveler comes to a village that is unwilling to share any food, but manages to get everyone to pitch in to make "stone soup", simply by putting a stone and some water in a pot. The generally accepted interpretation is that this is a story about the power of cooperation and sharing, but a more cynical interpretation may be that the traveler managed to convince the villagers to give their food in the hopes of getting something out of it, and thus managed to get a meal despite his own contribution being minimal.
</li><li> While some might use <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood">Little Red Riding Hood</a></em> as a cautionary tale about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerDanger">Stranger Danger</a> or obeying your parents, some contemporary readers might see the Aesop as, "Have discretion and be careful of the info you give" or "If you can't tell your grandma from a wolf at first glance, then you're probably too young to go out by yourself". <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vhqp');"><sup> Note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vhqp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vhqp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some earlier versions say that the wolf killed Grandma and disguised himself by wearing her (Grandma's) skin, so Red didn't notice this until she got a closer look.</span>

Since Aang's near-obsession with upholding Air Nomad values is treated as a character flaw, the intended message seems to be that "You must listen to what others have to say and compromise your ideals for the greater good." Others, however, suggest that in the context of what happened, the Aesop can be read as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution">It's sometimes easier to kill your enemies than leave them alive to face justice for their crimes</a>."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oec5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oec5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oec5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Zuko rejects a proposal to kill Ozai, but for relatively pragmatic reasons, and kicks Aang out of the meeting when Aang reacts badly to the proposal</span>
</li><li> The stated purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FriendshipIsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FriendshipIsFailure">Friendship is Failure</a> is to prove that friendship can't really solve everything.

It doesnt help that there author repeatedly tries to prove his point by just having his characters refuse to be satisfied unless things go exactly their way and will not accept any attempts to make amends over even the most minor of slights.

</li><li> The obvious moral of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> is to always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>. However, the story conveys this moral by having Po understand the meaning of the Dragon Scroll when Tai Lung couldn't: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The secret to limitless power is within oneself; the scroll isn't blank, it's reflective.</span> Tai Lung's entire life is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic">rendered pointless</a> because even if he'd been given the scroll, there was nothing in it for him to abuse, and when he loses to Po, it's not because Po is a better combatant, it's because Po is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">Instant Expert</a> who is naturally immune to his best attacks and learned an instant-death attack after seeing it performed once. Add this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a> "there are no accidents", and it boils down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a>. Fate is what determines your success, not your own effort.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em> moral is: don't run from the pain of your past, face it and grow, except Simba's tragic past never happened, it was all a lie. Until he clears his name, <em>no one</em> stands with him, not even his mother or his childhood friend-turned-lover, who specifically convinced him to return because Pride Rock <em>needed</em> him to return and take his rightful place as king. Compare this to when he first runs off: he meets Timon and Pumbaa and lives a happy (if bug-eating) life in a lush green paradise, utterly free of judgment and blame for something he didn't even do. Given that, the moral seems more like, "Once people think you did something wrong, nobody will forgive you unless you can prove someone else is at fault, so you might as well run away and start a new life".
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan">Mulan</a></em> has a rather remarkable one. The titular protagonist is obviously intended as an example for girls to follow, and the rather blatantly feminist lesson is not to let your society's expectations (in this case, concerning femininity) prevent you from doing what you do best and keep you from doing what's right. Intentionally or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop">otherwise</a>, however, another lesson it teaches is "Don't knock patriarchal society until you've walked a few miles in its shoes." Something Mulan gets to experience from being on the front lines in a war is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">what kind of horrors the men are facing</a> in hopes that their women won't have to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main message is "Be Yourself"; the main conflict of the story is caused by Ralph, the villain of an arcade game, leaving his game and entering another game where he can become a hero, only to end up letting one of the monstrous Cy-Bugs from this arcade game into a third game, where it lays eggs and quickly becomes a threat to the entire arcade. At the climax of the film, Ralph manages to save the day by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">luring all of the bestial Cy-Bugs into a bright and massive explosion</span>, using his massive fists to dislodge <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the giant Mentos used in the explosion</span>. The point of this is to show that Ralph attempting to be someone he is not caused the problem, whereas being the person he is fixed it... but he didn't <em>choose</em> to be the villain of his arcade game, the role was forced upon him. As such, the message can go from "Be Yourself" to "Don't be who you want to be, be the person everyone else wants you to be".
</li><li> An <em>Alternate</em>-alternate Aesop, and one more family-friendly to boot, might be that "sometimes the job you want isn't the one you're best suited for", and/or "even if you really hate your job, you should stick with it if it's a really <em>important</em> one".
</li><li> Another interpretation might be "be appreciative of your co-workers doing their jobs; they are people too and deserve to be treated fairly", since Ralph's problems come from the Nicelanders treating him like dirt just because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">job as the villain</a>.

<ul><li> What eventually became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ActOfValor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ActOfValor">Act of Valor</a></em> was always intended to be a recruitment video for the U.S. Navy SEALS. And yet with an outcome of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">roughly half the team becoming casualties in the film's 1- to 6-week span, including one guy losing his eye, one guy getting shot repeatedly and sustaining major injuries, and one guy dying and leaving behind a widow expecting a child,</span> the long version of the moral seems to pretty clearly be, "These guys are heroes <em>because they get horrible outcomes on a regular basis.</em>" Which is arguably pretty good for only attracting the most committed for the SEALS, but might ultimately be counterproductive for Navy recruitment as a whole.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub">The Breakfast Club</a></em>.
<ul><li> The common interpretation is that the titular teens could overcome their differences by finding common ground and appreciating the uniqueness of each of their characters. The more cynical interpretation is that the characters didn't actually learn anything: At the end of the movie, their narrative function is what you'd expect from their character types. The girl with rich parents hooks up with the bad boy, the jock gets with the loner after she gets a makeover, and the nerd is the only one who puts any actual work into the assignment. Made even worse by the message of the loner and the jock's hookup being basically "Boys will like you as long as you dress how <em>they</em> want."
</li><li> It's also easy to take away the message, 'It's ok for people from different cliques and walks of life to get along, as long as no-one else knows, and the popular members of the gang will most likely ignore everyone else again the next day, as though nothing happened.'
</li></ul></li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HonestTrailers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HonestTrailers">Honest Trailers</a></em> noted, the <em>real</em> moral of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneGirl">Gone Girl</a></em> is "Don't have sex with crazy people!" This also fits <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalAttraction">Fatal Attraction</a></em> pretty well, along with "Don't <em>commit adultery</em> with crazy people either; people will be less inclined to help you because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">you're a jerk</a>."
</li><li> A common interpretation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WomanOfTheYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WomanOfTheYear">Woman of the Year</a></em> (1942) can be summed up as "Tess is punished for being a strong woman, and is made to eat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie">Humble Pie</a> at the end so that Sam can 'win' the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfTheSexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfTheSexes">Battle of the Sexes</a>." However, a more positive reading is that Tess learns that marriage requires time and attention—more than she has been willing so far to take away from her work—and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> attempt to become purely domestic merely shows that she hasn't immediately found the proper balance (which Sam encourages her to find).
</li><li> This trope grew to absurd proportions between about 2004 and 2007, when the Iraq War became a major point of controversy worldwide. For a while, it seemed as if <em>every</em> work of fiction was interpreted as an argument either for or against the war. The final <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> prequel film (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>) was taken to be a veiled condemnation of the Bush Administration, with Darth Vader as George W. Bush and Emperor Palpatine as Dick Cheney. There have been conflicting or even parallel arguments for what, if anything, <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> was trying to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> about, ranging from the Bush and Nixon administrations to the rise of Nazism in Germany to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarringSpecialEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarringSpecialEffects">oh, hey, look at those awesome digital effects!</a> The Imperials in the original trilogy <em>do</em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">strong similarities with the Nazis</a> in their uniforms and ideology however.

</li><li> The Communist propaganda film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmCuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmCuba">I Am Cuba</a></em> villainizes capitalists (particularly Americans) with stylized sequences of frenetic jazz parties.

The film was not successful as propaganda, but it fittingly gained a following in America many decades later from critics who admired the stylish filmmaking.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Richard Brody:</strong> Aronofsky has long strained after art of a vast mythopoetic magnitude. In Mother!, he achieves itbut not at all in the way that he thinks. This morning, on Twitter, someone asked me, What was the point of the biblical references if the movie is basically about how much it sucks to be in a relationship with a male artist?, to which my response was, Exactly. In other words, mother! isnt an allegory except by directorial decree.

They may have been dumb enough to pour salt on their crops, but the world of 2505 is surprisingly open-minded to the point where racism and sexism seem to be non-existent, recognized that Joe was smart enough to solve their problems and eventually let him serve as president, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">President Camacho can be considered a competent leader who actually wants to help people</a>, his first reaction to finding Joe being getting him to find a solution to the food crisis, even if said problems are actually simple to begin with.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The obvious moral of the series is Love is more powerful than Evil. There are probably many possible alternative morals, but one easy one is: If you're putting all your security eggs in one basket (or six horcruxes), <em>keep track of those friggin' baskets</em>. Another is "Don't let your arrogance override your intelligence." This one is even mentioned in-story as Voldemort's greatest weakness; he cannot even conceive someone being as clever as him. Had he even a sliver of humility and made a horcrux out of a random rock and tossed it into a lake, he'd be unstoppable. Or, as Dumbledore pointed out in book six, he wouldn't have been Lord Voldemort.
</li><li> Yet another one is "Don't keep trying the same thing over and over after it's already failed several times." Seriously, after failing to kill Harry with Avada Kedavra <em>three times</em>, you'd think he'd have tried something else the next time!
</li><li> There's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> one with the fairy-tale, <em>The Tale of the Three Brothers</em>. The brothers come across death and he gives each of them a magical object for their cleverness. The eldest brother, Antioch, wanted an all-powerful wand (colloquially known as the Elder Wand) so he could beat a man with whom he had a quarrel. The problem is that Antioch went around talking about how he had such a powerful wand that could beat death so someone slit his throat in his sleep for it. The moral of the story is that you can't beat death with brute strength and you're supposed to accept that you're going to die one day. Ron says that he thinks the message is that if you have an all-powerful magical object that you shouldn't run around blabbing about it like an idiot. Further adding credence to this theory is that a recent master had it stolen from him for blabbing about it as well and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore had had it for about fifty years when he died, seemingly the longest holder of it and only Grindelwald (whom he beat for it) and Snape knew</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleGoldenBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleGoldenBooks">The Little Red Hen</a></em> is known for its aesop that if you want something, you have to work for it. However, you can also get the exact opposite moral from the story; the first thing that happens in the story is the little red hen coming across some wheat seeds - had the hen never found those, no bread would ever have been made. Because finding the seeds didn't require work, you can interpret it as saying that luck is needed to reach success.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SlaughterhouseFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SlaughterhouseFive">Slaughterhouse-Five</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kilgore Trout argues that the real Aesop of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> is "Make sure people don't have connections before you kill them." For example, he claims that it would have been more meaningful if God had "adopted" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> as he was dying on the cross rather than say he was God's son all along.
</li><li> Superficially, in the novel, Vonnegut seems to be saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> and that free will is an illusion. However, there are a number of subtextual clues suggesting that this isn't really what he meant. For starters, the Tralfamadorians, the biggest purveyors of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> message, are depicted as destroying the universe through negligence - not an entirely sympathetic position. There's also the way that Billy Pilgrim does <em>everything possible</em> to ensure he dies at his death. (Pilgrim himself is susceptible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> - there's a common theory that everything he sees after the war is a PTSD flashback or hallucination. See the trope page for details). Finally, there's the comment in the first chapter of the novel that writing an anti-war novel is like writing an anti-glacier novel (there will always be wars, just like there will always be glaciers) - <em>but Vonnegut wrote one anyway</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most readers interpreted the moral of <em>I Kissed Dating Goodbye</em> as "Do volunteer work as a substitute for having a significant other" instead of the intended message of "Do not forget about spirituality (including, but not limited to, serving others) simply because you wish for romantic love".
</li><li> Buzzfeed took <a class="urllink" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrismenning/what-dr-suess-books-were-really-about">a second look<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at various works by Dr. Seuss. Some of these are particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesops</a>. Considering the author, it is entirely possible that these are the intended lessons for adult readers, although most of those listed are actually the primary aesop intended for the book.Note that the books were written to work on two levels: the timeless children's morality tale and political commentary on current events (for example, Marvin K. Mooney is Nixon). It's not as surprising when you realize that the first drawings he published were anti-Nazi political cartoons starting in the late 1930s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenEggsAndHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenEggsAndHam">Green Eggs and Ham</a></em> is especially odd in the two levels it has. At first glance, it's about why it's a good idea to try new things. Unfortunately, it also has the message "no matter how often someone has told you they don't like something, keep pushing and badgering and harassing them into trying it - they'll like it and thank you in the end." Or, even more so, "freedom doesn't work" - in the sense that offering someone a free choice will often result in them taking the option that's worse for everyone, including themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLorax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLorax">The Lorax</a></em> is about the importance of nature conservancy, but the problems faced by The Once-Ler result from pure deforestation, when clear cutting and mass reforestation, i.e. planting a new Truffula tree for every tree cut down, would have prevented everything, including his company closing up and moving elsewhere. The first animated version addresses this by having the Lorax explain the trees are extremely slow growing; even if they had embraced the practice the forest would be clear cut before the replacements were more than sprouts (a real-world limitation of the practice for many kinds of tree).
<ul><li> Even in the other versions (especially the 2012 film, where Truffula trees are actually shown to grow extremely quickly), the Lorax never tries to suggest the idea of sustainable logging practices to the Once-Ler, or even point out that no more trees means no more Thneeds means no more profit. With that in mind, one could interpret them as having a secondary moral of "If you want to make a difference, offer solutions instead of just complaining". Especially considering that all versions have the Once-Ler give his visitor the last remaining Truffula seed and instruct him to replant the forest.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiddle">The Riddle</a></em> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlisonCroggon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlisonCroggon">Alison Croggon</a>, Owan tells Maerad and Cadvan a story about how the sea once loved the mountains, however the mountains slighted the sea and the sea had been angry ever since. Cadvan interpreted it to mean that you should never refuse the love of a powerful woman, but Maerad interpreted it to mean that you should never love at all because it only causes trouble.
</li><li> Are we supposed to sympathize with the androids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoAndroidsDreamOfElectricSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoAndroidsDreamOfElectricSheep">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a></em>? Reams of text have been written supporting either interpretation.
</li><li> An example so famous it's taught in US History classes is Upton Sinclair's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungle">The Jungle</a></em>. Sinclair was trying to convert Americans to socialism with a story about the horrors of capitalism made manifest in meat processing plants. Unfortunately for his intended message, all anyone noticed was the description of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">sickeningly unsanitary</a> the meat processing plants were, leading less to "Oh, the poor oppressed workers!" and more to "Oh, the poor oppressed workers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">are in my food!</a></em>" which led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. Sinclair put it best when he said "I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach."
</li><li> The message of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePoisonwoodBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePoisonwoodBible">The Poisonwood Bible</a></em> is ostensibly that colonialism is bad. However since the book focuses on an American family of Baptist missionaries in the Congo in the 1950s rather than Europeans or Africans at colonialisms peak half a century earlier, it can be seen as more anti-fundamentalism rather than anti-colonialism. Nathan, the patriarch of the family, doesnt become a crazy hobo who dies for his cause because of colonialism, he becomes a crazy hobo because he refuses to sway from his literal interpretation of the Bible.
</li><li> Some people became vegans after reading <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em>, despite the story being about the morality of British imperialism. The book also makes the point that the Martians treat us the same way we treat animals. Wells, a vegetarian, would likely state that this aesop is a perfectly valid, if secondary, lesson to take from the story. It also showed how having an outside force roll over you would be like at a time when the British Empire was at its height.
</li><li> The stated aesop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lysistrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lysistrata">Lysistrata</a></em> might be interpreted as stating that if Athens and Sparta teamed up instead of fighting each other, they would be unstoppable and have the rest of Greece at their mercy. In modern times, the play is generally considered to have a pacifist and/or feminist message. These are justified in so far as the play <em>does</em> portray the war as hurting both sides and acknowledges (albeit in a humorous way) that war has a toll on female civilians. However, given the Ancient Greek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">opinions of women</a>, it seems that his message was more like "even women are smart enough to know this war is bad."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fahrenheit451" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit 451</a></em> is almost universally interpreted to be about government censorship on literature being used to control the population. As late as the 1980s, Bradbury himself stated that the book is about censorship. In his old age, however, Bradbury came out insisting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">he'd always intended</a> the book to be about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.laweekly.com/2007-05-31/news/ray-bradbury-fahrenheit-451-misinterpreted/">how crappy television is.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Critics have wisely chosen to ignore Bradbury's assertions, and a UCLA class drove him from the room by telling him to his face that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">he was simply wrong about his own book</a>.
</li><li> <em>Anna's Story</em> was a sympathetic account of Australian schoolgirl Anna Wood's death by water intoxication after taking ecstasy. Obviously, the intended aesop was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">Drugs Are Bad</a>. However, since Anna's friends waffled for way too long about getting her medical attention after it became very obvious that she was deteriorating, the equally important lesson learned could be that if you're going to take drugs with friends, <em>have decent friends</em>. Alternatively (and a bit more generously to Anna's friends, who were mostly guilty of little more than naivete and inexperience), if you're going to take drugs, make sure you and the people you're with know what the potential consequences are and what the best course of action to take in case of something going wrong is.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a>'s intention behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> was to denounce the government of the Soviet Union under Stalin, and a general denouncement of totalitarianism (not to be confused with authoritarianism). Most of the people who read it, however, come out believing it's about the horrors of censorship, dictatorship, propaganda, and anything that isn't democracy and libertarianism. Bonus points for quoting "absolute power corrupts, absolutely." (Orwell despised it when people resorted to using other people's words to make a point, or using one-word stock responses.) Orwell himself was a dedicated democratic socialist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarrietTheSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarrietTheSpy">Harriet the Spy</a></em> includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">Hard Truth Aesop</a> "Sometimes you have to lie to people to help them feel better about themselves so they won't hate you" via the likely unintentional Aesop "The things you write in your personal journal should not be an honest representation of your thoughts because someone reading it without permission might be offended."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> features one of these. As Clancy is a political conservative, he intended the story to be about the dangers of environmental extremists. Unfortunately in order to make them a credible threat, he had to have ecoterrorists in charge of a huge megacorporation. The novel can instead be taken as a tract against unchecked corporate power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em>: The Novel spends a lot of time musing about Divine Retribution and An Eye For An Eye and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a>. More cynical readers point out that the moral is "If you are going to screw someone over, make damn sure that you kill him afterward"
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColdEquations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColdEquations">The Cold Equations</a>," the intended aesop is that sometimes there isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">a third option</a> and even the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Science Hero</a> sometimes has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a> and take the lesser evil.

Vathi notes that every culture has exactly one traditional story of a woman who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">excelled in a traditionally male occupation,</a> with the official moral being that "women can do these things too." However, her own cynical take on it is that they exist to show that women can do these things too <em>if they are truly exceptional,</em> with the implication being that any girl (like herself) who doesn't want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> is arrogantly claiming to be one in a million.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast">Venus and Mars</a></em> self-help books, there was a parable about a knight who rescued a princess from a dragon and married her, only for her to be attacked again. This time, she advised him on how to rescue her, instead of letting him figure it out for himself. He feels bad at the celebratory feast because he feels like he didn't <em>really</em> do anything to earn it. Then the same thing happens, and he feels even more depressed. Finally, he hears the familiar screams of a princess being attacked by a dragon, only it's not his wife, it's another princess in another castle. He rescues <em>this</em> princess, sends a message to his wife to tell her it's over, and lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a> with this new princess who <em>doesn't</em> tell him what to do. What the reader was <em>supposed</em> to take from this was that it's important for a man to be able to solve his own problems without any outside help, and feel like a hero. What it ended up implying was that it's important for a woman to be passive and delicate so as not to hurt her boyfriend or husband's ego, or that if her partner cheats, it's <em>her</em> fault for being too outspoken and/or not passive enough. It also implies that a woman, no matter how knowledgeable about how to "slay the dragon" she may be, needs a man to solve all her problems for her.

The author himself has said that an equally valid aesop is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> and "the price of victory is often high and occasionally horrific."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAGeisha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAGeisha">Memoirs of a Geisha</a></em>, Hatsumomo's story could be an interpretation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImBeautiful">Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!</a> is not going to work in the long run. Hatsumomo treats everyone horribly because of her status and never once considered the consequences of alienating everyone around her. But when she starts to age and another younger and prettier geisha comes along, no one has any reason to put up with Hatsumomo. Even Hatsumomo's plan to have her pupil Pumpkin inherit the okiya failed as Mrs Nitta would rather adopt Sayuri, purely so she wouldn't have to put up with Hatsumoto (who would only use Pumpkin as her puppet).

In prison, "not taking disrespect" is a survival mechanism, but it can get you into lots of trouble on the outside.

<ul><li> The Christmas carol "I'll Be Home For Christmas" was originally written by 16-year-old Buck Ram and is about a homesick college student, but has more recently become associated with soldiers away at Christmastime. At least one version of the song even includes soldiers wishing their families a Merry Christmas during the bridge. Touching, yes, but not the original intended message. Adding to the misconception is how the song tends to be associated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> era (as do so many popular Christmas songs), so many listeners assume that the narrator is an American soldier in Europe or the Pacific.

Upon his return, he finds that two of them have invested the money and earned an appreciable return; he lets them keep some of it and rewards them with more talents to invest. One, however, who received the smallest amount, simply buried it and returns it to his master, which gets him fired. It is interpreted in various ways, usually to implore Christians to use their abilities to serve God and bring more to salvation, for which they will eventually be rewarded. <br/><br/>However, liberation theologians have pointed out that the "lazy" servant may be the one who really has the point Jesus was making. The master did not specifically direct his servants to invest the money he left them; they took that decision themselves. Yet upon his return, the master claimed most of the money they made for <em>himself</em>, made from a decision he took no part in, his claim on the return being solely that he is the master — thus exploiting the servants' labor for his personal gain. The servant who simply kept the money and returned it to his master upon the master's return was aware of this, and by doing so called the master out through his refusal to take part.
</li><li> The Biblical story of Onan was pretty clearly intended to underscore the importance of levirate marriage, a practice by which, if a married man died childless, his brother would marry his widow and the first child of that marriage would be considered the dead guy's child. In fact, Onan's reason for spilling his seed is explicitly stated to be that the child wouldn't legally be his. However, since levirate marriage has effectively been discontinued indefinitely even among the Jews, some have reinterpreted the story to be about forbidding masturbation or contraception (especially the withdrawal method).
</li><li> Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Issac in Genesis 22 has been interpreted in various ways. Most interpretations from Jewish exegesis focus on Abraham's utter faith in God's commandment and hold up his willingness to make the sacrifice as a virtue. Traditionally, Christians interpret the entire passage as a foreshadowing of Our Lord &amp; Savior' crucifixion. A minority interpretation, however, is that Abraham failed the test, abandoning God's previous commandments against killing in Genesis 9. Seeing this, begins the chain of events that would lead to the establishment of the Mosaic covenant and Jewish law.
</li><li> An infamous biblical example is the Book of Job, in which God is challenged by Satan to prove that Job, a good man, would still have faith in God if he was not blessed with a good life. While it is often cited to prove the importance of retaining faith in God even through dire circumstances, it is easily interpreted to mean "don't trust God because he'll sell you out to Satan to prove a point". (Also, God actually appears before Job in Job 38, arguably rendering faith moot.)

Some feel that how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chara steals your soul at the end of a Genocide run and how the only way to fix it is to delete your save file</span> gives off the moral, "The only way to move forward is to burn your bridges."
</li><li> People have also said the meaning is either the same or the complete opposite of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable">The Stanley Parable</a></em>that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only meaningful choice you can make in a video game is to turn it off and walk away forever. <em>Undertale</em> puts huge emphasis on actions having consequences, but it also points out that it's not meant to have infinite replay value. It doesn't help that the message you receive at the end of the pacifist route rather explicitly aims towards the middle ground of these two - don't stop until you make it to the ending that's happiest for everybody, and <em>then</em> stop playing forever.</span>
</li><li> Some of the routes in the game, between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">pacifist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Genocide</a>, have a bit of a brush with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a>: "If you have the power to rewind time, you have no excuse not to do the very absolute best."

</li><li> One of the major aspects of the game requires learning about the lives of the bosses who gain thorough character development. The point here is to humanize the monsters you fight and make the player realize that they have loved ones, lives, hobbies, and everyday interactions like anyone else. However, the bosses attack you first, and the option of fleeing combat is often not an option <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except for one boss in particular who you have to flee multiple times</span>, so you're placed into a situation where the game expects you to befriend the people who have tried to murder you and to spare their lives. It ties in with the Great Responsibility point made above with a sprinkle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Turn the Other Cheek</a> which can either be heartwarming or frustrating depending on how you view the lesson which can be summed up as "You have to be the bigger person no matter what others do to you". That said, the best possible ending requires you sparing every boss and enemy regardless of the encounter, so the game is certainly implying it's your duty to let everything they do slide, but berates the player for not expecting the game narrative to do the same back.

The Darcsen are openly hated as a race because of the Darcsen Calamity, and we're told over and over that it's wrong to hate the Darcsen of today just because of something that happened so long ago. Then we find out that it wasn't the Darcsen who did it, it was the Valkyrur, and the Darcsen race is exonerated while the blame is laid at the feet of the Valkyrur where it should have been all along. And this attitude drives Alicia further down into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism">Internalized Categorism</a> as people begin to fear her potential for destruction, and ultimately resolves never to show her Valkyria status again.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Aesop and Son</em> shorts on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> show had Aesop telling his son a fable with a moral, followed by his son proposing an alternate moral (which was inevitably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">pun</a>).
</li><li> Being a show filled with Aesops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is rife with this. A few examples:
<ul><li> "Swarm of the Century" has the Aesop that you should listen to your friends, even when they seem not to make sense<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5432j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5432j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5432j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Pinkie Pie is the only pony who knows how to drive the parasprites out of town, but no one else will listen to her</span>, but most of the fanbase agrees that the message the episode actually demonstrated was "If you know the solution to a problem <em>take the time to explain it rather than just expecting everyone to listen to you for no reason</em>."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6p3vl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6p3vl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6p3vl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <em>reason</em> they don't listen to Pinkie is because she never actually bothers to tell them what the solution is and without the explanation, her actions (gathering musical instruments) looks like a tremendous waste of time.</span>
</li><li> "Suited For Success" has had a large portion of the fanbase interpreting the episode as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> saying "let the real artist work on the design and don't interfere."
</li><li> The infamous "Feeling Pinkie Keen" has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostAesop">ostensible</a> moral of "just because you don't understand something doesn't make it untrue". Most of the fanbase either interpreted the episode as saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">Science Is Bad</a>", or more charitably, "The purpose of science is to find the truth, not to prove your preconceived notions correct."
</li><li> "Lesson Zero"'s stated Aesop was "Don't belittle your friends' concerns". The much more obvious Aesop is "Keep a level head and don't let minor issues force you to use extreme solutions". In a broader sense, it could be read as "No one is perfect, and it's okay to fail sometimes. It's better to accept failure gracefully than to abuse others to succeed." In addition, there's the part where Twilight announces that if she can't find a friendship problem to solve, then she'll just have to make one. You could say another moral of the story is "Doing the right thing doesn't mean you go looking for trouble."
</li><li> "Hurricane Fluttershy"'s moral is ostensibly "even if you don't feel you can make a difference, you can", but one can also get "School bullying is <em>NOT</em> harmless and can screw you up for life" out of it.
</li><li> "A Canterlot Wedding"'s moral, to trust your instincts, glosses over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">the mistakes that made things as bad as they got</a> (Twilight's instinct that Cadance was evil was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Right for the Wrong Reasons</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">made her discredit herself</a>, while everyone else's instinct to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">trust "Cadance" over Twilight was horribly wrong</a>). Fans instead viewed the moral as "you need to be tactful and have evidence even if you're right, but a claim without tact or evidence should still be heard out as it might have some truth".
</li><li> "One Bad Apple" <em>tries</em> to deliver the aesop "if you're bullied tell an adult", but almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">immediately fails</a> by having Applejack witness some bullying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">and do nothing other than frown</a> while Babs Seed has to stand up for the CMC to make the bullies back down. This makes the aesop seem like "get a toughguy to defend you if you're bullied" instead (if "stand up to bullies" wasn't secretly the intended message all along but just too family-unfriendly to say directly).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E13MagicalMysteryCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E13MagicalMysteryCure">"Magical Mystery Cure"</a> has "A True, True Friend" deliver the intended Aesop about helping friends find their true selves in musical. But the confusing/contradictory nature of the cutie marks/destinies swap caused many to see it as "don't blindly follow perceived destiny, especially if you're bad at it/it makes you and others miserable" and/or "you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and be who you choose/want to be" despite more-or-less contradicting the happenings of the episode.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11nef');"><sup>explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11nef" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11nef');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They were incapable of doing their "incorrect" destinies/cutie marks which wouldn't be the case if it truly was up to choice. And Twilight's destiny to become an alicorn princess is accepted despite her having no choice or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">personal want</a>.</span>
</li><li> The aesops of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E23InspirationManifestation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E23InspirationManifestation">"Inspiration Manifestation"</a> are "you need to tell your friends the truth rather than blindly praise them" and "constant praise actually can stifle your artistic integrity and it's all right to take some criticism now and then." It accidentally added in the aesop of "your usual artistic style isn't always what the customer needs" for people in creative industries, told through Rarity having trouble building what a puppeteer wants because she adds her nouveau-riche flair to a puppet show booth. A similar accidental aesop with Rarity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E14SuitedForSuccess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E14SuitedForSuccess">"Suited for Success"</a> was "you can't just assume the artist/contractor knows exactly what you want" after the Mane Six sans Rarity make very unrealistic demands about what they want for their clothes, including Rainbow Dash's now-memetic line "it needs to be about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyPercentMoreAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyPercentMoreAwesome">twenty percent cooler</a>".
</li><li> In "Princess Spike" the titular character is shown using his connection to Twilight to make himself feel important and by abusing the authority to enjoy indulgent perks, and the episode tries to teach that this is wrong by having things result in a chain reaction that ruins a major diplomatic event. However, since the <em>only</em> things that cause any problems are the events Spike arranged on specific orders not to let anything disturb her rest, while the abuse of his authority causes no problems whatsoever, the illustrated morals become "don't attempt a job you're not qualified to do", "don't <em>give</em> a job to someone who isn't qualified", and "enjoy the perks your job provides" (though admittedly these are actually decent lessons to teach as well).
</li><li> The moral of "School Daze" could just as easily be "it's not what you know, but <em>who</em> you know", as it's very evident that the only reason Twilight Sparkle is able to get her school off the ground in the first place, let alone after failing to get accredited, is because of her relationship to Princess Celestia rather than having the knowledge and experience necessary to run a school. It could also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">Screw the Rules, I Make Them!</a> considering Twilight Sparkle's own authority as well.
</li><li> The episode "The Cart Before the Ponies" delivers the moral "Adults aren't always right". Considering specifically how the adult characters in this episode managed to screw things up, it could just as easily be interpreted that there was another moral <em>for</em> the adults in the audience - "Don't try to live vicariously through your children".
</li></ul></li><li> In early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends">My Little Pony 'n Friends</a></em>, the episode "The Fugitive Flowers" has a standard "don't judge a book by its cover" aesop that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">rather bungled</a> because the main reason that the ponies don't trust the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab">Crabnasties</a> is because they're <em>wrecking everything in sight</em>, not because they're ugly. The aesop, in this case, is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>: the mistrust and problems could have been avoided if the Crabnasties were more willing to explain things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Homer's Enemy" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">was meant to show how a normal person would not be able to survive in that universe</a>. But Frank Grimes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventual death</span> came about from his own obsessive hostility towards Homer. Homer's attempts at making it up to Grimes after getting him in trouble only fuel the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> in Grimes, which lead to him concocting a scheme to humiliate the former in front of everyone. He finally snaps when his own attempt at spiting someone he doesn't like, itself a rather childish act, doesn't go as planned. This spawns <em>its own</em> alternate aesop interpretation; "never try to expose the rules of an insane system that rewards stupidity and punishes the wrong people. It won't work, you'll just go crazy, and everyone will focus on your craziness and not the point you were trying to make in the first place. If you have the misfortune to be born in an insane universe, your best bet is to never struggle or strive for anything in your life, since you'll only be disliked for it; conversely, if you behave in a lazy and foolish fashion, everyone will like you better." Compounding this was Grimes' frustration that, from his perspective, Homer was living an idyllic life without putting in an ounce of effort, but he based this presumption on a single evening (without realizing that Homer had been hyper-focused on making a good impression), as the Simpson household is <em>not</em> normally like that, nor do they have lobster for dinner on a routine basis.
</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em> episode tackles The Boy Who Cried Wolf, with Orson telling the tale to illustrate why being known as a liar is bad and explain why he's ignoring Roy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap">only to have an epiphany and re-interpret the Aesop as "Even liars sometimes tell the truth"</a>. You can punish someone for lying, but no one gains anything by ignoring a cry for help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DreamComeTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DreamComeTrue">Dream Come True</a></em> (<em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayWazJ_y2vo">A Mule Mom's Story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)</em> is a short animation made to showcase "Mule Moms" (female mules fertilized In Vitro to both boost breeding efforts and give the infertile mules a chance to be mothers) and the Gypsy Vanner breed of horses. The <em>intended</em> lesson is to never give up on your dreams, but the one that gets across is, "If you have no friends, get pregnant with the resident popular guy's kid and everyone will love you." This is because of a combination of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">All of the Other Reindeer</a> plot and a main character who does <em>absolutely nothing</em> aside from get pregnant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em> attempted to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about female empowerment in the episode "Power Girl Surfers", where Reggie starts an all-girl surfing group to show the world that girls can excel at extreme sports. She decides to do this after Otto is unexpectedly offered a cover story in his favorite surfing magazine, and she's unable to convince the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerk</a> magazine editor that she deserves it more than he does; at the end, she even crashes Otto's photo-shoot with her friends to challenge him to a surf contest, humiliating him in front of the people offering him a shot at fame. Because of Reggie's actions, the message unfortunately comes across as being less about female empowerment than about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealousy</a>, and punishing other people for their undeserved good fortune.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Parodied using an in-universe example. Kaeloo spends a whole episode teaching Stumpy and Quack Quack how difficult the life of a parent is in an attempt to get them to respect their parents more and be grateful for all their hard work. When she asks what they learned from the whole thing, Stumpy responds that he learned that you shouldn't have kids.
</li><li> In-universe example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> where the Manhattan clan discusses what lessons could be learned from Lexington and Goliath's encounter with the Pack. Lexington at first declares they should never trust anyone else but Goliath counters that some endeavors requires taking some risks because never leaving the comforts of their confines will leave them (in Goliath's words) "forever alone". Brooklyn and Broadway add to the discussion that they shouldn't give too <em>much</em> trust to people they've just met.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> had the moral of "You can't please everyone". The episode featured TJ realising that a kid on the playground (Gordy) didn't like him. He proceeded to absolutely suck up to Gordy and after a series of misadventures, Gordy still says he just doesn't like TJ. While "You can't please everyone" is a good message, Gordy has several reasons to dislike TJ by that point (TJ got him in trouble, TJ accidentally almost poisoned him with walnuts, TJ utterly sucked up to him and chased him down to find out why Gordy didn't like him) and they can't give any reason for disliking one another. This could easily be a great aesop in which Gordy could mention that TJ's behaviour is why he doesn't like TJ, or that things TJ and his friends consider virtues are seen as annoying or overbearing to someone else.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "The Snuke." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Cartman</a> immediately assumes that the new Muslim kid in school is a terrorist; his attempts to investigate him result in him and Kyle discovering an actual, unrelated terrorist plot being carried out by some Russians <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on behalf of England</span>. The episode ends with Kyle saying that Cartman was wrong to suspect the Muslim kid just because of his ethnicity, but Cartman notes that they wouldn't have discovered the actual plot if he hadn't, meaning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">racism and bigotry saved America</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Plastered to a school wall facing a busy street in Vienna, Austria, there are <a class="urllink" href="http://www.stadtbekannt.at/de/wien/leben/don_t-try-to-be-an-apple-if-you-are-a-banana_-you_ll-always-be-a-second-rate-apple_.html">meter-high letters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> proclaiming: "Don't try to be an apple if you are a banana. You will always be a second-rate apple." According to the artist it's intended to be some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a> message, but if you ask the kids going to school there, most are disturbed by the apparent message of "don't even bother trying to change/to rise above your social standing" or "if you're not naturally gifted at something, you shouldn't even bother to try it."
</li><li> A well-known anecdote told on the subject of tax cuts refers to a number of men who go to dine at a restaurant together, dividing the cost between themselves based on how wealthy each is. When the price of the meal is reduced, the wealthiest get the largest discount; the less wealthy men then either assault or kill (depending on the telling) the wealthier men, only to find they alone can no longer afford the meal. The intended meaning is to explain the arithmetic resulting in higher cuts for the rich: the unintended meaning is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/TabletopGames">after you kill someone</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouDieICallYourStuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouDieICallYourStuff">take their stuff.</a>
</li><li> Actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JewelStaite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JewelStaite">Jewel Staite</a> experienced this after she <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/JewelStaite/status/868621968320245760">tweeted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a well-intentioned but very ill-timed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a> message: "Not everyone is going to like you, but you're fine just the way you are. Don't change for people. Find your tribe and stick with them.😘" Many people replied that her advice translated to "Never try to improve yourself in any way," or "Rather than try to widen your horizons, just live in a bubble with people whose opinions are exactly like yours." The "find your tribe and stick with them" part came off as especially tone-deaf since the tweet was posted <em>one day</em> after a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/27/530351468/2-dead-1-injured-after-stabbing-in-portland-ore">white supremacist's attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, leading <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/jchaager/status/868657691672969218">one person<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to claim that she was encouraging white supremacists to keep being white supremacists.
</li><li> The real-life story of Rudy Ruettiger, and the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rudy">Rudy</a></em>, is generally invoked to show that it is possible to pursue even an unlikely dream and succeed by working hard enough. But although Rudy was the only Notre Dame player to be carried off the field for years, he didn't eventually become a gridiron player; the film gives no details of his future but in real life he became a motivational speaker purely based on the Aesop properties of his story. This means that looking at the longer picture, all of his work was done just to make one sack and never play again, and then essentially be bailed out (into motivational speaking) by people who wanted his story to be seen as inspiring. The long term moral of the story becomes the exact opposite; as above, "don't try to be a second-rate apple".
