<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana">La-Mulana</a></em>:
<ul><li> The mantras. Essentially, after finding a certain set of items you have to find a tablet that tells you the mantra, then find the correct rear-side room to chant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(type)</span> the mantra. Finding the tablets and the items required isn't terribly hard, but figuring out the correct room is. To find the correct room to chant the mantra, you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find a glowing compass on the wall in the front-side room, traverse the path from the compass to the boss room, then go to the rear-side, find the compass there, then traverse the same path, and finally chant the mantra in the room you are led to</span>. Alternately, save yourself two hours and your sanity and just look up the rooms on the internet.
</li><li> There's also the lantern puzzle in the second level of the Endless Corridor. You're required to light the lanterns that correspond to the end year of the Aztec Fifth Age (2012). However, the lanterns are labeled with the various glyphs that represent numbers. Remember those little symbols that show up near ladders to new areas? Those are the numerical glyphs, and that's the best clue you're gonna get. Thought they were eye candy? You're wrong. Just to add to the frustration, the game is incredibly picky about the correct solution, and will sometimes flat-out refuse to acknowledge that you've solved the puzzle.
</li><li> There's a similar puzzle to the Endless corridor puzzle one in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine">Tower of Ruin</a>, specifically in the remake. You're given 6 glyphs instead of 10, and you only need to enter two of them. In the original, they're English letters, but in the remake, they're glyphs that correspond to letters (which never show up even as background decoration, unlike the letters). It's easy enough to figure out that you're meant to type <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mu</span> thanks to a pair of signs talking about a 'Nameless one' elsewhere in the ruins, but good luck figuring out how you spell it with the glyphs. What you're meant to do is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">go to the sign that says the name you're meant to type, take note of where the name is on the sign, unequip the glyph reader (which is something that's required to read every sign in the game and is generally unwise to unequip) and take note of the glyphs that correspond to m and u, then enter those glyphs, unlocking a chest.</span> You're much more likely to find the solution through trial-and-error, or if you played the original game, which has the same solution. It's one of the only situations where the remake made the puzzle harder.
</li><li> The platform puzzle for the Life Jewel in the Dimensional Corridor. First off, you have to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Lamp of Time</a> to freeze time and stop a block in midair at a very specific point. Then, you have to jump down a spike-lined shaft, land the jump, and get off the block before the Lamp expires. Then, you have to pull off a very tricky series of jumps, where one misstep will send you into a spike. It gets worse: every time you fuck up (and you <em>will</em> fuck up), you have to wait three minutes for the Lamp of Time to recharge. That's three minutes in-game; you can't boot up any of the minigames or listen to the jukebox. If you kill the miniboss in the room below, then it becomes almost impossible to reach the Life Jewel room. And you can't leave the room until you either kill the miniboss or die.
</li><li> The Room of Gems and Scales, the puzzle for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Mace</a>. You have to balance a number of gems on a large scale. The game does tell you the weight of each gem... on two different tablets hidden throughout the ruins. But that's not all it tells you. You have to figure out Lemeza's weight, which is done by finding a scale in the Mausoleum of the Giants, pulling off a tricky jump to get to it, and figure out his weight from the numerical glyphs the scale shows. Even worse, one side of the scale weighs slightly more than the other, and this is never mentioned anywhere. And it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">gone</a> if you mess it up and don't have a save to reload to.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">remake</a> tweaks all these puzzles slightly, making them easier (or at least more fair) with the possible exception of Endless Corridor. The map now shows compass locations, so finding the right locations is easier - and chanting the mantras takes a single button press, so finding them through trial-and-error is less tedious. The platform puzzle for the Life Jewel no longer requires the Lamp of Time; <em>getting</em> to it does, however, now that the Dragon no longer has a platform on his back (you have to stop time when he fires a water column and swim up through it to the platform; altogether, the timing is much more forgiving). Also, the Room of Gems and Scales starts with <em>balanced</em> scales (and Lemeza's weight has been adjusted to compensate). The Endless Corridor puzzle now requires you to pass through only 4 lanterns in the correct general sequence. The clue still requires knowledge of La-Mulanese numbers, but Mulbruk may glitch out and not give you a hint on the last two numbers. You also don't need to pass by <em>all</em> the lanterns, but many players make this assumption and give themselves further headache doing so. Ironic, since the order of the other incorrect lanterns is ignored in favor of the correct order of the 4 required lanterns.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana2">La-Mulana 2</a></em>, while a little more forgiving than the first game, is no slouch in this department either. A standout is the puzzle required to access the Ancient Cog. While opening the chest isn't particularly difficult, getting to the chest definitely is this. Throughout the game, there are tablets hinting about an Infernal Fiend biting into the neck of a Colossal Dragon, with one even giving you a mantra combination to use at the dragon's neck, but with no indication of where the dragon or the fiend actually are. While the save tablet in Heaven's Labyrinth (where the cog is located) makes reference to the Infernal Fiend, almost nothing is said about the Colossal Dragon. The solution? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You need to work out that the Infernal Fiend that the area references is the weird blob-like creature that appears on all of the tablets in the area, <em>and</em> that the shape of that creature roughly corresponds with the shape of the area, with the mouth the Fiend being the room where the Ancient Cog is, <em>and</em> remember that the image appearing on Takamagahara Shrine's tablets is a dragon, and realise that that's the Colossal Dragon it's making reference too, and use the mantra on the room corresponding to the dragon's neck, which opens a path that drops down to the Ancient Cog chest in Heaven's Labyrinth. Luckily, there is a secondary hint for the location where the mantras are needed: a tablet in that room is written by the Olympians (who live in Heaven's Labyrinth) simply states "Where is this?". Most players end up solving this puzzle through trial and error on this tablet rather than through the intended method</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheBeast">Shadow of the Beast</a> 3</em> has the slab puzzle in Caves of Bidhur; every other puzzle can be solved consistently, but this essentially involves approximating a physics puzzle in a game without physics. You have to get a large slab across a long (but shallow) pit by placing (and moving them as you shift the slab along) three balls in said pit correctly so they evenly balance the slab; one mistake and it falls in the pit and you have to go back to the last checkpoint. In itself this would only be kind of irritating, but the last checkpoint is at least a few minutes back and requires you to enter a cave full of respawning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Bats</a> that you need to kill a certain amount of to get the hammer you need to do the slab puzzle, so you end up getting drained each time you screw up. Finally, there's a boss fight straight after solving the puzzle; while not too difficult it's another way to get sent back if you mess up and die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTropics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTropics">StarTropics</a></em> has an infamous puzzle that is not that difficult, but left players confused since it breaks the fourth wall. Attached to the game's instruction booklet is a letter from the main character's Uncle; you learn late in the game that your Uncle has a transceiver in his shoe. You must enter a three digit combination to track the transceiver. Your only clue is "dip my note in water." If you dip the letter attached to the manual in water, invisible ink appears to tell you the combination. It's a simple puzzle, since the game outright tells you what to do, but even people who owned the manual and had the letter were confused, since actually dipping the physical letter in water makes no freakin' sense and many assumed the letter in question was an in-game item. Nintendo got so many questions about it that they published the solution in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The code is 747</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Superman64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Superman64">Superman 64</a></em> is a very puzzle-oriented game. Many of the puzzles are simple, but there is a puzzle in the final level of the game that is maddeningly hard. Brainiac sends you to a room with several portals (Word of God is that it's a time machine) with a number in the center of the screen. Players must go through portals until the number in the center of the screen equals 2000, causing Brainiac's computers to go haywire. The puzzle itself is self explanatory, but immeasurably difficult because this portion of the level is heavily glitched so that the player dies <em>at complete random</em>- <em>(even if you're using a Gameshark and have infinite health).</em> The glitches make the final puzzle nearly un-solvable. One of the many reasons why this game is considered among the worst in the history of video games isn't just because of the convoluted gameplay and rushed release but this very puzzle screwed up an already bad enough game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> The infamous block-and-backtracking puzzle in the Ice Palace of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>: you need to find a way to keep a switch held down so that you can advance, but there's no objects in the room you can use to do that. The solution is to push one of the blocks upstairs into a hole and then use that to hold down the switch. The reason this is hard to figure out is because this is the only time you're required to use a movable block to hold down a switch and said movable blocks can only be moved for a single tile by default, as opposed to a statue that always stand out and can be moved around freely. There's also the fact that none of the other puzzles in the game require you to move puzzle elements between floors, and any other time you can throw or push something into a hole that isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pit</a> and jump after it, it's guaranteed to disappear by the time you reach the bottom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or you could just do some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> and use the Cane of Somaria, which generates blocks for you.</span> Even if you do figure it out, half of the room the blocks are in is blocked by colored pillars which you might need to lower to access the right block, making for annoying backtracking. The puzzle was made easier for the GBA port.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>: The Sacred Grove's Master Sword puzzle. Guiding the statues back to their positions in order to be granted access to the Master Sword is often called one of the hardest puzzles in the game and the series. Even worse, you can inadvertently get yourself crushed by them if you both end up on the same pillar, or stuck, sandwiched in a corner by one of the golems, meaning you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">reset the puzzle</a> for another attempt.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a></em> is infamous for the bomb defusing puzzle on the Mars Colony. It consists of Agent 5 disarming a bomb before removing it from the base's core before it explodes. The puzzle requires guessing a combination of three nodes (red, yellow and green) in the correct order. Level 2 adds a blue node for a total of four, and Level 3 adds a purple node for a total of five. What makes this puzzle so difficult is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">there is no strategy involved, and looking up a guide won't help</a>. The combination is random every time you enter a level, and all the help you get after entering a combination guess is how many nodes are in the correct places. The game doesn't tell you <em>which</em> nodes are correct, just how many are correct, and that's all. This isn't so bad on Level 1, since you get enough chances that guessing every possible combination of red-yellow-green will eventually produce the combination. But Level 2 and Level 3 could potentially end without you guessing a single correct node before you run out of chances. And if you fail at any level, you go back to Level 1. All of this would be frustrating enough, but on top of all of that, there's a ten-minute time limit, and every node guess eats a few seconds away. Failing to clear the puzzle in time means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">Agent 5 dies of radiation poisoning</a>. The <em>Pegasus Prime</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a> alleviated the difficulty somewhat by making selecting nodes take less time, but it's still an exercise in frustration, and a pure guessing game.

To do this, Gabriel must distract Moseley with a piece of candy and swipe his passport from his pocket, steal his hat and jacket, draw a mustache on the face of the passport photo with a marker to hide the face, and then construct a fake mustache by putting some masking tape on a small hole and chasing the cat past that hole, leaving some of its fur on the tape, and then using the fur to create a fake mustache by gluing it to Gabriel's face with a packet of syrup. As <a class="urllink" href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/78.html">Old Man Murray<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> put it:
<div class="indent">"Maybe Jane Jensen was too busy reading difficult books by Pär Lagerkvist to catch what stupid Quake players learned from watching the A-Team: The first step in making a costume to fool people into thinking you're a man without a mustache, is <strong>not to construct a fake mustache</strong>."
</div><ul><li> According to the programmers in a Game Informer interview, <em>nobody</em> at Sierra liked that puzzle. However, Roberta Williams had left the project by then without telling anyone what she'd <em>planned</em> for that sequence, and this was the first replacement puzzle anyone could think of. Under time and budget pressure, they had to go with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Another literal puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TexMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TexMurphy">Under a Killing Moon</a></em>, where a note has been torn into tiny pieces. The pieces have to be reassembled, and Tex will not be able to read it until each one is in exactly the right place- a single pixel off, and it's illegible as far as he's concerned. To top it off, the pieces don't snap into place or give any other hint that they've been correctly aligned. The end result is that it's easy to have a puzzle that looks completed but isn't recognized as so by the game, forcing the player to randomly move pieces around one pixel at a time to trigger the next cutscene.
</li><li> Then there's the 'cubes in the vault' puzzle in Infocom's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter">Spellbreaker</a></em>. (A variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveCoinsPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveCoinsPuzzle">Twelve Coins Puzzle</a>) There are a dozen or so magical cubes, but only <em>one</em> is the true cube you need. In order to determine the actual cube, you'll need to resort them a number of times, and cast the 'detect magic' spell. Problem is, you can only do this three times before being caught by security — and if you haven't truly narrowed it down to one cube, it will use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun">Schrödinger's Gun</a> to move it away from the one you pick to another one that fits all clues so far — <strong>and</strong> you're not allowed to save the game while in the vault (to prevent solving the puzzle with trial and error, and hide the fact that it's cheating).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullThrottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullThrottle">Full Throttle</a></em> features a puzzle late in the game where the player has to find a secret passageway to Malcom Corley's office in an alley behind Corley Motors' headquarters. As a hint, Maureen mentions that she used the passageway to get into the office by lining her eyes up with a crack on the wall, then kicking the wall at that spot when a nearby set of switches were all green. Also, she was six years old at the time. This had many players stumped, because the spot itself was already difficult to find, but the timing had to be precise as well, so it wasn't easy to tell whether they had the wrong spot or their timing was off. (The spot made a different sound when thumped- not that it helps if you think you've got the right spot with the wrong timing.)

One of the items required is a fusion reactor, found deep in the scow's depths; a reactor that the game steadfastly refuses to even acknowledge unless you specifically ask about it, and which is hidden behind a chunk of scenery. In other words, the only way you're going to find it without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">buying the hint book</a> is if you possess the gift of second sight, or you happen to be one of the designers.

Specifically, you're given a motherboard with a bunch of microchips with arcane instructions and serial numbers on them and expected to put them all in the right places. The real kicker is this is just the most <em>visually intimidating</em> puzzle; there are puzzles that are even harder in <em>Ripper</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTrappedTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTrappedTrilogy">The Trapped Trilogy</a></em> is infamous for ridiculous and confusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic Puzzles</a>. The one that springs to everyone's mind is the nonsensical fishing rod (glue a banana, rope, and knife together), although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans">evidence puzzle</a> in <em>Escape</em> is even more confusing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestVIRogerWilcoInTheSpinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestVIRogerWilcoInTheSpinalFrontier">Space Quest VI: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier</a></em>, the player has to reprogram a tricorder-like device by rearranging various chips and switches inside it. The solution is to decipher a series of clues in the game manual—"the red chip does not go next to the blue chip," that sort of thing—which, while not impossible, brings the game to a dead stop for anyone unskilled in such puzzles. (Amusingly, the puzzle hints were originally supposed to be in the game itself, not the documentation; because something got screwed up along the way, the puzzle was treated as copy protection on the Sierra message boards, meaning that posting an entire solution was a ban-worthy offense.)
</li><li> An infamous example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge">Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</a></em>. The player must open a pipe with no hint as to how to do so. The solution? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stick a banana on the spike of a ticking metronome, causing a piano playing monkey to become frozen and usable as a "monkey wrench".</span> Even worse is that this solution often got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a> and overseas; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"monkey wrench"</span> is a term often only used in America, which confused the living heck out of those living in other English countries.

<ul><li> The Spanish version of the game went around this by adding a book to the Phatt library titled <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"101 uses for monkeys"</span>, which explains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how monkeys can be used as "llaves inglesas" (spanish for "monkey wrenches")</span>. True, there's a chance that people might not take the book and miss the clue, but in general, the humor of the game made it more likely that people would read all the books in the library at least once, so there was a big chance to get it. The book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">doesn't explain WHY</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a monkey can be used as a wrench</span>, though, which, of course will confuse players.
</li></ul></li><li> In a game that was not too difficult for the time, especially if one was up on their Western fairy tales, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIQuestForTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIQuestForTheCrown">King's Quest I: Quest For The Crown</a></em> had a notorious example that got programmer Roberta Williams flooded with letters. To get a special item a character obviously reminiscent of Rumpelstiltskin would give you three chances to guess his name. But the correct answer was to actually use an alphabetic cipher (Z=A, etc.) and come up with the name "Ifnkovhgroghprm." The only clue was a note in a completely unrelated part of the game that said "It's good to think backwards." Tellingly, you could still win the game, just not score full points, if you used up all three guesses, and the remake just required players to spell "Rumpelstiltskin" backwards (although it didn't help that the programmers misspelled the name...).
</li><li> The first game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMirrorVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMirrorVideoGames">Black Mirror</a></em> trilogy has a few difficult sliding puzzles that cannot be skipped (unlike in the later games), but the one you find in the crypt in Wales during the third chapter is a doozy. On top of being a tricky 4 x 4 tile sliding puzzle with which you only have one empty tile to work with, just knowing what you need to do requires you to have a deeper knowledge of Western astrology than many people would likely have, specifically knowing the exact order the twelve astrological signs come in a year.
</li><li> There's a puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkFall">Dark Fall</a>: The Journal</em> which, while not difficult to figure out, can be <em>incredibly frustrating</em> to actually complete: placing four alchemical symbols on a table in <strong>exactly</strong> the right places. All four of which need to be lined up <em>perfectly</em> with some chalk lines and the wood-grain of the tabletop. With your only guidance being two halves of a black-and-white photo, which depicts their proper positions from <em>a tilted angle</em>, so it's extra-hard to see exactly where the symbols' edges are supposed to lie. Did I mention that one of the scraps of photo isn't even on the same <em>floor of the building</em> as the puzzle, and neither clue can be removed from its location?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a></em>. Use Squeaky Mattress with the other bed. You would think it's simple, but the game will frequently mistake you for trying to make noise with the mattress or Hoagie will say "Where'm I gonna put it?" when you just try to use the mattress.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLongestJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLongestJourney">The Longest Journey</a></em>'s infamous Rubber ducky puzzle. It isn't considered a bad puzzle by some, but it's very poorly placed. Within the first chapter (Wherein April has almost no reason to try and pick up everything that's not nailed down or go out of her way to obtain things that have no apparent use), April must obtain a key from a track that is not only out of her reach, but is electrified. How does April get this? Jerry-rig a grappling hook using an inflatable rubber ducky, a rope, and a clamp tool. It makes sense and is clever, but the problem comes more from the fact that April must gather a rubber ducky (that she has to chase for several screens) and <em>examine</em> the rubber ducky so that it will deflate in time to operate the clamp.
</li><li> The Goat Puzzle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenSwordTheShadowOfTheTemplars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenSwordTheShadowOfTheTemplars">Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars</a></em> is so notorious in its difficulty it has its own <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goat_Puzzle">Wikipedia page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. George must allow the goat to butt him, then click on the machinery as the goat returns to its position to move it, then let the goat charge again and get tangled in the machinery. This puzzle runs counter to every other puzzle in the game and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay">Unexpectedly Realistic Gameplay</a> to boot, and its legacy lives on in the minds of gamers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange">Life Is Strange</a></em>'s second episode features a section where the player is required to find five glass bottles in a junkyard. The only hint given for one of the bottles is that it's near a bonfire, so the logical conclusion is that it's near the old bonfire on the edge of the junkyard. Except there's also a <em>second</em> bonfire, which is completely hidden between two cars and the only way to find it is through the light smoke it puts out. The game creators realized how difficult this was and as such during the final episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> during the nightmare sequence</span>, Max will get annoyed at the prospect of having to find bottles again.

Unfortunately, the switches to do this were divided between three observation bays separated by lots of walking, and it was rarely possible to set them correctly on the first try. This puzzle was so loathed that the designer apologized for it in the sequel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersRoom">credits terminal</a>. When fans remade the game in an open source engine, the platform heights were initially made automatic but later restored to full difficulty for authenticity's sake.

The former requires you to use the Phoenix Cannon to bounce shots off a wall to hit a switch you can't see, then find two secret doors, drop a smart mine near the first one, and rush back to the other one and hope the blast from the smart mine unlocks it in time for you to get inside. The latter is even more complicated, requiring using markers to hold open doors and multiple guided missile tricks to access.

The hall has several obstacles and pitfalls littered around it, and it's only possible to hit the ball around nine times per run. Also, there's a time limit.

Did you know that if the person in the tunnel dies, you only have 4 chances, total? The puzzle's location is far in the level, making it irritating to reach. It's a subjective puzzle, since it depends on your partner being absolutely PERFECT at doing one of the tasks. The player on the buttons has to be in the exact center or else the snakes will kill the other player regardless of being raised or not.
</li><li> The multiplayer puzzle in the Great Magician's Palace in the first game is easier, but still irritating. The first part is the bad one, and it involves one player running back and forth pressing buttons to spawn cubes in a vertical shaft. The left button spawns a cube on the left, and the right one... well, it spawns a cube on the right. The trouble is that you need to move quickly, because the cubes will eventually despawn and leave Sackboy falling down to the bottom, but you also can't move TOO quickly, or else a cube will probably fall over and crush your Sackboy. When you get to the top, the game wants you to repeat this with the player on top jumping between buttons instead to spawn cubes for the player on the bottom, but you can just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingtheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingtheKnot">have the player at the top activate the checkpoint and have the player at the bottom kill themselves to spawn at the top</a>. The second part is much easier than that; it just has the players syncing up their movements so that one spawns platforms for the other so they can get over a pit of fire.
</li><li> Honorable mention goes to the 4X puzzles, but the trouble in that is merely <em>getting</em> four players together to attempt them.

It's especially aggravating in the second section, where the player will have to organize one set of monkeys perfectly to even get to roar at a specific monkey, who needs to be turned to finish the level. The fact that these puzzles sandwich an infuriatingly difficult ostrich-riding section doesn't help, and rumor has it that the game's chief designer had never once passed the second level.

It required the player to decode an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">entire language</a> where some characters have multiple different meanings, and an entirely new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">numeral system</a> where multiple symbols could have the same meaning. After that, you had to translate a tome which only looks like gibberish unless you read it in <em>3 dimensions</em>, where you read from the first character in each page systematically, which gives you <em>8 entirely new</em> riddles to solve! But that's not all, you have to use the page numbering in the tome to rearrange the numbering of the game's release date, and you translate THAT into Fez's language <em>again</em>, stack it into a 3 dimensional object and cast a shadow onto it at a certain angle to get the code. Fun fact: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">nobody did that.</a> They brute-forced their way through by systematically going through <em>82,000 combinations of button inputs</em> in order to get the correct code to complete the puzzle.

<ul><li> Many people considered the turtle puzzle (see above) to be "That One Puzzle" for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig">The Dig</a></em>. However, it became about ten billion times easier if you were lucky enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt">accidentally mouse over a fossil in the foreground that basically gave you the answer</a>. If you were one of those lucky few, then your "That One Puzzle" would have been the Planetarium, where the results of your dicking around in the planetarium could only be seen <em>from a particular spot</em> on a <em>completely different spire</em>, which you wouldn't notice unless you were taking screenshots before and after accidentally moving at least one of the moons into the right position. This was only ever solved by blind dumb luck or by reading the hint books.
</li><li> Sliding-tile puzzles are usually considered this, and they appear in too many games to list here.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPuzzle">Stock Puzzle</a> with water containers with 5 gallons and 3 gallons where you have to get 4 in one container is very hard the first time you try it. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rxxp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0rxxp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rxxp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fill the five gallon container, and fill the three gallon container from the five. Dump out the three, pour the remainder (two gallons) of the five into the three. Then refill the five and finish filling the three from the five, leaving you with four gallons in the five gallon container. Alternatively, fill the three, empty it into the five, fill the three again, and use it to fill the five. Empty the five, pour the one gallon in the three into the five, fill the three, and empty it into the five.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSeventhGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSeventhGuest">The 7th Guest</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aside from the bizarre and arbitrary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans">Solve the Soup Cans</a>, it has The Microscope Puzzle, which is a game of Infection against the AI. Unfortunately, rather than designing the AI to determine the best move with a limited amount of lookahead, the programmer wrote the AI to look ahead as far as it could - without limit - until a predetermined amount of time passed. It was probably possible to beat back in the days of Windows 3.1, but now it's borderline impossible without locking the available processor speed using an emulator such as DOSBOX.
</li><li> The Soup Cans puzzle is also infamous because it demands the player to spell out a coherent sentence using a handful of letters... and the only available vowel is Y. The solution provides foreshadowing for later events in the game (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Shy gypsy, slyly, spryly tryst by my crypt"</span>), but there's no way the player would know about it at that point. Fortunately, this puzzle is a lot easier if you check the in-game hint book (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Bashful nomad, craftily, agilely, meet secretly near my underground vault."</span>) and have a thesaurus on hand.
</li><li> There's also the attic puzzle, which also happens to be the very last puzzle in the game, and to an untrained eye will seem completely illogical and solvable only through trial and error: It's a model of a tower, with its walls laden with windows, and clicking on some makes lights appear in the windows, until the game seemingly takes over for you. There's a method to the madness, however: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The puzzle is essentially a programming puzzle, where the game remembers what kind of move was made for each shape of window, and will repeat that move for each window encountered. The challenge is to choose your moves so that you can advance to the top of the tower without bumping into the walls or going over previously-lit windows, but it gets even worse when you can make the puzzle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a> even if you get all the way up to the last part.</span>
</li><li> The Bishop puzzle is another notorious one. The objective is to switch the places of four white bishops and four black bishops on a 4x5 chessboard using standard diagonal moves without ever putting a bishop under attack by the opposing color. The small playing field makes movement very restricted, and because you can't ever put a bishop in harm's way, it's very easy to get turned around.
</li></ul></li><li> As for the sequel to <em>The 7th Guest</em>, <em>The 11th Hour</em>, there's the infamous Beehive puzzle, also known as the Honeycomb puzzle or "Blood and Honey" officially, which is essentially another version of the aforementioned Microscope puzzle from the last game, but played on a six-sided grid made of hexagons. The shape of the grid makes it just a bit easier to trap the AI and capture new cells, and the AI itself isn't quite as ruthless as before, but the game is still hard enough to be generally recognized as the point where most players quit the game.
<ul><li> The puzzle itself is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">skippable, but even the skip is hidden. To skip it, you need to ask for help until the game's built in helper offers to do the next move for you. Say "no", then ask for help again. Now the game will ask you if you'd like it to just complete the puzzle for you.</span>
</li><li> The final puzzle of the game is difficult, as befits being the equivalent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. However, the problem is that it's another AI game — in this case, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente">Pente<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — which must be completed three times in order to unlock all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> in a single save file; and each time you replay the game, the AI is given a bigger advantage over you<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u83n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u83n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u83n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The first time, you have the first move; next, the AI has the first move; and finally, that advantage is retained <em>and</em> it looks at least five moves ahead</span>.
</li><li> All of the AI games in the 11th Hour were designed on the basis that the AI should be as strong as possible, not that it should be fun to play against - which is not usual for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> in computer games, except for serious games such as Chess. Unsurprisingly, players in general found them to be frustrating and not fun.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrBrain">Dr. Brain</a></em> series has a couple of widely hated puzzles.
<ul><li> In <em>Castle of Dr. Brain</em>, it's either the magic square in the maths hallway or the find-a-word in the language hallway.
</li><li> In <em>The Island of Dr. Brain</em>, it'll be the randomised magic square in the volcano or the microscope puzzle on any difficulty other than Easy.
</li><li> <em>The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SgsCv6oZEY">had an entire level on "Music Theory."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The idea was to rearrange sheets of classical music so they matched up with the song they played. The difficulty could range from notes on the wrong line or stanzas switched up, to entire stanzas jumbling and symbols needing to be rearranged. If you knew nothing about classical music, let alone music sheets and music theory, this was 20 puzzles of pure hatred. And that's on Easy!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2jt77');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2jt77" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2jt77');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Playing on a harder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels">Difficulty Level</a> would make the puzzles harder, but you wouldn't have to do as many. Additionally, there were only four states for each measure, so if the notes or rhythm were off in a measure, you could easily fix it.</span>
<ul><li> The "File System" level is a simple case of memory on Easy... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFlFPr2HkaA">and when you get on harder difficulties, it becomes similar to a shell game with items going into and out of the drawers as you go.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> So, how's that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">eidetic memory</a> coming along?
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em>:
<ul><li> The subway puzzle in <em>Myst</em> can be a terror. It's so bad that a lot of players ended up mapping it out just to figure it all out; the idea was to listen to sounds and make use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">Trial-and-Error Gameplay</a> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find out each of them represented a cardinal direction</span>. Also, there's a problem in the Windows version of the game that causes the North and South sound to be flipped in this puzzle, but not in another puzzle that uses the same sounds. The worst part is that even if you know the solution, the puzzle takes an eternity and a half to complete thanks to needlessly long scene transitions. Oh, and you have to solve it <strong>twice</strong> to get both pages! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">The Miller brothers themselves have even acknowledged it as a mistake</a> on a few occasions, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://home.arcor.de/marlokir/mred/robyn.html">this interview.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Just getting to the Selenitic Age in the first place required solving a certain piano puzzle that was not too hard in and of itself... but this was back in the days when selecting your sound card from a list of pre-approved sound cards was still a thing, and getting sound to work correctly at all was a crapshoot/miracle. Some players resorted to literally counting the number of keys on the piano, assuming 1 key/note = 1 pixel, and then adjusting the sliders by <em>exactly that many pixels</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Many people will cite the animal puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Riven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Riven">Riven</a></em> (which relies on your finding five animals around the world of the game, three of which are obvious, but two of which are... not). The problem with the animal puzzle in <em>Riven</em> isn't necessarily solving it (though this isn't exactly easy); it's <em>telling the game</em> you have solved it. Note to game developers: if you're going to have people pick animals from a 25 digit keypad, don't put <em>three fish</em> on there and then ask the user to figure out which fish is the right one.
<ul><li> Even worse than the animal puzzle in <em>Riven</em> is the Fire Marble Puzzle. You are given a grid with colored marbles corresponding to the typical ROY G. BIV mnemonic. You are expected to put the marbles in specific spots on the grid, and these spots correspond to the Fire Marble Domes on the five islands in the game, and the domes each correspond to a certain color given in a completely different in-game language than your native tongue, and to find the spots you need to go to a topography map on one of the islands and then figure out the location of the domes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">then pinpoint those on the grid when the locations are extremely specific</a>, and argh, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>! It's not illogical, just rather unintuitive, and if you're not good at topography, it doesn't help. Oh, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">one of the marbles isn't even necessary to completing the puzzle</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The two timed puzzles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MystIVRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MystIVRevelation">Myst IV: Revelation</a></em> also stand out. They're not hard, exactly, just incredibly fiddly, especially when done very very quickly, as the game requires. Generally, one will be easier for a replaying gamer than the other, so if one is That One Puzzle for you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">then the other will likely be easier for you to figure out</a>. Ubisoft has acknowledged the problems with the timing on these puzzles too, and have released a patch for the game that makes the timing a bit more forgiving. They're still rather finicky, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LighthouseTheDarkBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LighthouseTheDarkBeing">Lighthouse: The Dark Being</a></em> is filled with these puzzles, but one stands out. In the temple you come across some kind of plant like shaped thing with two bell-arrangements on the outside and three levers on the inside. You get NO hints to operate the thing, there is no explanation anywhere, you don't even know what you are supposed to achieve and if you are making any progress at all. You can waste hours on that thing, just ringing the bells and pulling the levers.
<ul><li> Another good example is the puzzle box in the House of the Inventor. It combines 4 or 5 puzzles in one box. A 6×6 sliding puzzle is under it, some arbitrary clicking is involved and then some. You get a code from the box from one of the puzzles that you have to enter in a different side of the box. It is styled with squares, triangles, circles and rectangles. Now now, easy enough, right? There are four rotating disks, stacked on top of each other, each containing all 4 symbols. The obvious solution would be to try the 4 piece code you got forward and backward. Nope, does not work. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You have to turn all the disks to the first symbol, then all the disks to the second symbol and then enter the full code from top to bottom.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The final puzzle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Obsidian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Obsidian">Obsidian</a></em> is this for many players. When you're able to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip">Crossover Switch</a> that can seize control from the nanobot-controlling AI, Ceres, Max tells you to hit 8 buttons to access it. Except the AI put 8 fake buttons alongside them to delay you from interfering with its plans. The fake buttons move over each other if clicked on, and they all look exactly the same as the others unless the real ones are pushed, and the location of each button is random. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The trick is to look where the fake buttons moved and <em>not</em> touch them.</span>

The player has to decode a message written on a chocolate bar with seven squares (one blank to represent a space), and there are small bites taken out of some of the squares. The bites indicate the position of decrypted letters relative encoded letters on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a computer keyboard (so for example a bite on the left would mean "d" gets decoded to "f")</span> but since the in-game hints never mention the bites, most players simply assumed they were just eye candy (no pun intended).

The second, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving the justice minister</span>, isn't nearly as bad... except that it's the one time in the game that it's possible to have a checkpoint put in place after the situation has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a>, and gives you no indication you screwed up except that you can't do anything.

If you do that, they will fall in a heap and can't be moved. The solution... push an egg above the first rock, so that the falling of the others is delayed while it hatches. No previous level has used this trick. There isn't an egg anywhere nearby — you have to think of the idea and then fetch an egg from the opposite side of the level.

<ul><li> The word formula puzzles in which you need to click a series of buttons in the right order to produce a coherent sentence. This might not sound hard - and one of these puzzles <em>is</em> pretty straightforward with the buttons simply adding letters to the beginning and end of the current phrase - but many of these puzzles give you buttons that don't just add letters, but change a certain letter to another one or reverse the entire current phrase, which can fast lead to headaches trying to figure out just what kind of sentence you're supposed to create. The one from "The Dream" scroll, in particular, is so fiendishly difficult that it took <em>weeks</em> when the game first came out (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">back when GameFAQs didn't exist, mind you</a>) for someone to solve it - and the computer program they used to find the solution back then took <em>sixty hours</em> to do so!

</li><li> <em>The Secret of the Old Clock</em> has a sewing machine puzzle. Basically, you have to slowly run your mouse along a seam on a dress—but the problem is that you get even <em>slightly</em> off, you have to start all over.
</li><li> To complete <em>The White Wolf of Icicle Creek</em>, you have to win a Chinese Checkers-like game against the computer... three times. And you can't just beat it—you have to get your pieces into each of the four sides of the table once. This requires you to constantly change your strategy.
</li><li> <em>Ransom of the Seven Ships</em> has a puzzle that requires you to flip a series of different-sized hourglasses so they all run out of sand at the same time. As always, extreme precision is necessary—if you click on one of them even a second too late, you're starting over.
</li><li> <em>Shadow at the Water's Edge</em> has no less than three. The first requires you to arrange some wires in such a way that none of them are crossing. There are eighteen nodes with everything from three to eight wires on them. Good luck. The second is a recurring puzzle which has you arranging "bento boxes" for hungry customers (how bad is this one? There's a post on the game's message board <em>solely dedicated to these</em>). And finally, there's a puzzle which makes you cut a series of ropes to create a solid line of breaks. But there are about forty ropes to choose from, and there's a timer counting down: you have just enough time to make your cuts if you begin cutting the moment the timer does, so you'll probably end up restarting ten times just to get a grasp of the puzzle's layout.

<ul><li> The game, itself a game entirely consisting of brilliant puzzles, has a second mini-game layer of locks which you open by filling a rectangular space with a certain set of tetrominos. These are not bad as well, but they have a maddening, sharp difficulty spike where they go from absolutely elementary to exhausting (given a large enough space or specific enough figures set). If you're not a topography or geometry enthusiast, it often boils down to trying again and again blindly.
</li><li> All puzzles that occupy a large area have a tendency to become annoying fast because of the inordinate amount of running that's necessary to figure them out. <em>Road to Gehenna</em> has the worst examples by far, chief among them The Crater, which is not only pretty huge area-wise but also insanely difficult if you're after its star. Most stars can be acquired within 60-90 seconds if you know the solution. This one clocks in at a minimum of 5-6 minutes, and if you make one mistake, rectifying it can be so frustrating you're better off with a reset.
</li><li> "Egyptian Arcade" isn't the only "use jammers to skirt around mines" puzzle, but it's easily the most aggravating. Where most similar puzzles have two mines side-by-side so that jamming one for a time can create a window where you can zig-zag around the unjammed mines, this one has two mines <em>on the same line</em> in a corridor that's narrow enough to allow for no room to evade if you mess up your timing and short enough to make messing up the timing all too easy. To top it off, while struggling with this, you also have to juggle two jammers and two electric doors. Even "Nerve-Wrecker", a remarkably similar silver glyph puzzle, is easier to handle because of the increased space in spite of having a vastly larger number of mines.
</li><li> Getting the star hidden in "Up Close and Jammed" is incredibly annoying for the simple fact that it's easy to get caught in a position that can only be fixed by <em>starting the entire level over from scratch</em>.

Aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> below, the infamous sunken ship panel has a reputation for being unintuitive in the extreme. Blow revealed in an AMA for Reddit that this was the puzzle he was thinking of when he off-handedly stated that "only 1% of players" would be able to solve it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's a multi-layered, well hidden audio puzzle. It incorporates elements from puzzles all over the island, except mashed up to the point that realizing what's involved is half the puzzle. The bamboo forest's sound element is here, though it's part of the environment and not obviously artificial, leading some players to ignore it completely. The symmetry line from the ocean pillars is included as well, though it's invisible, and the colors that normally indicate its presence are muddled by a red light from the Greenhouse tinting everything.</span>
</li><li> The keep. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The garden mazes themselves aren't too hard, but you have to remember the solution to <em>all four</em> puzzles in order to activate the beacon, two of the four at different angles from the original puzzle. The other side of the keep, with the pads you have to step on to activate, requires a similar mechanic to the garden mazes, but while the garden beacon at least follows the layout, the mechanical beacon does not, which means you have to follow the solution while remaining dead-on.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Thankfully</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only one of the puzzles, garden-beacon or mechanical-beacon, is needed to activate it.</span>
</li><li> For colorblind and/or hearing impaired players, there are two sections of the game which can be difficult, if not impossible, to complete. They can't be mentioned without spoiling the entire mechanics of the areas, but here goes, for those curious: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the jungle area puzzles are based entirely on the audio pitches of birdsong</span>, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the greenhouse bunker works entirely on manipulating colours of light to find the "true" puzzle.</span> One puzzle in the keep also relies on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> audio cues</span> to solve, and two additional (one in the hub/town and another on the shipwreck) run on recognizing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how the audio cues work when translated to a geometrical representation — something explored in the jungle section</span>. On this, Blow has said that he and his team ultimately decided to keep these puzzles intact, allowing the player to bypass them by only requiring seven of the eleven lasers to be fired the mountain in order to open it — which is alright, until one realizes that the endgame <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inside the mountain</span> includes puzzles full of colour-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> where solutions are required in order to finish the game. Color-blind players may also have trouble with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the walkways through the trees, which are all about the different-colored suns.

Fifth, in one section, you're given multiple panels to solve at once, in which <em>only one of them can actually be solved</em>; you have to figure out which one it is in addition to actually solving it. And the massive rotten cherry on top? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">It's all timed</a></em>: if the music stops (or you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">pause</a>), all the panels shut down, meaning you have to go back and <em>do the whole thing over again</em>.

The correct rules are actually given in the other puzzles on the same level — the same rules apply to <em>all</em> the "wheel" puzzles, and there are only two: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> #1: The solid yellow block must align with <em>either</em> a solid yellow or hashed yellow block. #2: The two yellow lines must align with an empty space, including the borders where there are no adjacent wheels.﻿</span> Many a player has completed this puzzle with pure trial and error, never really understanding why the solution is what it is.

Not only that, but unlike most others in the game, the puzzle cannot be skipped; using the hint button merely has the player observe that "I should move on" or a similarly worded sentiment; and the in-game strategy guide (included in the collector's edition) <em>omits the puzzle entirely</em>. Best of all, because the reward for solving it is a necessary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a>, the game cannot proceed until this puzzle is completed.

Although each one starts out solvable without cheating, most of the normal game rules aren't suspended on the <em>Sokoban</em> levels, which can lead to things like monsters shattering boulders with wands of striking, immobile jellies spawning behind them, giants picking them up and throwing them at you, and so forth. Thankfully, not only are the <em>Sokoban</em> levels optional (although you'll probably want the rewards for the long term), but you can cheat the game in various ways with only a small Luck penalty.
</li><li> In the mobile game <em>Toy Blast</em>, level 336 requires you to rescue an elephant and a rhino. The animal toys start at the top of the left side of the playfield, a 2×9 column with warps at the bottom. The warps lead to the center of a 6×9 area on the right side. Unfortunately, those warp exits are blocked by two columns of white bricks, each of which starts with two smaller black bricks attached; to clear just one brick on this level requires that three matches be made next to it. And both animal toys have to be rescued within only 36 moves.

Put simply, you have to get a piece of fruit out of a high tree, which is solved by knocking it into the water. From there, it's a very long, very drawn out puzzle of using musical cues to have animals act in such a way that the fruit moves closer to you. All the while, you have to get into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>, trek through the dungeon, and avoid using the wrong command that could potentially force you to start completely over. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> comes in from at least half your party having magic and skills that should allow them to get the fruit with ease, including one character that can call upon the Summon Spirit of Water, and another character that can <em>fly</em>. The option to have them help never comes up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, there are four puzzles in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Meggiora Highlands</a>, the first of these being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockPuzzle">Block Puzzle</a> that makes the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos">Tower of Zosma</a> feel like a pushover in comparison. You have to push four blocks onto four particular 1×1 spaces on a 12×12 grid. They all start unlit, and to push them, you must light them, rather like torches. Doesn't sound so bad, right? Forgot to mention that when you push one, the other blocks that are lit go in the same direction as the one you're pushing. And that the blocks that are unlit also go in the opposite direction. And that there are barricades around two of the spaces you're supposed to be pushing them onto, facing in different directions. AND the spaces you're pushing these blocks onto are very much spread out. To add insult to injury, the three other puzzles are insultingly easy. To add more insult to injury, your reward for doing this is to remove one spell from the boss' repertoire, causing it to just cast the ones it'll still have; this is the case with the other puzzles as well, but at least their difficulty justifies that. To add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">MORE</a> insult to injury, when you do three of the puzzles, the other one's reward becomes... nothing. The good news is that that last bit makes this one skippable, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">good luck finding that out on your own</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos">Baten Kaitos</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Zosma Tower has five floors of fiendishly hard, timed, 3D block puzzles. This is the only part in the game where the camera will screw you over, and that just adds to the difficulty. To start the puzzles, you have to have a fire in your quest magnus, which you use to light a torch, which powers the puzzles. If you take too long, the torch goes out and the puzzle resets. If you run out of fire, you have to go back down the tower and get more from the bottom. Also, at the top of the tower is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
</li><li> Later in the game, you get Mizuti's sidequest, which involves going into the basement of the tower to solve five more block puzzles, which are even harder. The second puzzle is the worst, with one step that requires <em>insane</em> timing to bounce a block off an elevator. Also, at the end, you fight the Wizard Shadow, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">the same mechanic as Xelha's fight against the Ice Goddess</a>.

Of all the puzzles in the entire freakin' game, <em>this</em> is the one that gets you stuck. The rules are oblique - you have to move each goat statue to its proper hole (look at the base to find where it must end up), the statues can only move to a golden tile, and leave silver tiles in their wake. It is very possible for the uninformed to fubar themselves without realizing it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">mercifully, you can leave the room to make it reset</a>), and if you slide the wrong statue onto the wrong hole, the room resets immediately.
<ul><li> There's also the fact that unlike in every other puzzle where Insight Psynergy only shows you icons on objects that can be interacted with the respective Psynergy, here it actually reveals the entire solution. Good luck figuring that one out considering how utterly useless it is for most of the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> had a minor one: a simple sliding block puzzle where you moved a torch-bearing pillar onto a tile. However, water keeps falling on the one spot the pillar <em>has</em> to go through, and it takes very precise timing to avoid the torch being extinguished. When you finally succeed, the game plays a little victory chime... the same as when you unlock the final dungeon.
</li><li> The Lost Age has one in the Great Gabombo statue filled with enormous rotating gears. The only hint you get is a rat that bounces from one gear to another, and is liable to be dismissed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a>, since it doesn't show how you climb the gears in the first place.

When Lan's on a cruise ship, a major object on said ship is stolen. No one in the room has it, and no one's entered or left between the presentation (where the object is shown, secured) and when the object was taken. This one's fairly simple - everything is wireless and the various mirrors lying around could potentially reflect an infrared signal to the jack-in port. Just after, though, is a very confusing puzzle - the place where the culprit fled is behind a door sealed with a code. All you have to go on is some odd word puzzle. Mercifully, the code is in all numbers, and the poem for the code is full of numbers.
<ul><li> There's also the puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork4RedSunAndBlueMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork4RedSunAndBlueMoon">Mega Man Battle Network 4: Red Sun and Blue Moon</a></em>. In this section you end up entering codes consisting on three numbers to pass through each gate, each one has the hint in there. You get your usual math problems so far... but then you get one whose only hint is "HI = HE???". So, how is this supposed to yield a three-number answer? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Well, the question marks are supposed to be blank spaces and you're supposed to fill in those spaces by thinking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo">L33t L1ng0</a></em> of all things.

Thankfully, this is totally optional. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3dbry');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3dbry" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3dbry');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The shrines of Kynareth, Talos, Mara, and Dibella are in their respective temples. Julianos, being the god of wisdom and logic, can be found at the Atronach Forge in the College of Winterhold. Stendarr doesn't have a priesthood to call his own, but he has the Vigilants: check at the Hall of the Vigilant. At the entrance to High Hrothgar is the shrine of the dragon god Akatosh. As for the aforementioned Arkay and Zenithar? Find them in the wreckage of dead traders' carts on the road between Rorikstead and Dragon Bridge, and just east of of the giant camp south of Windhelm, respectively.</span>

Essentially, you're given a room full of trash cans that had a locked gate at the end. To open the gate, you had to find two secret switches in the cans. The first one was placed randomly, and the second one was guaranteed to be 'one trash can away' from the first one. Unfortunately, that left you with between three and <em>eight</em> trash cans to pick from, and if your first guess wasn't correct, then the puzzle would reset. What's worse is that the puzzle is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">completely bugged</a> in the Generation 1 games (no surprises there) and doesn't even work as intended: the second can is often <em>not</em> "one away" from the first. In fact, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Yellow</a> it's possible for the second trash can to <em>not be generated at all</em>. meaning no amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> will save you from having to reset the puzzle.

The area has a puzzle where three switches open and close the walls in a maze. The switches have to be pressed in a certain order to open the right path to the next room. The player needs to move away from a switch to even see the whole maze and see if you got it wrong, making it a wee bit tedious.

Turns out you need to know how the days of the week got their names and have the information enough in mind to realize what the clues are referencing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a></em> your party comes across a dilapidated bridge. When you approach you are presented with text stating that it doesn't look safe enough to cross. Unfortunately the game never actually hints that getting to the other side would be desirable, and given the large maps and the game's nature of forcing you to hunt through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> for hidden doors and barely visible corridors it is extremely easy to turn your attentions elsewhere. Even if you did know that you were supposed to cross the bridge the solution to this 'puzzle' is far from straightforward. The intended solution is to find a book on bridge engineering from a different part of the map, possesion of which apparently gives your party the architectural confidence to proceed. Unfortunately the game is full of useless and worthless books, and by this late stage is it highly likely that the player will dismiss any books they find out of hand without even bothering to read the title.

In the beginning, all tiles are face down. When you flip one, all tiles adjacent to it flip as well. Sounds easy? Well, good luck solving this puzzle without looking up how to do it.
<ul><li> There are two more of the same type of puzzle in the <em>Jaws of Hakkon</em> DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. Instead of flipping all of the tiles, however, you need to flip them to create a certain pattern, as hinted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nearby mats in front of locked doors. Creating the patterns will unlock the doors in question</span>. Thankfully, unlike the DAII example, these are optional.

Sound easy enough? It would be except that some people either give no proper answer at all or give resolutions that could cover multiple answers, making it difficult to determine what the most popular resolution is. To make the situation worse, the entire quest takes place on a battlefield screen, which means you're forced to have your party go door to door and person to person to conduct the interviews, which can take awhile to cover the entire town unless you cast Haste on everyone and/or use units that have a high Move stat. If you fail the quest, then you get to have fun repeating the quest again and running all over the map listening to everyone yet again.

The problem? You're on a strict time limit, the code is randomized for each playthrough, and Cid knows some of the code but his hints are unbelievably vague, in some cases listing 2 different buttons and saying what the button is <em>not</em>. Unlike other games this doesn't tell you which buttons you got right and which you got wrong. This can lead to you losing out on the Bahamut ZERO materia which requires each piece of huge materia to claim.

When you start the clock on a crystal number, the hands move to the number you pick, and then spread apart, i.e. if you pick a 1, then the hands move to the 1 space and they each move over one space, and then the 1 disappears. If both hands land on empty spaces, then you have to reset the clock. The objective is to clear all the crystal numbers, of which there can be up to thirteen. For extra fun, most of the clock puzzles have a short time limit.

The only one of these that is likely to give players trouble is one where Papyrus decided to redesign it to look more like his face but in doing so messed up the solution.

Even if you don't have that issue, the controls are pointlessly unwieldy, so it might take you several tries because you keep playing a note you <em>know</em> isn't the one you wanted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Newer versions of the game have the melody appear on the wall where/when you activate the melody, in control form</a>, so the hearing impaired, tone-deaf, and tone-sensitive can solve the puzzle more easily.

In the last testimony, where you can't outright prove the culprit's guilt but instead have to prolong the case (which is very long, so your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp">penalty bar</a> is probably low) you'll reach a testament from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a> in which you can press statements and the Judge asks you if it's relevant or not. Nothing in these statements gives you any evidence, so you're inclined to say it's important because you don't want to waste the Judge's time. One of these statements will give you a slipup by the killer in his pronouns, and THIS you have to flag.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em> has a rare out-of-court example in Case 5. You have to open a box by rotating its four segments so their pictures match the respective verses of a song. The problem is that three out of the fours verses have obvious picture matches, while the third has no clear one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You have to rotate the third segment <em>halfway between two different pictures</em>, so the end of one and the beginning of another are viewed as one picture that fits the meaning of the song's third verse.</span> The only thing that might tip the player off to this is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using the D-Pad to rotate the box's segments goes between full pictures and the corners in-between, rather than from one complete picture to another</span>, but it's still a big leap.
</li><li> The bonus case of the first game features a puzzle where you have to manipulate a jar so that its silhouette matches a specific shape. The problem is, it's very sensitive so sometimes, even if you think you got it right, it won't except it because it was just slightly off center. Thankfully you don't get penalized for screwing up this puzzle but it can take a damn long time to solve.

<ul><li> The torture room lives up to its name — its final puzzle has you fiddling around with switches on two separate screens, so there's no way to know if you actually have all of the switches you can currently work with in the right spot or not and just need to switch the other two, and unlike most puzzles in the game, there are no in-game hints. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> when you realize that the torture room is down the "wrong path", the one that doesn't lead to the door with the #9 on it at all — the fact that the Building Q group isn't able to get hints like they can for most puzzles should signal them that <em>it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>!</em></span>
</li><li> The final puzzle with numbered balls in the Study can be this if you take one rule for granted: that you have to fill in both areas. You have been doing this in the previous three puzzles, so why should it be different in this one? It's impossible to complete the last one with this mentality. The game never tells you this, but you've probably assumed it. You'd be surprised how many people fall into this trap and look for an impossible solution for ages.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's this very irritating dice-moving puzzle. In the Archives, it's fairly simple to match up the clues and solve the puzzle because all you need to do is have the right colors in the right place OR the right numbers in the right place; but in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Q Room</span>, it becomes <em>much</em> harder because now not only do the colors AND numbers have to be right, they also have to face specific ways, which requires a certain combination of movements for each die... hopefully the other dice don't get in the way of those movements!
</li><li> When you go into the Director's Office, there's a puzzle that involves making a parallelogram. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if the detection on the parallelogram wasn't absolutely faulty. Many times, you can have a perfect parallelogram, only for the detection to not realize that it's a parallelogram, and you don't complete the puzzle.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Each episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple">Legends of the Hidden Temple</a></em> ends with a timed run through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TempleOfDoom">Temple of Doom</a>, where each room has some puzzle you need to solve to proceed to the next room. Of import is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">The Shrine of the Silver Monkey</a>, where you must find the three pieces of the monkey statue, reassemble them in the correct orientation on the pedestal in the middle of the room, and push down on the head to lock it in place and open the next room. Apparently this is really, really hard to do. Contestants couldn't find the pieces, or they would get the orientation wrong, or put the base on top of the torso, or couldn't press down hard enough to trigger the door, or simply weren't tall enough to reach the shelf one of the pieces was on. Many a game would go smoothly until they reached the shrine, then they would waste the game in that room. Worse still, even if they completed the puzzle, there was a chance a Temple Guard would be in the room to try to end their run anyway.
