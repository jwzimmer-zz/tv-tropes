</div></div><p>There are many ways in which a commercial can fail to get its message across. Some ads are uninteresting; others are so bad that they turn more viewers against the product than they attract. But some commercials fail because they're too <em>good</em>.
</p><p>A commercial that's too clever, or features too memorable a gimmick, runs the risk of being remembered only for the gimmick and not its association with the product. The commercial has performed the important task of holding the audience's attention, but it hasn't spread the word about the product it's trying to promote. While in the era of the Internet, it can be argued that any commercial that makes people want to run a Google search for the company or product's name is a successful one, this trope already existed long before anybody had even conceived of search engines.

<ul><li> Infiniti's <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/0R6Gl94FEo4">early<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/5rIUAuW6vLk">advertising<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed only the brand name and a flock of birds. Nothing to indicate that it was actually promoting a <em>car</em>.
<ul><li> Lampshaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a>: "All you saw in the magazine ads were ocean waves, leading you to wonder: Is this a submersible car? Or was there some kind of accident during the photo session? ('Damn it, Bruce, I TOLD you the tide was coming in!')"
</li></ul></li><li> A documentary about a newly-launched airline. Because the airline's ad was so non-specific, there were people who came asking them what they actually do.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/qzrTqX62cyk">A baby dashing through a darkened hospital before crashing through a wall.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The commercial was for the VW Lupo  "Volkswagen's tough little baby".
</li><li> Honda had a very long and very strange (but compelling) ad some years ago on British television. It had a very catchy, if bizarre song ("hate something, change something...") sung by Garrison Keillor, who's not well-known in Britain, and was full of bright and surreal imagery. It also had a fun flash game, but it took three or four close viewings before anyone realized that it was a Honda commercial. And it took a trip to the website to realize what the commercial was about.
<ul><li> Honda is still doing this with all its adverts, failing to mention a single car or why their cars are better than the rest, only that Honda likes complicated puzzles and skydiving. In the UK, anyway; their US ads tend to be of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">this is the car, this is the deal you can get</a>" variety with the only touch of whimsy being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobPaulsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobPaulsen">"Mr. Opportunity"</a>, a cartoon car salesman surrounded by live-action cars in a live-action showroom.
<ul><li> For many people, these adverts are <em>so</em> spectacular they cross the line twice, being so memorable it's hard to forget what they're advertising. Particularly the one which was only shown in full in cinemas (it was two minutes long) where the guy drives a wide variety of Honda vehicles across land and sea whilst singing "The Impossible Dream" and rides up out of a waterfall in a hot-air balloon with the Honda logo at the end. Now <em>that's</em> advertising.
</li></ul></li><li> Honda also made an ad called <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/rYabfifhEPE">Cog.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It's a two-minute chain of events that you generally see in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> deathtrap scene (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubeGoldbergDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubeGoldbergDevice">Rube Goldberg Device</a>), culminating in a finished car and the voiceover "Isn't it nice when things just work?" The commercial itself is a masterful achievement; filmed in two takes edited seamlessly together and containing no CGI. But nothing about the commercial itself screams "Honda."
<ul><li> A key point of difference between the "Cog" and "Hate Something" ads and the more successful "The Impossible Dream" was that the latter had every vehicle and the driver clad in their simple red and white colour scheme, making it so strong through the advert that it acted as much for letting everyone know Honda had this colour scheme as for letting them know that Honda made cars. That helps with brand identification which then helps with recognising further Honda ads which helps allowing further leeway before running into this trope in the future.
</li></ul></li><li> Honda seems to like to have one of these long feature adverts per year. One of them featured a full choir performing the sounds of a car during its journey, using nothing but their voices. This was, like Impossible Dream and Cog, only shown in full in cinemas (with crowds sometimes joining in the choir's singing).
</li></ul></li><li> Somebody did a series of wonderful adverts about a car that said you should <em>ask before you borrow it</em>. One had a couple going into a mad passionate clinch over the dinner table, her dragging him upstairs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToABed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToABed">handcuffing him, and walking off</a> leaving him looking at a note with the slogan on it. Another had a slow breakup song and a woman throwing the man's possessions out of the bedroom window as he came home, looked at the car keys in his hands. The car was the Nissan Micra.
<ul><li> The same car brand had <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/xkt8L0NtSjA">an advert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a>. About the only thing at all about the ad that anyone got was that they made portmanteaus out of favourable adjectives for cars. People agreed that the advert was very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">shiny and bright</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> An ad about a Peugeot car used the usual format for car commercials (people talking, arrows pointing with descriptions) but replacing all language with pure gibberish, except for the line "Try it and you'll understand". While some of the made-up words became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutations</a> ("bloblor", anyone?) very few people can remember <em>which</em> car was publicized.
</li><li> A 1995 British ad depicted a man driving a Jaguar car in the middle of a forest, before stopping, unpacking an air pump, and pumping with a smirk on his face as it is eventually revealed that he is pumping up a blow-up doll. It's an ad for Goodmans car audio systems, but the ad makes no mention of that—it merely calls Goodmans "Britain's second-favourite in-car entertainment".
</li><li> An example from Italy, a 2002 commercial  a woman is in her flat, talking on the phone. She's arguing with her boyfriend, and in the end she shouts "I'll go out and date the first man I meet" and hangs up. In another flat, a man is washing dishes and hears all that yelling. When the woman opens the door to go out, the man is there, on her landing, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.corriere.it/Media/Foto/2002/09_Settembre/10/buonaseeera/image.jpg">still wearing his apron and rubber gloves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, ready to become that "first man". His catchphrase "Buonaseeera" ("Good eeevening") became extremely popular. The ad also had a sequel with the same man and a different woman, and this time the woman said the catchphrase. These commercials were so popular that people started to quote the catchphrase every now and then, the actor was nicknamed "Mr. Buonaseeera", the apron and gloves were auctioned for charity...but the actual advertised product was soon forgotten, and the <em>actual</em> ad motto was forgotten too (the phrase <em>intended</em> to be the motto was "Cogli l'attimo", i.e. "seize the opportunity"/"carpe diem"; it advertised a special price for a Fiat car, a car which <em>never appears in the ads</em>, which are always shot indoors!).
</li><li> An ad a few years ago had big beasts with headlights and brakes and stuff in a rodeo championship, with one cocky guy falling off and a more careful guy having a perfect ride. Included were herds of these beasts running on the roads and one drinking out of a trough in a gas station. Its point was supposed to be a lecture in SUV safety.
</li><li> There was a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/YQo95oI4nXY">German ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> impersonator whose car breaks down, so he has to hitchhike. In his car, he had a little Elvis puppet standing on the dashboard, shaking its pelvis when the car vibrates. When he's picked up by a woman driving the advertised car, he puts the puppet to her dashboard, only to see that lil' Elvis doesn't dance anymore  said car goes so softly, there are no more vibrations. Everyone remembers the mascot (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler">which you could buy afterwards</a>). Hardly anyone remembers which car it was for.
</li><li> The fact that so many car ads are like this is parodied by <em>The Symmetrical Breadpazoid</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.drunkduck.com/The_Symmetrical_Breadpazoid/index.php?p=584432">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> One ad showed a car zooming along a cliffside road while music reminiscent of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movie soundtrack plays. No commentary at all. The car pulls into the driveway of a mansion; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickMacnee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickMacnee">Patrick Macnee</a> gets out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">smiles directly into the camera</a>, and asks "You were expecting someone else?" (The ad was for "Sterling", a short-lived attempt at importing the cars sold by the British brand Rover to the US; it didn't work out, chiefly because they were essentially luxurious versions of Honda models, and Honda had already launched their own luxury marque, Acura, by this point.)
</li><li> An ad for the Kia Soul <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU-ZpG4NvDE">opens with a shot of a war-torn battlefield, where fighting rages on<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Exoskeletons duel for control of a floating island. A soldier is picked up and flung like a ragdoll. Suddenly, a green car drives in. Three hamsters get out. And they <em>dance</em>. They danced to the Party Rock Anthem, no less! A previous Kia ad featuring the same hamsters had them singing a rap version of Weapon of Choice, with "this" being a Kia while "that" was other hamsters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">driving around in shoes, cardboard boxes, and washing machines instead</a>.
</li><li> A Jaguar ad from the mid-2000s was filmed entirely in black-and-white and showed young, ultra-wealthy people frolicking in the Hamptons to a tasteful soundtrack. The car actually featured in the ad, but more as background filler than an advertised product. It was less about the car and more the lifestyle.
</li><li> Volkswagon released <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL3V7wSnUFI">this minute-long commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Super Bowl XLVI, which is just a choir of dogs barking the Imperial March from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> with no connection to the actual car aside from the name and slogan at the very end. The <em>Star Wars</em> connection is <em>semi</em>-justified if you remember one of their ads for the previous year, which featured a boy dressed as Darth Vader attempting to use The Force, which ends with his father hitting the ignition button on the keys to let him think he started it. Without that knowledge, the whole thing is <em>completely</em> nonsensical until the name shows up about a minute in.
</li><li> A 2012 commercial begins with someone taking a plate of food out of the microwave as a narrator says "holiday leftovers. There's nothing simpler...unless it's getting the new &lt;car model&gt;" as the commercial goes into full sale mode showing off the cars and talking about them. There wasn't even <em>effort</em> put into this one's gimmick.
</li><li> There's a frequently-run Fiat ad that features several copies of the car in question driving off cliffs into the ocean. Then they drive back out of the ocean somewhere else, unharmed. Apparently this symbolizes the cars being imported to the U.S. from Italy, but the brand, model, etc. isn't very memorable after seeing a bunch of cars behave like migrating penguins.
<ul><li> A sequel of sorts has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">Paul Revere</a> announcing that "The Italians are coming" because a bunch of driverless Fiats are zooming through town, and then everyone throws a party. Because it's the "Italian invasion" or...something. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Are they trying to sell us 250-year-old cars?</a>
</li><li> In 1992, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20438_the-6-most-baffling-marketing-disasters-by-famous-companies.html">Fiat had a new car<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that they intended to market towards unmarried working women. To target this demographic, they used a direct mail campaign by making a list of 50000 career women, and writing each of them an anonymous, personally addressed "love letter" full of stalkerish lines like "I saw you on the street and knew we were made for each other", that in no way mentioned their car or indicated that it was a marketing campaign. When droves of frightened women filed police reports, believing that they were being stalked, Fiat came clean and cancelled the campaign, which apparently would have included sending a series of similar letters to the same women, which would eventually reveal themselves to be advertisements.
</li></ul></li><li> A commercial that aired in the 2000s for the Toyota Yaris cars had a blonde man in a strange suit named "Uncle Yaris", and the ads would tell you about him; one ad had him at a supermarket check-out taking various things out of his pockets and a banana out of his sock, ending with the tagline "Uncle Yaris can carry a lot." Cars were at no point mentioned in the commercial, nor was Toyota, and viewers who didn't know what a Yaris was were forced to Google the name to find out.
</li><li> Some viewers get so caught up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a> of the <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/fxVH5sKUlPg">"You and Your Johnson"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> video, they overlook the fact it actually advertises outboard motors for boats.
</li><li> The first few Carfax ads had the slogan "We know cars" displayed pretty prominently, but failed to state what their company actually <em>does.</em> What do they know about cars? Do they sell them? Fix them? Later commercials cleared up the mystery.
</li><li> Nicely subverted in a Hyundai advert for Spain. The ad opens with a series of shots of landscapes that wouldn't have been out of place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> films, then it cuts to a fairy who looks at the camera and complains that there are too many bells and whistles just to sell a car. The ad focuses completely on the car from then on.
</li><li> A commercial for Autoway Tires. The ad starts with a disclaimer and health warning and then shows a dark, snowy road from the driver's night vision POV, before stopping in front of a woman dressed in white robes... which leads to <em>a horrific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a></em>.

<ul><li> In Britain, everyone remembers Nick (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a></em>) Park's <em>Creature Comforts</em> concept (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Claymation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Claymation">Claymation</a> animals with genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoxPops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoxPops">Vox Pops</a> voices) being used for a series of well-regarded British Gas adverts in the 1990s. Except the adverts were for the Electricity Board, and emphasised how much better electric heating was than gas.
</li><li> Diesel had a series of <a class="urllink" href="http://webecoist.com/2008/12/27/creative-ads-environment-humanity/">print ads<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> concerning Global Warming which featured young, beautiful people in the foreground. Viewers didn't really notice the submerged landmarks in the background which were <em>supposed</em> to be the focus. That said, given that the brand is named after a freaking <em>polluting fossil fuel</em>, the concept was bound to fail anyway.
</li><li> General Electric's "Ecomagination" campaign to promote green energy, featuring dancing elephants and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/41mGkBTK6PM">rock star cows<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> One Christian group has a billboard ad campaign with nothing but the line "I Am Second" and a link to their website. Some people can see it's a coded reference to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:30&amp;version=NIV">John 3:30<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but otherwise it suggests....a sport? A band? An athletics clothing manufacturer?
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/3iAXP_bKsv0">This ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from Canada, for The Salvation Army, features happy music and a girl wearing grungy clothes in a subway station imagining twirling around in a pink dress, swinging on a swingset, and being read a bedtime story being read to her by her mom. Had it not have been for the final shot featuring the tagline and the Salvation Army's logo, you'd have thought it was an advertisement for something totally different. Justified to some degree; the Salvation Army being a charitable group (a church, too, but mostly a charitable organization) with a focus on providing for the poor and particularly poor children, the girl's daydream <em>is</em> what they're "selling".
</li><li> The Foundation for a Better Life commercials that often are shown in American movie theaters and on TV are something of an inversion: they usually depict someone doing a good deed, then say "pass it on..brought to you by the Foundation for a Better Life." Viewers might assume these are trying to sell them on the Foundation, but the Foundation is a nonprofit whose purpose is to encourage people to do more good deeds, meaning that the demonstration of the good deed is the point of the advertisement.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.values.com/inspirational-sayings-billboards">Their billboard series<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> takes a similar approach: showing a famous or semi-famous person who overcame some sort of barrier, and admonishing those who see it to "pass it on!"
</li></ul></li><li> The Atheist Bus Campaign. The ads demand that you stop being religious and the links for the people involved are shown in very tiny text, thus confusing many.

The commercials consist of absolutely nothing but 10-20 similarly dressed actor/models in front of a solid white background singing Top 40 tunes while standing absolutely still and looking bored out of their minds. Until they flash the slogan (everybody in leather/vests/khakis) and the Gap logo, they look like the world's laziest music video.
</li><li> A Levi's ad showed two very young teens apparently about to "do the deed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime">for the first time</a>", slowly undressing and talking about being scared and trusting. Then they turn and jump off a pier into the water. What is there to let you know it's an ad for Levi's? A brief logoshot at the very end. That's it.
<ul><li> Another series of Levis ads, some running over a minute long, consisted of nothing but unrelated snippets of young people partying outdoors, accompanied by a reading of Walt Whitman's <em>Pioneers! O Pioneers!</em>
</li></ul></li><li> One of the most surreal ads <em>ever</em> featured a hamster running furiously in his wheel until it breaks and he dies of boredom. It only ran for a short time, and if anybody remembers it today it's for the artificial outrage certain tabloid papers tried to stir up about the portrayal of a dead pet. So what was the product? <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/CCzsEgUcWfU">Levi's.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> They did several ads like that at this time, didn't they? There was an ad with a toddler hammering a square peg into a round hole...
<ul><li> Evidently those ads <a class="urllink" href="http://spirochaetetrail.blogspot.com/2016/07/levis-hamster-1998-alas-poor-kevin.html">according to this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "was part of a wider campaign, devised by advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, built around deliberately weird and surreal situations, which hinted toward a vague kind of theme about originality and the importance of thinking outside of the box." Kevin the hamster died because of a failure to think outside the box. Others include <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoC39YNsSiY">Wives<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_0SbtHQJAQ">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there were Levi's 80s-era ads. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Nlnls3RlUVc">This one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a good example of what you would see- samurai lizards, tiny little anthropomorphic Levi's logos, and a Tarzan knockoff who would always run into trouble. Maybe the thinking was "everybody <em>knows</em> we make jeans, so let's just spend 30 seconds doing weird stuff"?
</li></ul></li><li> The controversial Nike ad featuring Tiger Woods that began airing shortly before the 2010 Masters. It features a still shot of Tiger's face as he listens to an audio recording of his dead father. Although reaction is mixed on whether the ad is disgusting or brilliant, no one seems to know exactly what the hell the ad is specifically selling. The best guess anyone can come up with is that the ad is promoting the resumption of Tiger Woods as a viable advertising spokesman after the affair scandal that destroyed his marriage in 2009.
</li><li> Compare the amount of people who know about <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/RzToNo7A-94">Terry Tate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the amount of people who know that the entire Office Linebacker series was an advert for Reebok.

Sales of the specific product being advertised (Old Spice Red Zone After Hours Body Wash) actually dropped slightly after the ads' debut, and most viewers would probably be surprised to learn it was even for a <em>specific</em> Old Spice product. However, it turns out that's not such a bad thing. Sales of the the Old Spice brand as a <em>whole</em> increased by a whopping 150-200%, and (more importantly) Old Spice is no longer thought of as "that aftershave your grandpa wears." One gets the feeling that Procter &amp; Gamble management is currently laughing its way to the bank.
</li><li> Gillette did a razor ad starring Green Bay Packers LB Clay Matthews III. It's mostly game footage of Matthews with a voice-over about how strong and fast he is, followed by a few seconds of him shaving at the very end.
</li><li> A commercial aired with a number of people talking about their mother and the things they do for them. It makes it seem like some commercial for a charity throughout, then by the end of it...Boom. Famous Footwear.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/ChannelAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/ChannelAwesome">Channel Awesome</a>, the Game Heroes put out an advert for t-shirts.

</li><li> Football fans watching the 2017 Superbowl were likely wondering WTF <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/OxhdrVP_L_8">this commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had to do with Victoria's Secret. (It's a commercial for lingerie where the models are playing football wearing feminine-looking jerseys. Possibly done as a joke for anyone who was expecting what they usually wore, but still has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with the product.)
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/k7VzWitgeU4">The Rise and Fall of Pete the Meat Puppet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is a song about a Meat Puppet brought to life and given a quest to "find that meaning of life". Along the way he ends up as a mascot for a fast food franchise and finds himself everywhere. He gets caught up with the fame and suffers a downward spiral. He eventually loses it all, leaving him nothing to do but continue his quest. That's all well and good, but what is it promoting? It was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.diesel.com/">Diesel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a clothing brand. How was the song relevant to clothes? Well, there's the line, "I was on TV screens, magazines, limousines, and designer jeans," and we see visualizations of all except the last, which showed Pete just singing instead.
</li><li> In Philadelphia, there's a series of highway billboards which are all black with white text which only say "I HATE STEVEN SINGER" without any other information. Turns out the advertisements are <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ihatestevensinger.com/">for<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a brand of jewelry called Steven Singer, which is "hated" because it's too great of a deal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17q51');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17q51" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17q51');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ihatestevensinger.com/why-hate-steven/ssj-contentpage-history.html?lang=en_US">specific story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> they give is that a man proposed to his wife with Steven Singer jewelry and later gave her another ring for their 20th anniversary, leading her to conceive a baby with him. He later proclaimed "I hate Steven Singer!" due to how the baby was keeping him up all night.</span></span>. Too bad most people don't know the brand and the signs can quite easily backfire by discouraging the people who do know it.
</li><li> Italian clothing manufacturer United Colors of Benetton has a well earned reputation for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.alistgator.com/top-ten-controversial-united-colors-of-benetton-ads/">advertisements meant to shock people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Often they also leave you scratching your head about what they have to do with the company's products. Examples include a poster ad consisting of head shots of real life death row inmates with the words "SENTENCED TO DEATH" over them. Another poster is a photograph of a just born baby with all the goop still on its skin and the umbilical attached.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ECTE6K6bCkI">This ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Japanese general store MUJI has plain white t-shirts floating in the air, with grassy hills, oceans, and cities in the background, set to calming music. MUJI and its tagline aren't shown until the last five seconds.
</li><li> The majority of the ads for the Brazilian shoe store Star's Chic. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN2trGfkP9w">They<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> show the store spokesperson in various nonsensical sitations, then offer screens for shoes, and finally the store logo. In that order.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/C0J95lddyWI">An ad for Jordache Jeans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> features a group of teens meeting an old man (presumably named Mike) at a park and having fun with him. However, this is interspersed with closeup shots of Mike seemingly in pain, with dramatic music and the voices of the panicked teens trying to figure out what they should do playing in the background. Besides the Jordache Basics logo appearing in both the beginning and end of the ad, not much else is done to link Jordache and the ad together, other than the tagline, "because life... is not."

The short film showed off Ma Bells <em>brand-new <strong>colored</strong></em> phones, which previously came in one color: black. The lead wishes for different looks for her home - and they appear. The point was "you can now color coordinate your phones with whatever your living space was", but even for the 50's, the point was subtle. Now, to modern eyes, it's just baffling.
</li><li> There was an ad for Microsoft where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> sees Bill Gates trying on shoes at a mall shoe store and goes in to help Gates pick out the shoes. When Gates buys them, he produces an ID which features his infamous 1977 mugshot for a traffic violation. They walk out of the mall, with Seinfeld asking Gates if Microsoft is working on edible computers. Cut to the Microsoft logo, end of commercial. It's selling <em>something</em> for Microsoft, but what exactly? It was actually pulled from television precisely because no one could figure out exactly what the advertised product was. <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/09/15">Penny Arcade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was quick to poke fun at this.

They know it involves cellphones. And Ozzy Osbourne. But they don't know what it's about anymore. (It's touting AT&amp;T's Samsung Jack.)
</li><li> In 1991, Russian company named Seldom ran <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Zafcl6KHeK8">this ad.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It has the name of the company fading in on a white background and an announcer saying the following words: "Once upon a time, there was a company named Seldom, and it decided to make an ad for itself. Not a simple one, but a <em>very</em> simple one. Like this. *<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a></em>* Seldom company". And <strong>that's it</strong>. No mention of what this company does, no contact information... Later commercials did establish Seldom as an electronics retailer, but this one could as well be a prime example of this trope.
</li><li> An honestly hilarious commercial where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg">Snoop Dogg</a> wanders around asking various celebrities if they've seen his missing bling, ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>...who, when Snoop leaves, takes the bling out with an evil little smirk to the camera.

</li><li> There was a commercial some time back with a little girl standing calmly in a field while a rhino charges at her. As the camera flips from girl to rhino and back, the message "Faith is not belief without proof, but trust without reservation" is displayed a word or two at a time. At the end, the rhino comes to a halt right in front of the girl, who reaches out to gently touch its horn. It was for a telecommunications company; now try and guess which one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> brought in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a> to direct a series of advertisements for the launch of the PlayStation 2 in Europe. They were surrealist black and white affairs about The Third Place, which is apparently an enigmatic land of play alongside people's work life and home life. There were many jokes about the other meaning of the slogan, but only amongst gamers  Sony had neglected to actually include the console, or any other gaming references, in the advertisement.
<ul><li> They repeated the mistake with the PlayStation 3, using a series of adverts styled in the manner of a glossy drama or soap opera set in a holiday resort, and ending with "This Is Living" and the URL "thisisliving.tv". Non-gamers (and gamers' spouses) thought it was an advertisement for Living TV<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3lb3h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3lb3h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3lb3h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later known as Sky Living, now rebranded into Sky Witness</span>, a UK satellite channel specialising in glossy dramas and soaps. They added a "PlayStation 3" flash at the tail end of the commercials' run, after the machine <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/2007/03/victory-in-europe-photographic.html">shuddered, uneventfully, into stores.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> And then there were the infamous North American launch ads, which featured such sights as an exploding Rubik's Cube and a sentient baby doll. Add a weak launch line-up and its infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">USD$599 price tag</a> and you have your reason why the PS3 "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">had no games</a>".
</li><li> There was one for the PS1 that merely showed blood cells shaped like the PlayStation buttons in a microscope. It never even made mention of the name of the product, either.
</li><li> There was another infamously bizarre ad for the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> called "Mental Wealth". It featured a Scottish woman whose head had been morphed using CGI going on a philosophical tangent that had nothing to do with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, and then laughing.
</li></ul></li><li> On the subject of consoles, there were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> pre-launch ads, which <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP9XNzvmPIw">simply showed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a rotating green sphere with various strange noises and non-sequitur dialog from unseen people; at the end of the ad the "X" symbol would open inside the sphere, with the Xbox name and web address fading in below. No indication of what an Xbox was or any affiliation with Microsoft; the ads for the initial launch titles were more straightforward, though.
<ul><li> The European launch didn't fare much better, as it featured the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brsI6z13Su8">Champagne<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ad (a woman giving birth to a baby which shoots out of a hospital window and rapidly grows old before crashing into a grave) which was banned from UK television after 136 complaints. Another launch ad, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9sZKcSJ2mo">Mosquito<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> featured graphic shots of mosquitoes sucking out human blood. Both ads just flash the console's logo and tell the viewers to play, without any other connection to the console or its games. While the third ad, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BmDaEZey0A">Ear Tennis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> actually features gameplay and the box art of some games, the beginning (two Chinese men playing table tennis using their stretched out ears as paddles) is just as mind-boggling.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evony">Evony</a></em>. Oh dear God, <em>Evony</em>. <em>Evony</em> is a clone of the old computer game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>, which is a classic 4X-style strategy game. It's run, in at best a legally grey manner, out of China. A few of their ads actually show what the gameplay looks like, but at least as many of them show pictures of hot models in their underwear (that the <em>Evony</em> people don't hold the copyrights for) and say things like "play discreetly in your browser". There are some in-between ones where the girls are at least dressed in medieval-type outfits (though that's only one of the many time periods covered), which tend to say things like "rescue the princess" (an element that doesn't exist in the actual game).
<ul><li> There's literally an ad that's <a class="urllink" href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2009/07/504x_evony-ad-6-thumb.jpg">just a picture of a woman's breasts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, with the name of the game in small plain text in the corner.
</li><li> As stated in <em>Evony's</em> page, the sad part is that a lot of similar browser-based games are now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">employing the same tactics</a>. Some of them aren't even trying to be subtle about it. A similar game, <em>Caesary</em>, had a CG-rendered woman in skimpy clothing with the tagline "One click for a ROMAN ORGY!", before changing it to the tamer "One click for a ROMAN EMPIRE!" some weeks later.
</li></ul></li><li> Optimum's commercials  apparently, all they're about are some girls singing the number to call and a dude rapping so fast you can't tell a word he's saying half the time. But it's mostly the number song that gets stuck in the head.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Pk7yqlTMvp8">A commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that took the proverb about "herding cats" to a literal level, by featuring a group of cowboys herding cats across a classic Western landscape, commenting on the hazards of the job, and noting how proud it made them when they did their job well. It was funny, well-acted and directed, with great effects to make you think you <em>were</em> looking at "ten thousand shorthairs". They even apparently got several cats to swim across a narrow river. The narrator says, at the end, "This is kind of like what we do..." Who remembers who "we" are or what it is "we" do? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(It's an ad for <em>EDS</em>, the computer/consulting company founded by Ross Perot.)</span>
<ul><li> They did it thrice, actually. Here's "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/2Z2_kKAe9y0">Running of the Squirrels<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/L2zqTYgcpfg">their third commercial.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> They're business consultants, or something along those lines. They aren't advertising on the Super Bowl to get viewers to use their services  their customers are corporations. No, they're advertising on the Super Bowl so they can say in their ads to their intended demographic that they can afford to advertise on the Super Bowl.
</li><li> Most of the dot-com ads during that Super Bowl, Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, are remembered for being this, such as the E-Trade, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebMD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebMD">Web MD</a>, and Pets.com ads. Most others tried to subvert it by quickly explaining their company in a voiceover or text, but that Super Bowl, as well as the entire Dot-Com Bubble is associated with this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Outpost.com ran three commercials over the Super Bowl about how they wanted people to remember their logo, so they were doing a particular stunt such as shooting a hamster through the O in their logo (they missed...several times), tattooing their logo on the foreheads on pre-schoolers, arranging a high-school band into the form of their logo, and then releasing the rabid wolverines. People recalling the commercial remember everything but who the logo was for.
</li><li> Old Zune ads. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/feVYDw9SZ2M">Get<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/yJNS7HK1AuA">30-second blip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/9W9S6PCyNnQ">some unrelated animation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/NWdThJS60B4">slap on the Zune logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/V8XhcZ68gnc">the last few seconds.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/rkB9OT2XVvA">This ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for television provider DirecTV. Ostensibly a commercial about getting the best while saving money — but all anyone really remembers is "OMG ADORABLE MINI-GIRAFFE <strong>WANT</strong>!"
</li><li> Something rather similar happened to the short-lived UK pay TV channel ONdigital (later ITVdigital), whose main claim to fame was the rather awesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">monkey</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">pronounced 'munkeh'</a> - who starred alongside comedian Johnny Vegas in the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/IHw_wOlBzGQ">advertising spots<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's been said that some people signed up with the service entirely to get the free monkey toy that came with the hardware. Monkey himself has outlived the service he was advertising by <em>over a decade</em>, and is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakawayAdvertisement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakawayAdvertisement">the face</a> of the far better-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">PG Tips teabags</a>.
</li><li> That commercial where there's a line of various technologies falling and smacking into one another; a car, phone, SPACE SHUTTLE... but when the last domino falls and hits the product they're touting, you just too busy thinking COOL to remember the name... It was a smartphone right?
</li><li> During the World Cup, there was one <strong>very popular</strong> Argentine ad to support the national soccer team <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Eyzk8I7iHwE">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It was a 2 minutes footage of very clumsy, out-of-shape and generally bad amateur soccer players, ending up with the slogan <em>"Do your best, for all of us that didn't make it"</em>. The ad was brilliant to say the least, since every Argentinian is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">considered to be a failed soccer wannabe</a>. It was fun, it was heart-warming, it combined perfectly with the urge of the World Cup, and it even included the precious <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/DDbNeb0otlY">''notti magiche''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The catch? It was a <em>cellphone</em> advertisement! (Not that anybody noticed.)
<ul><li> This is not uncommon. Another Argentine advertisement talked about a parody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">summer hit song</a> called <em>"I'll dig, dig my sunshade in your sand"</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4452o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4452o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4452o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Clavo que clavo la sombrilla</em></span> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/egEz3iDTPG0">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It listed the usual tropes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">summer hit songs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">trying to show how ridiculous they were</a> (<em>In summer, hits are more dangerous than the sun</em>), and motivating you to buy a cellphone with MP3 player. It back-fired. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">The song became immensely popular</a>, with every disco ever playing it over and over. In the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecisiveParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecisiveParody">it was a summer hit song on its own</a>, and nobody ever remembered the cellphones CTI was trying to sell.
</li></ul></li><li> The ad for the Android Razor looks like a trailer for a movie about a flying razor blade.
</li><li> In summer/fall 2010 the first ad for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MonsterHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MonsterHigh">Monster High</a> was all over channels like Nickelodeon. However, the ad featured a British voice introducing the viewer to the first six characters who were all shown animated and talking a bit about themselves. It told you to go to the website but it didn't explain what the website was like very well. And nowhere in the ad was there any evidence (unless the tiny Mattel logo at the very end counts) that Monster High is a doll line. This is a very, VERY rare example of a toy ad of all things doing this trope.
</li></ul><ul><li> And, of course, the classic: Apple's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a></em> commercial.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/QfxZQebVqzU">This commercial for<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UmJammerLammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UmJammerLammy">Um Jammer Lammy</a></em>. As one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> commenter said:
<div class="indent"> Uh, I thought that was lame. I mean You see a pool and a Car drive through it, Wouldn't you think that would be an ad for﻿ a racing game?
</div></li><li> <em>Three</em> launched an ad campaign (that was successful!) of a pony dancing and moonwalking around a field. It became a viral hit with the tagline "Silly stuff. It matters." Now, Three are most well known for being a mobile network provider, but are also an Internet Service Provider and had it not been for "Keep on internetting" at the end, one might've never guessed that it was for broadband as opposed to a mobile network.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/XP3cyRRAfX0">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a partial example, as it looks like an ad to encourage girls' interest in STEM subjects, but is actually an ad for Verizon...Verizon's foundation to encourage girls' interest in STEM, that is.
</li><li> The ad for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> featured creatures coming to life in a theater - in particular, the chandelier turned into a dragon - and being fought off by the orchestra, which has little to do with <em>Golden Sun</em> beyond using general fantasy elements. (The ad was ultimately for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> hardware itself, with the point of "take your games anywhere; such as to a classical concert!") The funny thing is, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em> later went out of its way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">recreate this scene</a>, including granting the party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">the chandelier dragon</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">summon</a>.
</li><li> In Spain, mobile phone company Airtel (merged into Vodafone in 2001) launched a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/0VIStKrCBHQ">Christmas campaign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1999 that consisted mainly of a kid calling a lot of people and repeating "Hi, it's Edu, merry Christmas." The ad became popular in Spain, but almost everyone who talks about it fails to remember which company it was for.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame">Mobile Phone Game</a> <em>Mafia City</em> may be one of the greatest cases of deceptive advertising this side of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evony">Evony</a></em>, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">gained notoriety</a> for its <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yke9BhP1uks&amp;feature=youtu.be">notoriously bizarre adverts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, showing the transformation from a "level 1 crook" to a "level 99 boss" through comical sketches (with some showing a man in a suit proclaiming "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">That's how mafia works</a>"), which paint the game as a sort of bizarre crime-themed MMO a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoOnline">Grand Theft Auto Online</a></em> and 3D graphics with a cartoony aesthetic not unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">In reality</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AonTII_y8BY">the game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is actually a crime-themed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClashRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClashRoyale">Clash Royale</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">clone</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">all</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions">the usual baggage</a> and sprite based with a more realistic style that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryFalseAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryFalseAdvertising">don't come close</a> to the zaniness promised.
</li><li> In 1999 there was a series of adverts (some more NSFW than others) for the web portal MSN. They were roughly 30-second clips showing bizarre situations, like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UFNCdhyjbA">a lonely worm getting cut in half so it can play ball with itself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note54tfu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note54tfu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note54tfu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which went on to become the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">My/Your Meat meme</a> that became heavily associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce">Vinesauce</a></span>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDTbqw5raw">an elderly woman being seduced by an alien with a muscular human body<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GggnaZFLIF0">a talking fox getting its revenge on a fox hunter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> followed by the tagline "Life's great" encouraging you to visit the website.
</li><li> Russian mobile operator Yota did a series of "placeholder" ads - silent TV spots with white text on blue background usually saying <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5z4oM7ZuQI">"Yota TV ad on ''channel name'' "<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Some variations included "Yota TV ad on <em>channel name</em> on Sunday" while airing on Sunday, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUxVvICtOVE">"Half-screen Yota TV ad"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsMmsI9-fPg">"Subliminal Yota TV ad" during Simpsons broadcast<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Not to mention "Yota ad on billboard near subway station", "Yota ad graffiti on building", you got the point. While some considered them funny and fresh, they don't really explain what Yota is (before turning into typical mobile operator with SIM cards it was a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX">WiMAX<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> internet service provider, you couldn't use it on your phone without purchasing a separate modem or buying a specific phone). Even if you assume everyone knows that by now, they don't explain why it's supposed to be better than competition (and one mobile operator has been doing "we don't spend a lot of money on our ads to give you cheaper service" shtick long before them, Tele 2). Ads were retired after two months.
</li><li> Netflix's "Netflix Is a Joke" ad campaign. The earlier ads in the campaign confused people more than the later ones, which featured celebrities and actually used the Netflix logo.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgBqnZ5XFB0">One Japanese 1984 ad for the Macintosh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had drawings of women with floating apples above their hands, which begin growing rapidly before covering the entire screen. Then, the ad suddenly cuts to Apple's logo being bitten on as a voiceover says, in English, "Personal Computer. Apple."
</li><li> For the 2020 Super Bowl, there were multiple ads for a company call Quibi. Mostly they were focused on trying to make 'a quibi' a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedMeme">Forced Meme</a>, as a way of saying 'a short time'. This is only vaguely related to what they actually did, which was a streaming service with scripted short form video series.

<ul><li> On the subject of Mountain Dew, there's also the infamous <em>"<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQcfK9EKfL4">Puppymonkeybaby<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>"!</em> The Super Bowl spot at least managed to show a can of the beverage, but it was completely overshadowed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">sheer bizarreness</a> of the mascot with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">head of a Pug, body and tail of a lemur, and feet of a baby</a> dancing jerkily, chanting its name, shaking a rattle, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">licking one of the human characters on the face</a>. After that performance, people can be forgiven for not recalling that the ad was in fact for a drink called Mountain Dew Kickstart. (The intended message was that the beverage is "three awesome things combined: Dew, juice, caffeine", but even this fails to connect to the product since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">regular Dew is caffeinated already</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> For a time in the late 1990s, Taco Bell advertised its stores with a talking chihuahua. Often, these ads didn't really mention tacos or Taco Bell until close to the end. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> that Taco Bell suddenly pulled the chihuahua ads because the dog died were eventually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/for-whom-the-taco-bell-tolls/">debunked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a></em>. The reason the ads were pulled was quite simple — the ads were cut because while they were massively popular, they simply didn't increase sales at Taco Bell restaurants. Same-store sales were down 6% during the second quarter of 2000; the chihuahua was retired in July 2000.
</li><li> Similarly, the California Raisins were <em>massively</em> popular, even having their own merchandise and <em>animated series</em>, but didn't increase sales of raisins.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks">Mel Brooks</a> did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> version of his 2,000-Year-Old Man for Ballantine Beer, creating the phrase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"There's a party in my mouth."</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note69wn4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note69wn4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note69wn4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> After sipping a beer he actually said, "My tongue just threw a party for my mouth!"</span> He received fan mail saying people loved the ads, but hated the beer, while many others assumed he was doing the original character and didn't get the brewery connection.
</li><li> An early-1990s commercial for a beer which had some beer-drinkers wanting to try something new, be it "Grandpa's Old Fuzzy Ale" or "Benedict Arnold Pittsburgh Lager". Most people probably won't remember the beer which was actually being promoted.
<ul><li> Australian beer ads are either a hilarious send-up of adverts in general or filled with Australian in-jokes and parodies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">stereotypes</a>, though these actually fit well with the Australian beer-drinking culture. One example: A melanoma-ridden alcoholic is involved in a racially-motivated attack.
</li><li> A couple of ads for Labatt's Blue in the late 1990s feature a large group of people coming together and a popular song (the first was a guy serenading his girlfriend with "Sweet Caroline" and people coming out of the woods to join in, and the second a smirking Village People gathering)...because "anything can happen out of the blue." Indeed.
</li><li> Guinness ads tend to come in two flavours  entertaining adverts that are clearly advertising beer, and <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">artistic adverts</a>. Where the line is tends to be a matter of debate, although the River of Life ones are probably the former and the current Domino Alley ones are probably the latter, but not as far into the latter as some of their ads have gotten in the past.
</li><li> On the other hand, a by now three decades old series of <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/2Zcs3s9-bLM">Dutch TV commercials for Grolsch beer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, showing craftsmen at work, all of them ending with the slogan "Vakmanschap is Meesterschap (Craftsmanship is Mastery)" has been so recognizable that nearly everyone old enough to have seen them still remembers them <strong>and what they were promoting</strong> even with just the opening bars of the signature tune.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/_LJOFtx9N30">commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about a cat who lived with a woman. During the night, he leaves and wanders around inside a nightclub. The cat returns to the woman's apartment for the punchline "Have you been out chasing the <strike><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">bats</a></strike> birds again?" At this point, the logo for Bacardi rum (the silhouette of a bat) is seen, mysteriously dangling from the cat's collar, and the commercial ends.
</li><li> Another British example. Back in the 1970s, there was a very popular series of adverts featuring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter, which always ended with the advertised drink being poured all over Joan. The catch? Everyone thought they were advertising Martini &amp; Rossi, when the ads were actually for a different but similar drink.
</li><li> Some Snickers commercials count, like Sir Snacksalot. It features the Snickers candy bar with "Sir Snacksalot" in the same font printed on it. You wouldn't know it's for Snickers unless you look at the candy bar that the guy is eating.
<ul><li> Snickers also has a weird campaign where the tagline is "you're not yourself when you're hungry, so grab a Snickers", but they only say that at the very last second. Until then, it's just some random celebrity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">Adam Westing</a> with some schlubs.
<ul><li> They then proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert it</a> in the Mexican versions of the ad by inserting the brand name into the dialogue and showing the chocolate interspliced with the rest of the commercial. It made the flow awkward and the dialogue unnatural, but it hammered the brand onto the customers' heads with so much success that "eat a Snickers" became a temporary catchphrase between young people when someone was being annoying. Then Snickers took it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even further</a> by launching Snickers chocolate bars with phrases like "You're being petty", "Hater", "Prissy" instead of the name.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This non-Japanese ad where two girls where getting saved from some mean guy and their gym coach by a Godzilla-sized rubber ducky, all done in Japanese. It was for Coca-Cola's Oasis beverage. Somehow, Rubber Duckzilla was meant to connect to the tagline "For people who don't like water". Their first ad with this tagline was about a girl and her Cactus boy lover eloping. Presumably the cactus boy is meant to not need a lot of water and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">so would for some reason prefer not to drink it</a> and the rubber duck...floats? On the whole, the eloping lovers and two Japanese girls with a hidden secret would've made better ads for gay rights.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/swDzAPvj6k8">Great American Soups<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ad, the most expensive TV ad ever at the time (featuring top-of-her-field tap dancer Ann Miller and a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber">Busby Berkeley Number</a>), was <em>hugely</em> popular and extremely effective at getting people to buy soup. Unfortunately, the ad didn't manage to impress the brand name on buyers; they bought the familiar Campbell's brand instead.
</li><li> Gatorade had an ad campaign that (presumably) parodied this. The entire video was grayscaled and had various people scroll past doing random hand motions. It ended by saying "What is G?", never once coming close to mentioning the product.
<ul><li> The ad campaign also featured a series of faces ending in the "G" logo with no mention of Gatorade. It wasn't until well into the campaign that they used the faces of recognizable athletes.
</li><li> This campaign was made in the middle of a major rebranding, and anyone vaguely familiar with the product would probably have <em>guessed</em> Gatorade, so this was likely done to raise interest and draw attention to the revamped packaging (with a new "G" logo) and a new focus (hardworking athletes, eventually tying into the subsequent "Win from Within" slogan and "Prime/Perform/Recover" schtick, plus the changed names).
</li></ul></li><li> There was a British campaign which featured surreal little vignettes, ending with a picture of a soft drink can and words like "Hypno", "Chas", "Legitima", "Appe", "Trauma", "Bap", and "Dogma". Turns out they were for a drink called..."Tizer". Get it?
</li><li> For years, Swedish grocery store chain ICA has run a series of sitcom ads that take place in an ICA store with a recurring cast of characters. While the commercials themselves are very popular, and the characters are familiar to most TV-watching Swedes, the viewers would be hard pressed to mention a single product that has been advertised. This is mostly due to the way the ads consist of comedy shorts that very rarely mention the products in the dialogue, simply zooming in on them and showing their price but simultaneously distracting the viewers with humoristic dialogue. This is somewhat excusable, since ICA's primary purpose is to get you into the store, rather than to buy the product featured in the ad. They don't much care whether you buy the bread that's on sale—although they'll include it, since a few people <em>will</em> notice—but rather whether you remember the name of the store and thus choose to go there to do your shopping.
</li><li> "WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!" It's easy to forget that this 1990s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> came from a Budweiser commercial because it overshadowed the presence of beer in the commercial.
</li><li> The Cadbury ads featuring a gorilla drumming to Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight"...in fact you wouldn't have realized Cadbury too quickly, sans the logo at the beginning and the purple background. Nevertheless, the ads were a huge hit and "In the Air Tonight" even re-entered the charts. Then they came back with the eyebrow dancing one...
</li><li> A series of ads for Starbucks began with a text screen explaining that the flavor and the emotions and ideas it is supposed to evoke, and compare it to something else that evokes those things, then they show someone talking at length about it. For example, the Italian Roast flavor, "like a classic scooter", was supposed to capture "the romance and spirit of the sweet life", and the commercial then focused on a woman talking about what she likes about scooters and why people are drawn them. The people shown in these segments do not mention Starbucks, Starbucks is not shown in their segments, even in the background, and except for the opening and closing text linking the ideas, the things they are doing have nothing to do with coffee.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reklampub.com/publicite-whisky-johnnie-walker-keep-walking-the-giant/">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Brazilian ad shows us how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">"the giant (Brazil) is no longer asleep"</a> and features special effects that seem to come straight from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> movie. It's an ad for <em>whisky</em>.
</li><li> An ad for V8 Fusion juice consists of a carrot looking at himself in the bathroom mirror, and a voice over describing a moisture cream made from banana extract, "so you can smell and taste like bananas", and going like your typical shaving commercial complete with a female character feeling his chin. Cut to another carrot watching it as a commercial on TV and mentioning he wants some of the product. Cue tag-line "all vegetables want to taste like fruit".
</li><li> The Cherry Coke ads in the late '90s, which showed teenagers doing various ridiculous things, followed by giant words flashing on the screen saying "Do something different."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Z8yW5cyXXRc">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> commercial is pretty clever for its use of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttered_cat_paradox">buttered cat paradox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but you wouldn't know it was a "Flying Horse" commercial unless you paid attention to the split-second shots near the end or stuck around for the brand card at the end.
</li><li> A few people are sitting around in a waiting room. Suddenly, a guy in a duck costume comes in, and starts playing Duck, Duck, Goose. Then, a guy in a goose costume walks in. The duck suddenly shouts "GOOSE!" and tackles said goose for the amusement of all. So, what were they selling? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Vitamin water.</span> The only chance you would know is if you heard the blurb at the start mentioning the product and the duck sampling it at the end shot.
</li><li> Coke Zero's <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ZTkNsxNs-Us">It's not your fault<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> commercial seems to advertise some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft-esque</a></em> MMO game far more than the beverage it wants you to buy.
</li><li> Carl's Jr/Hardee's is notorious for <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/XjCigJyu3lo">commercials that advertise their hamburgers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EroticEating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EroticEating">Erotic Eating</a>; the product is clearly visible, but isn't what most viewers focus on. Averted as of April 2017, in which the heads of CKE Enterprises admitted these commercials were not increasing sales and switched the focus to fictional CEO Carl Hardee Sr. and his egotistical college-age son, Carl Hardee Jr. These have a <em>lot</em> more focus on the foods being advertised than before: Each commercial is about how one Hardee or the other came up with the menu item, with the exception of their introductory commercial. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/uGm0VC_geLQ">That one in turn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades this trope</a> by explaining that Senior left Junior in charge of the company, who proceeded to make those commercials with the half-naked women and run it into the ground, requiring Senior to take the company back and steer it back to its intended purpose of selling hamburgers.
</li><li> A Thailand commercial shows a woman somehow increasing her bust size using her "love handles". What's the product? <em>Iced tea</em>. (This one is banned in the United States for obvious reasons)
</li><li> Kit-Kat used to love playing its obnoxious jingle over every commercial. For whatever reason, though, come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> they decided that the jingle had to go...but kept the melody. So now their commercials consists of people eating Kit-Kats (or doing Kit-Kat-related activities, like you do), all to the beat of the melody. The problem is that at this point there's a good chunk of the population that's never <em>heard</em> the original jingle, so the rhythmic crunching is foreign to them. To the uninitiated, the commercials end up becoming nothing more than a random series of images followed by the Kit-Kat logo tagged onto the end.
</li><li> In 2013 there was a great commercial for some art colle- oh wait, it was for <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/PpyRi6Wi0sU">Absolut Vodka<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Aside from a single blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot near the beginning, the vodka doesn't appear until the last 10 seconds of the minute-and-a-half commercial (and even then its easy to miss). Its particularly amusing since it really would make a great commercial for a prestigious art school, but as it stands it almost seems to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">"drink Absolut, and you'll have LSD-like hallucinations"</a>...
<ul><li> For even more fun, it seems to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">boosted the popularity of the musician</a> whose music appeared in the commercial more than the vodka itself. Great job, marketing department!
</li></ul></li><li> In the UK a series of TV ads appeared for months showing restaurant chefs waylaying home cooks and preventing them from cooking. The ad would finish with the slogan "DON'T COOK! JUST EAT!" (or slight variations). Turns out that they are a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.just-eat.co.uk/">website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that allows you to order takeaway dishes on-line from a variety of restaurants. Who knew?
</li><li> There's the infamous <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/1nu14L2myvE">"Wonder Boner"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. For the record, it's a device that (supposedly) makes it easier to remove bones from fish so that said fish are safer to eat. Of course, these days, people are too busy giggling at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a> name rather than remembering the actual product.
</li><li> In 2007, a Canadian gas station store chain called Mac's launched the appropriately-named "WTF?" campaign to promote its new Froster beverage of the same name. One ad begins with two lesbians in white pajamas lurking by a tree in a forest teasing each other before beginning to make out—before it turns out that the tree is actually the legs of a giant man who is watching them make out. The girls respond by throwing axes into the tree, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">while the tree-man begins to grunt in excitement and then leak out the drink in question</a>, to which the girls get cups out for and drink.
</li><li> In 1997, Sprite ran two spoof ads for a fake brand of soft drinks called "Jookie." The first poked fun at the extravagant claims advertisers make about the benefits of their product (if you drink Jookie, you'll suddenly be transported to the most awesome beach party EVER!!!). The second poked fun at the often useless mail order prizes advertisers use as bait for their products ("Jookie Junk"). The commercials made no mention of Sprite until its logo was shown in front of a black background at the end.
<ul><li> They did this one more time a year later with "Sun Fizz," this time spoofing the use of cartoons to attract consumers.
</li></ul></li><li> Every year around the Thanksgiving/Christmas timeframe, TVs are flooded with little vignettes of happy families being happy, usually involving food: eating meals with relatives, baking cookies, etc. At the very end of each, there's a brief mention of some grocery store.
</li><li> Want to sell a novelty glass shaped like a boot? <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/zuDtACzKGRs">Call it "Das Boot"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, get someone with a hilariously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent">fake german accent</a> to stuff various food and drinks in it while acting like every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> stereotype ever. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed Trope</a>, because at least most of the ad is about using the glass, and they had enough self-awareness to include a joke about how utterly ridiculous the whole thing was at the end.
</li><li> An ad for Lunchables Kabobbles TV lunches showed a jackalope and platypus calling each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">"mixed up"</a> to parallel the ability to "mix up" the food in the lunch. Soon the two animals appeared in commercials doing things like jazzercise, pottery, sneaking into a fancy restaurant, or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfgbMHXUUk">wrestling a luchador<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the only connection to the product is a bystander calling the situation "mixed up" while eating or giving the animals Lunchables.
</li><li> During the height of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaxHeadroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaxHeadroom">Max Headroom</a>'s popularity, the titular (fake-)CGI head was used in a Coca-Cola TV commercial in which Max angrily interrogates a can of Pepsi about its inferiority. Essentially, this was a Coca-Cola advertisement in which a can of <em>Pepsi</em> was given a lot of screen time. Naturally, lots of people watching the commercial thought it was for Pepsi, and lots of others thought it was promoting the <em>Max Headroom</em> TV show, far more than the people who correctly identified it as a Coca-Cola commercial.
</li><li> There was once a 1950's magazine ad showing a Del Monte ketchup bottle, with a surprised woman saying, "You mean a woman can open it?". Said ad is commonly used nowadays as a symbol of outdated advertising and casual sexism in the 1950's. However, the ad was actually advertising <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/in1acwo.jpg">Alcoa Aluminum's new bottle caps, not Del Monte.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li><li> K-Fee's mid-2000's ads. Peaceful setting followed by a sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a>. The only connection to the product is the tagline and the showing of the brand name at the end of each ad.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://vimeo.com/179330724">A Brazilian commercial became famous for this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It featured the life of a boy as he grew up, from being born in a bathtub, being breastfed (close up shot and all), to becoming a teen falling in love and then being cheated on (making him a rebellious teen in the process), to him finally becoming an adult and moving away from his parents and into a new home. Then towards the end, it's finally revealed what the ad was for... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subway sandwiches</span>. Most viewers on social media were completely taken off guard by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/HungryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/HungryDays">Hungry Days</a></em> is a series of animated Japanese ads for Cup Noodles, consisting of short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU">High School A.U.</a> pieces based on popular anime, with the ad often just tacked on at the end as if it were photoshopped over the actual art, or sometimes just showing one still frame of a character holding a Cup Noodle noodle cup.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheScarecrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheScarecrow">The Scarecrow</a></em> only reveals itself to be a Chipotle ad until the last few seconds. It otherwise seems like an animal welfare-themed short.

</li><li> The controversial <em>Ebaines?</em> commercial for Greek fast food chain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GoodysBurgerHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GoodysBurgerHouse">Goodys Burger House</a> spends almost all of its runtime at addressing social themes such as sexual obsession, homophobia, respect for the people with special needs, and bullying, with actual burgers making cameos at the beginning and the end of it.
</li><li> Crossed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyNewscast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyNewscast">Phony Newscast</a> for a 1994 example, when a now-defunct brand of Chinese alcohol, Sibuxiang (named for a nickname of the Père David's deer), claimed that a mythical beast with the same name as the brand, was going to attack the Northern Chinese city of Taiyuan. Many viewers panicked, believing it was a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyBroadcast">Emergency Broadcast</a>, failing to notice that the message had ended with the phrase, "Plotted by Jinxin advertising." Plans for later advertisements to launch a planned contest asking people to guess what the product was were halted when the Chinese government fined the advertising agency as a result.

<ul><li> As early as the 1960s, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ErgdUhZteqw">this commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the catchphrase "Mamma mia, atsa one spicy meatball!" was discontinued, not because it was offensive to people of Italian heritage, but because viewers couldn't remember exactly which Italian-food brand it was advertising  probably because it was actually advertising Alka Seltzer, an indigestion remedy!
</li><li> The original Claritin commercials involved bright, beautiful scenery and happy music. They were very uplifting and memorable, at least at the time...yet what they actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude">were selling</a> remained a mystery for some time.
</li><li> A case of <em>literally</em> being distracted by the shiny  there's a TV ad where animated pipe robots walk around in their city, and it's an ad for some medicine that fixes your "pipes".
<ul><li> The product in question is called vesicare and the product helps with bladder leakage.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of ads for feminine hygiene products used to be this way  usually a woman clad in a diaphanous gown walking along a beach somewhere trailing her feet in the water and letting the wind blow through her hair. At the end, there'd be a brief logo for Maxipad or whatever and some innocuous tagline like "Maxipad: just because". These days, what with the feminist movement and all, commercials for these products (and ED) are a bit more upfront about these things...to the point that the "U line by Kotex" campaign <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/FRf35wCmzWw">parodied the "old method"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <strong>hard</strong>.
<ul><li> One example of sanitary napkins... er... sanitized is a(n in)famous series of print ads from the late 1940s through the mid 1950s featured gorgeous paintings of glamorous women in fancy dress, with tagline "Modess. Because." The reader can be forgiven for asking, "Because <em>what</em>?" See many of the ads <a class="urllink" href="http://entertainment.webshots.com/album/573243335lfPnNU">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead. HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">It once had normal commercials</a> with people talking about it relieving their headaches, but they soon had to stop making claims about its headache-relieving properties  specifically, it having any at all, as the "active" ingredient is homeopathic {it's mostly wax}  to avoid legal trouble. Further ads had testimonials with various people saying things to the effect of "your commercial is so annoying, but you've got a great product." <em>Why</em> it's great, as always, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLawyersAdvisedThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLawyersAdvisedThisTrope">cannot be elaborated upon or else</a>. A whole line of products followed, all telling you that from the makers of HeadOn there is now whateverOn; apply <em>directly</em> to your X. None of them ever actually state that anything will happen if you do.)
</li><li> One Pantene commercial is about five minutes long and shows a story about a deaf Asian girl who wants to learn how to play the violin. Fighting past a girl bully and having her violin broken, she gets onstage at a concert and plays a song so well that it gets a standing ovation. <em>And the violin has been taped back together.</em> The Pantene logo and the caption "Shine" appear at the very end. Up until that point, the only hints this was a shampoo commercial were the many lingering shots of the girl's luscious black hair  you could easily mistake it for a music academy, or a school for the deaf, or even a movie trailer.
</li><li> Lunesta is a brand of prescription sleep aid. Their original commercials had people falling asleep, a beautiful, glowing luna moth flying around, and a voiceover telling you to talk to your doctor to learn more. Later commercials have the same moth flying in front of a black background, and the words "follow the wings." That's it. The words "Lunesta", "insomnia", or even "sleep" never appear.
<ul><li> Later Lunesta ads (in Canada, at least) have the luna moth tucking people in, with a voice-over talking about Lunesta's effects.
</li><li> Some US Lunesta commercials may be intentionally invoking this trope to mitigate disclosure laws. The ads feature a glowing moth flying around while a voice talks very fast about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude">all the horrible side-effects that can occur (you know, Death, Sudden Irreversible Brain Failure, that sort of thing)</a>. "Don't pay attention to what we're saying! Look at the pretty butterfly instead! Oh, and: Lunesta."
<ul><li> Under U.S. law, if the ad does not mention the name of the drug or say what the drug is intended to treat, the ad does not have to include the required disclaimer (listing side effects, warnings, etc.).
</li></ul></li><li> Their newest ad features numerous moths flying from houses at night, and then zooming out to show entire cities (and eventually, the entire continental U.S.) glowing in their green color. But the kicker? Aside from mentioning that its "brought to you by Sunovion" (the drug's manufacturer, a very unfamiliar name to those who <em>don't</em> use it), the ad contains no reference to sleep or even Lunesta <em>at all</em>, and instructs viewers to "join us" at <a class="urllink" href="http://projectluna.com/">projectluna.com<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, the expectation for this campaign is for its users to put the pieces together, as the site contains additional resources and services as a companion.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a series of commercials showing people scaling cliffs and overcoming other obstacles, with the last shot showing the word "Zyrtec" carved into stone or otherwise worked into the scenery. At the time (before you could just Google things like this) people genuinely wondered and debated what Zyrtec was. It was actually an allergy medicine.
</li><li> Some years ago a new drug was on the market. The ad featured shots of a nurse in a maternity ward, as she lovingly blanketed, diapered, fed, weighed, and cuddled various adorable babies, or brought them to their parents to do the same, as the announcer read a list of side effects and urged viewers to "ask your doctor if [blah] is right for you!" They do not mention what the drug is for; but you can guess it's a fertility drug, right? Wrong — it was for migraines.
</li><li> One ad had a very hyper middle-aged man on his way to work, to the tune of "Good Morning" from <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Musical/SinginInTheRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Musical/SinginInTheRain">Singin In The Rain</a>. He bounces down the footpath, past the white picket fence, past the postie and neighbours, hops down the hop skip and jump game, slam dunks a basketball, dances past Marios barbers shop, bounds up the stairs from the train, chases the pigeons, leap frogs the Journal newspaper, and cartwheels up to the front door of his office. At no time during this is any category of product mentioned (hint: they're selling medication). Only at the end is there a freeze-frame of the word <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Viagra</span>. You can probably guess the use for the product now, but this ad aired long before Google was a thing... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7PoQ7HLaq8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7PoQ7HLaq8<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Cialis also had an infamous ad campaign from about 2009-2011 which had a couple holding hands while in separate bathtubs without ever directly saying what Cialis does.
</li></ul></li><li> On that note, Levitra (another ED pill) had an ad where a guy throws a football at a tire and hits the edge a few times before ultimately throwing it straight through the middle. That's it, that's the visual representation you get. Comedian Russ Meneve joked that he once took Levitra for a pick-up football game because of the ad: "Long story short, I got tackled and my penis snapped in half."
</li><li> Some ads for a then-prescription only drug in the late 80s and early 90s talk about <a class="urllink" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ton_iXXKY">finding the right time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=sRZ7FxgGqkU">finding that special someone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or getting in and getting out. Turns out, theyre all for Rogaine. And then theres <a class="urllink" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m7dlqMySDEU">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Rogaine ad, which uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning">Circular Reasoning</a> at its finest: men have heard of Rogaine, men have heard of minoxidil, but men dont know that only Rogaine has minoxidil, and (at the time) only your doctor could prescribe Rogaine. No mention is given as to what its used for, but these ads <em>were</em> from before the FDA decided to relax drug advertising laws.

<ul><li> A decidedly NSFW example from Germany  hardware store chain Hornbach had commercials for wooden ceiling panels that showed a couple getting busy, with the man suddenly staring distractedly past the woman and up at the ceiling, mouthing his discontent with the panelling. Due to a hugely successful comedy act by Michael Mittermeier ("stop the ad, I want to see them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fucking</a> again"), the word "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Holzdeckenlamellen</a>" has become incredibly funny in the right circles...but nobody ever seems to remember what company the commercial was for in the first place. One could also mention that Hornbach has a history of either totally-out-of-the-way ads like this and so-straightforward-it's-totally-out-of-the-way as having <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blixa_Bargeld">Blixa Bargeld<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> just read the catalogue (in a dramatic fashion).

Good luck trying to figure that out without anyone telling you, though.

</li></ul></li><li> There was a wonderfully memorable commercial one Christmas for Lowe's, featuring a little kid stumbling down the stairs scrubbing his eyes and tells his dad that he can't sleep. Dad responds that he's just nervous about the big day, escorts him down the dark hallway, opens the door to show light just pouring out and a room bright as day from all the Christmas lights. Not one mention of Lowe's until the logo flashes up at the end.
</li><li> An advert for John Lewis. Nice concept, brilliantly executed (and they later posted a video showing how). Unfortunately, unless you already know what John Lewis is and what they sell, utterly useless because the advert tells you nothing about them other than they're somehow related to people and/or growing up (it looks like a life insurance advert; John Lewis is actually an upmarket home products store). And if you already knew about John Lewis, it does nothing but remind you that they exist.
<ul><li> Since then, John Lewis seem to <em>specialise</em> in this sort of advert. In 2012 they gave us <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lde2yg9fJLU">the story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of a couple who have a relationship despite the fact her half of the screen is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The Roaring '20s</a> and his is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.

These ads had a monologue which wouldn't be unlike programs being aired in those channels, with the exception of the product's name only being tacked on at the very end. As the main focus was on the monologues and not the products, this trope was bound to happen:

The voiceover promises that Whirlpool appliances are held to these high standards, but there's so much emphasis on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a> that they never show the product at all; they seem to be riding on "Buy our product or you hate America!"

<ul><li> One Dutch insurance company is famous for its advertisement catchphrase "Even Apeldoorn bellen" ("Just call Apeldoorn", Apeldoorn being the city in the Netherlands where their head office is); they've used the phrase for over a decade, but people tend to forget which company it is. Then again, there's only one insurance company with their head office in Apeldoorn so that's okay.
<ul><li> A second, less successful company coined the catchphrase "Foutje, bedankt!" ("Mistake, thanks!") which reached meme levels for a few months, except that nobody has an inkling who or what it was supposed to be advertising. This campaign was quickly dropped once the ad agency clued in.
</li><li> Yet another used the catchphrase "Gelukkig heb ik meer verstand van verzekeren (Luckily, I know more about insurance)". This was an insurance broker visiting people at work, then asking if he could try his hand at what they were doing (usually something very specific and involved), going ahead more or less without their acknowledgement, and pulling it off successfully. His closing line, as he hands back the tools, controls, car keys, whatever, is "Gelukkig heb ik meer verstand van verzekeren". Again, no-one remembers the insurance company.
</li></ul></li><li> The AFLAC duck, at the end of it you know that there's AFLAC and there are ducks...but at least ducks aren't acronyms. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7j6g5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7j6g5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7j6g5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(The acronym is for American Family Life Assurance Company.)</span>
<ul><li> AFLAC is getting a little better. "If you are hurt and can't work, it won't hurt to miss work."
</li><li> They always mentioned what they do (supplemental insurance), but most viewers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">don't take their focus off the duck</a>.
</li><li> One AFLAC commercial in Japan features a woman having a tea party with the duck and a cat. What this has to do with life insurance, we're not sure.
</li><li> Later AFLAC commercials also feature the "Major Medical" pigeon, but it's not entirely clear whether he's competing or cooperating with the duck, or really why he's there at all.
</li><li> The duck is cooperating with him, according to the people in the ad, but by the time the duck starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey">breakdancing</a> you can be forgiven for forgetting the message in your sudden desire to see the duck fed to an alligator.
</li><li> In 2019, the company even put out <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JQq0dmBnkQ">a commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">people know what AFLAC is, but not exactly what it does.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GEICO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GEICO">GEICO</a> commercials are no better. They have a gecko, a caveman, a wad of bills with googly-eyes glued to it, <strong>and</strong> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSerling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSerling">Rod Serling</a>-esque guy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">Just pick a mascot and stick with it, already</a>!
<ul><li> Geico's gotten a little better about this lately, but their ads still don't really have anything to do with car insurance. All most people can recite are "Geico can save you 15% or more on car insurance" with "Can GEICO really save you 15% or more on car insurance?" and then acting out various idioms and turns of phrase literally (for example, showing woodchucks chucking wood, having three people attempt to tango, etc).
</li><li> Geico's advertisements do succeed at the <em>crucial</em> thing  you'll always remember them as Geico, and that you could save 15% on car insurance by switching.

</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes, the little pig from one of the above commercials about idioms has been seen doing extreme sports like street luge and ziplining with no connection whatsoever to Geico till the end.
</li><li> Another later mascot — two guitar players asking 'how much people save' with something inane and stupid in the beginning. Such as 'Happier than a Witch in a Broom Factory'.
</li><li> Geico rolled out a line with the catch phrase "It's what you do," which also generally has no connection whatsoever to their insurance. One of these is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to the camels on the Hump Day commercial they did, which is unfortunately represented simply with a group of people harassing camels in a zoo by shouting the lines from that commercial at them.
</li></ul></li><li> State Farm's hands aren't completely clean here  to go by their 2010-2011 ad campaign, saying their slogan out loud will cause sensitive, rebellious, lantern-jawed guys to appear and sit on your car. There may be something in there about coverage or some shit, but who needs <em>that</em> when you can spawn chunkheads (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">Bob Barker</a>!) from thin air? Also, apparently, saying their slogan summons a State Farm agent from thin air so you can get anything you want — that has <em>nothing</em> to do with insurance coverage.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIfHtr55jbw">This ad from State Farm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has a robot man click on a "I'm not a robot" button before being denied access, making him shriek. This ad makes no sense unless you've seen their earlier ads, which had the robot man working for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct">Shoddy Knockoff Product</a> of State Farm, who uses real human agents instead.
</li></ul></li><li> The General's auto insurance commercials have a cartoon General and a silent penguin sidekick (and in later commercials, NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal). Most questions about The General concern why there's a penguin in these commercials.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/Progressive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/Progressive">Progressive</a> commercials usually avert this by having the characters explain the tools they offer in the ads, but there's a few that lean more towards being 30-second sketches that just briefly mention an insurance gimmick. For example, there's an ad where some stereotypical office characters discuss how generic they are, only briefly mentioning that they want Progressive's "Name Your Price" tool without explaining why.
<ul><li> With their commercials moving further and further out of the Progressive store setting, focusing more on characters like Flo's friends or that talking box, their ads are becoming less clear about exactly what they provide. They'll mention their "home and auto bundle" maybe once, and indicate that it'll save money, but they won't explain much further, making that phrase almost as meaningless to the audience as Geico's "15 minutes" slogan.
</li><li> The "sign" commercials just have a guy with a sign that says "Drivers who save with Progressive save over $750 on avg." and don't really explain anything other than that.
</li></ul></li><li> AllState:
<ul><li> A 2020 ad which is basically just people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy">Fanboying</a> over their spokesperson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisHaysbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisHaysbert">Dennis Haysbert</a> and saying to each other, "Look, it's Safe Drivers Save 40%!" Another, ad, released around the same time, is slightly better about it. In it, Haysbert and another actor are supposedly filming a scene for a western movie. Seeing a crashed car, the one actor comments "Looks like they picked the wrong getaway driver." Haysbert agrees that "They'll be paying for this for a long time." The other actor replies "They will. But with accident forgiveness, AllState won't raise your rates just because of an accident... even if it's your fault." The director then calls to cut and tells him that his line is "The desert never lies." He replies that he thought that's what he said and she tells him that he was talking about AllState and insurance. He then gestures at Haysbert to indicate he couldn't help it.
</li><li> There's another 2020 ad that shows a woman waking up in bed as upbeat music plays, and then she rolls out of bed, taking the bedding with her and proceeds to roll out of her house and down the street in an ever-increasing ball of stuff that she picks up as she rolls. The ad is for home insurance, but it looks more like some sort of ad for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em>.

</li><li> A series of ads made in the 1990s for Union Bank of Switzerland consisted entirely of mood-lit celebrities, including Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley, performing readings of classic poetry (including <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/s2xA4i257aY">"If" by Rudyard Kipling<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/krbX-9ugbI4">"Ozymandias" by Percy Shelley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with the name of the bank only briefly appearing in text at the beginning and end.

He is out on the street asking bystanders who invariably tend to know nothing about Giroblauw (De Postbank's payment product), and getting increasingly frustrated by the lack of positive responses; he's been told everyone in The Netherlands uses it or at least knows about it (quite true at the time, actually). Cleese: "Do you use Giroblauw? (say yes or I'll break your arm)". Person, taken aback: "No, but my wife does." Cleese, switching to female at person's side: "So, you use Giroblauw?". Female: "I'm not his wife, I'm his sister." There were longer versions running in movie theaters as well. Everyone old enough to have seen them remembers them, and as the product is repeatedly mentioned as part of the gag, it's impossible to forget.
</li><li> J.G. Wentworth's ads featured a catchy song with what they did, their name, and their phone number in the lyrics, neatly averting this.

</li><li> A radio ad for Quick Draw from New York Lottery focuses on people waiting in line to eat the "muffgel", a hybrid between a muffin and a bagel. The only connection to the lottery in the ad is that it's a better way to bring people together than waiting for the latest food trend.

But even if you don't understand the language you can figure the bank wasn't mentioned once during the story, not counting the last words of every ad being "World History. Bank Imperial". Ads were a tremendous success, many phrases from there (re-)entered Russian folklore, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sostav.ru/columns/mmfr20/parts/6/5/">they were named best Russian ad series since fall of Soviet Union (where ads first started to appear)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> The 2011 commercial for Utah politician Jon Huntsman's Presidential campaign, which consists solely of a motocross biker riding his motorcycle through a desert and an anecdote that Huntsman headed a rock band in the 1970s. The only thing that tells you it's a political ad is the "Paid for by Jon Huntsman" tag at the very end. Not long after, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> made fun of the commercial by creating an even more bizarre ad featuring senior citizens and house music.

Both ads run for several minutes but only mentions what they're for when his web site pops up at the end.
</li><li> Pete Hoekstra's infamous "Debbie Spend It Now" attack ad. Imagery of a stereotypical Chinese girl riding a bike along a rice paddy and her thanking a Michigan senator for supposedly making the American economy "weak" made some question what the ad even was about.
</li><li> Around the time of the 1988 presidential debates, Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' campaign ran a series of ads known as the "Handlers", featuring actors playing members of the campaign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">Vice-President George H.W.

<ul><li> There were billboards around New York that punned on food idioms, such as "Cool As A [picture of a cucumber]" or "Easy As [picture of a slice of pie]". That's the only thing on the billboard. They were selling <a class="urllink" href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/heres-colorful-cryptic-alternative-your-ad-here-signs-unsold-billboards-154969">ad spaces.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Earlier versions of the ads <em>did</em> prominently display the Van Wagner logo and number, clarifying that it was available billboard space.

The premise is of a house cat explaining various things to a new kitten, often misunderstanding them himself, e.g. believing the vacuum cleaner to be a monster. Friskies do appear and the cats enjoy it, but the brand name is never said aloud and the food is never the focus of the short, often just getting a passing mention. Several shorts don't even mention it at all.
</li><li> Around some US states, there are trucks that stop at bridges with the message: "Jesus Christ is lord, Not a swear word." Some people don't realize that they are for the Jesus Christ is Lord Travel Center, located at Amarillo, TX.
<ul><li> Interestingly enough, a trucking company run by a Sam Kholi has also adapted the slogan on their trucks, and has continued to do so after the Amarillo's travel center's closure. It's reasonable to say that any trucks with the message these days are for the trucking company and not for the travel center.

Most notably, the team of HBO's show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a></em> bought air time just to inform Trump of things he would need to know but doesn't seem to. Their ads are a parody of a catheter ad, but they don't sell anything; and while a few make more or less clear who their intended target is, the rest don't make it obvious.
</li><li> DirecTV's short-lived "Hannah Davis and Her Horse" ad campaign was about a Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue model riding a talking horse, and the only connections to DirecTV is them talking about it with the rest of the ads seemingly having nothing to do with their services outside of the offer screens and appearance of the company logo. It's no wonder the ads came and went quick.

</li><li> The John Lewis Christmas Ad is parodied in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JohnFinnemoresSouvenirProgramme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JohnFinnemoresSouvenirProgramme">John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme</a></em>, in which an advertising copywriter working for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">John Lewis-like</a> department store astounds everyone with the revolutionary idea of <em>actually talking about the things they sell</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em>: "Senior Day" features parodies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KitschyLocalCommercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KitschyLocalCommercial">Kitschy Local Commercials</a> for Memorial Day car dealership sales, with Senor Cardgage's "Senorial Day Tent Event Suprasale" and Bubs' "Bubsotathon". However, at no point does either commercial explicitly state what they're offering "vera low prices" and "huge savings" on.
</li><li> The commercials in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceASeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceASeason">annual specials</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a></em> tend to elicit this reaction from the Critic.
<ul><li> One example is the fast-paced and vague Transformers Pretenders ads in the 2011 special that leave him nearly speechless in how confusing they are.
</li><li> The commercial in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair">Dragon's Lair</a></em> review (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode">Sequel Episode</a> to the 2015 commercial special) for the <em>Dragon's Lair 2</em> kickstarter throws in Randy Savage and Segata Sanshiro (both of their ads were featured in that commercial special), but they quickly lose track of the product in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">being extreme.</a>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Savage:</strong> Whoo. We just blew up Africa!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Segata's subtitles:</strong> This Has Nothing To Do With What We're Advertising!!!
</div><ul><li> There's also the 2019 special's Charger Tron toy commercial (which seems to be a rip-off of the Transformers, ironically), where Critic is very confused about exactly what the product is but loves the jingle so much that he believes it could work with any scenario. He then plays a skit set to a parody of the Charger Tron jingle about a date with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> that leads with the stalker killing and burying her victim, which only mentions the Chargertron toy at the end.
</li></ul><div class="indent">This was an ad for Charger Tron. Sorry for the confusion.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Mr. Plow" has Homer commission an ad agency for a new commercial for his snowplow business. The commercial in question: In black and white, woman gazes into a snowglobe while giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanWail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanWail">One-Woman Wail</a>. Panning shot of the NYC skyline. Shirtless man strides into the room, lifts the snowglobe, and throws it, causing it to shatter. The dust clears where it landed, revealing a sign reading "MR. PLOW."
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa:</strong> Dad, was that your commercial?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> I don't know...
