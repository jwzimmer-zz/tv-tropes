Replacing parts of your uniquely balanced glandular/hormonal system with pumps might not do your personality any favors, either. Characters who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine">getting encased in a mobile life support coffin</a> usually suffer this not from having parts replaced, but being put in large, scary and clumsy or destructive bodies.
</p><p>This trope can be considered a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance">Competitive Balance</a> gone bad, as game designers originally used humanity loss to keep player cyborgs in line  without any drawbacks, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> worth his salt would load himself down with Kill-O-Matic 3000s slaved to his neural systems so he could kill with a thought while his brand new shiny titanium limbs ripped battleships in half.

<ul><li> In "The Man Who Bites His Tongue" episode of <em>AD Police Files</em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em>) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop">RoboCop</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> is just a brain and a mouth in a robot body. His body does not have a sense of touch and to compensate he is given stimulants. But he is also building up a tolerance to the drugs and the only thing he can do to stave off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness">sensory deprivation</a> completely is to bite his tongue.
</li><li> It was averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>. In one story, a terrorist organization <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">steals dogs and grafts their brains in mechanical, humanoid bodies</span> in order to create loyal and utterly obedient soldiers. However, in the prologue of the story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> argued as far as he was concerned, the soul or spirit of the being always endures, even it if is mechanized.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai">Afro Samurai</a></em> movie, Sio implies that this has happened to Kuma, saying that he's been repaired so many times, there's hardly any human left at all, just a mindless "samurai doll."
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He later proves her wrong, by giving up his life in defense of Afro during the battle with his clone/cyborg father (who might be another example of this trope).</span>
</li><li> In the series he's pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> after becoming a teddy-bear Vader <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> although this might be because he blames Afro for everything bad that happened to them</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em>, this ends up happening to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Inaho</span> after he uses the processor in his cybernetic eye too often; it gradually takes over more of his brain, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">temporarily takes him over entirely</span> towards the end. It's done very badly, and comes across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a>.
</li><li> Reversed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em>. Briarios, a cyborg the size of a small car, tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">calmer and more collected</a> than his unaugmented partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Deunan</a>. Artifically regulated hormones might be one factor, but he was the much calmer partner of the duo even long before he became a cyborg. However, he does worry that his increasing degree of mechanization puts a strain on their relationship. But the manga strongly implies that Deunan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual">does not mind</a>.
</li><li> As given away right in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyDifferentTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyDifferentTitle">international title</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> treats the Self as clearly separate from the body, which is merely a Shell. To the series' own definition, a "ghost" is a person's soul converted into digital data as a result of cyberization. At this point, it can technically be stolen away from you if a hacker is powerful enough to do so.
<ul><li> The movies (much less so the original manga) deal a lot more with the related issue of how much particularly military cyborgs become increasingly removed from everyday life and even ordinary people and living almost in a separate world. It usually falls to Togusa, who is the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamNormal">Normal</a> with any family, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech">remind the other cyborgs that their police work ultimately is supposed to protect the ordinary people of the country</a>.
</li><li> There's also the question, if a Ghost actually needs to inhabit a Shell at all. A question that Motoko Kusanagi and the Puppeteer both proved to be true in the manga. Motoko achieved a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">transcendence</a> in which she didn't need her body to exist anymore. She managed to exist in the internet and other realms far beyond the limits of human imagination or understanding. Her body still existed in the physical plane, but she didn't need it to be consciously active. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> lightly touched on this concept at the end of 2nd Gig, but it didn't go nearly as "deep" into the whole concept as the <em>Man-Machine Interface</em> manga did.
</li><li> Ultimately though, this trope is averted, as the great majority of the human race have cyberized themselves (even Togusa) because it has become the norm for human interaction. There are some minority affiliations like the Human Liberation Front who believe that this trope is what will happen when you do become cyberized, and these people still prefer to remain completely natural, but humanity as a whole has not changed very much as a result of everyone now being connected to the internet. Almost all religions, especially the major ones, actually embrace the idea because it allows their followers to unify together.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> Major doesn't wear too many concealing clothes. This is touched upon in the first season when the Major says that, basically, she doesn't really have a body. Her view of her own body is that it's a shell, a replaceable object, and she admits to having a hard time reconciling with that. In the movie, this is treated a bit more grimly: she says that her being full cyborg (save for some "real brain matter in that titanium skull of hers") makes her wonder if she's not 'real', but just a poor copy made up by cybernetics, who doesn't really have a Self at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>: Prof. Hayashi is willing to do pretty much anything for his dying daughter, including making talking toys, immortalizing her by converting her personality into data and transplanting it into a robot and <em>converting his own personality into data and transplanting it into a robot</em> in order to cope with the pain of finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring">seeing her die</a>. Unfortunately, the robot housing the professor's soul swallows it completely and turns into a cold murder machine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The professor gets to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself">die as himself</a> at the end though.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> calls this "Boomer Syndrome", comparing it to the eponymous androids that occasionally go on rampages when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">their brains roll snake-eyes</a>.

The entire plot is about girls who have been given cybernetic implants and turned into assassins. Entire episodes are devoted into exploring the is-it-a-machine-or-a-human-being problem. The girls' cybernetic implants, as well as the drugs and conditioning that they receive, are killing them while slowly destroying their minds and personalities.

<ul><li> Hank Henshaw, AKA Cyborg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, looks like a straight example, but it's a bit more complicated. Originally part of a pastiche of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Gone Horribly Wrong</a>, he was turned into an energy being/ghost that could possess machinery after his body decayed away. It wasn't until he was rejected by his wife and wandered around space for a while that he became a hardcore villain (and even more hardcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>). So, this is more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">his soul eating cybernetics</a>. He eventually found himself in a clique with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Anti-Monitor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Superboy Prime</a>, both of whom had every intention of destroying everything that existed, including him. It didn't stick, much to his regret.
</li><li> The Guardians of the Universe got tired of the little issues that kept popping up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> Corps, and decided to "improve" upon them by inventing the Alpha Lanterns, elite volunteers converted into cyborgs via Manhunter tech. The big problem was that the connection to the Book of Oa the conversion hardwired into the volunteers turned them into puppets. The Guardians were so happy they could get what they thought was a Lantern's flexibility with a Manhunter's zeal blinded them to the fact they were less than either due to their willpower being deadened by the programming. And that was before they were shown, <em>forcefully</em>, that they weren't the only ones who could control said puppets...
<ul><li> Then it got worse when Henshaw above found about the Alphas. He was tired of living, and realized the conversion process was similar to his own experience. So he decided to study them, commencing mass production to study the process, in hopes of eventually reversing his own state back to normal human.
</li><li> The Alphas are <em>nothing</em> compared to the Third Army, who take this tropes to apocalyptic extremes. Imagine the Alpha Lanterns, but turn them into horrifying, zombielike beings that exist only to kill or assimilate anything that feels emotion. Thats the Third Army.

There have been versions of the character where it was implied that Cyborg was a full machine using what was left of Victor, but had no soul or personality; but these versions were very much the exception. Played completely straight, however, with the case of Grid, Cyborg's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> in the Crime Syndicate. When he first appeared in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ForeverEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ForeverEvil">Forever Evil</a></em> storyline he co-opted Cyborg's body and it was teased that he, like the other Crime Syndicate members, was an evil alternate Vic. Later it was revealed that Grid was not only not an alternate Vic, but "he" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenHuman">never even human</a> at all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Circuit Breaker</a> from the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Marvel Transformers comics</a> is this. Originally a humble, loyal, and cheerful woman, after a raid by the Decepticons leaves her crippled, she has cybernetic circuitry implanted onto her skin to allow her to walk, fly, and manipulate electricity. She also becomes a violent sociopath with no regard for the Transformers' factions or the actions of any individual Transformer, blaming all of them for her current state and believing that the best course of action is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">She actually ends up helping the Decepticons more through her constant obsession with the violent destruction of all Transformers</a>, since the Decepticons take advantage of her predictable blind response and the Autobots are a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> in this instance. The point of whether her psychosis is stronger before or after she goes through with her cybernetic implants is up for debate.
<ul><li> The Nebulans who become Headmaster partners with Transformers go through a bit of this, as the binary-bonding process links their minds with those of their Cybertronian counterparts. When the peace-loving Galen bonded with Fortress Maximus, he turned into a cold and calculating warrior, while Zarak, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt Politician</a> who bonded with Scorponok, turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>. After Galen died and Spike Witwicky took his place as Fort Max's partner, he managed to avoid most of those issues due to his laser-guided focus on rescuing his brother Buster from the Decepticons. Once that was accomplished, though, he had to deal with the fact that he was sharing a mind with the giant Autobot.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em>, where one issue is dedicated to the concept of "foglets": humans that have turned themselves into clouds of nanomachines. When Channon's former boyfriend Ziang decides to join them, she thinks that this trope is in full effect and reacts like Ziang's going to kill himself. Spider, knowing better, gets them invited to Ziang's downloading. While Spider practically had to drag Channon there, she changes her mind when she meets Tico, who is charming, well-adjusted and unmistakably human.
<ul><li> Then played straight in another issue when Spider describes "mechanics": synthetic drugs that can be taken both by humans and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">AIs</a>. Both get high, and in the meantime the AI gets control of your DNA...and promptly starts turning bits of you mechanical.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Prime Sentinels are like this. While other types of Sentinels are stock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>, Primes are something of a cybernetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a>, as they are humans who have had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">Nanomachines</a> integrated into their bodies. When programming kicks in, they morph into armored beings with powerful weapons systems, and become, much like any other Sentinel, anti-mutant killing machines, with their former personalities seemingly deleted. This was confirmed when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> tried to use her personality absorption power on one, only to find there was nothing left for her to drain. (However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XMen2000sMembers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XMen2000sMembers">Karima Shapandar</a> was indeed cured, possibly because she was a prototype.)
</li><li> Donald Pierce and his Reavers play with the trope rather than playing it straight: Pierce is one of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborgs</a> in <em>X-Men</em>, and in early appearances had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie">Beta Test Baddie</a> attitude, considering himself only "half a man" because of his cybernetic enhancements, but even before becoming a cyborg he was a bitter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racist</a> and all-around terrible person; becoming a cyborg just gave Pierce the power to vent his rage on the mutants he hates so much. His subordinates, the Reavers, are similarly all some mixture of machine and man, but they're considerably saner than their boss, swinging between an elite mercenary unit and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
</li><li> This trope was initially subverted altogether with Garrison Kane aka Weapon X (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">that one</a>) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a></em>, who retained his heroic personality even after becoming a quadruple amputee and subsequently receiving four artificial limbs courtesy of the Weapon X program. He <em>did</em> acquire a rather heated grudge against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable">Cable</a>, but that's somewhat understandable seeing as how Cable abandoned him on a mission which led to his becoming a quadruple amputee in the first place. Later, after his original creators departed and he lost his initial purpose as a heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>, the trope was played horribly straight, going to work for the Neverland mutant concentration camp in what can only be described as pure unleaded Character Derailment.

When a scientist discovers a way to travel safely in space without undergoing this procedure, the assembly of Scanners, whose cannot become hot-blooded or otherwise feel emotions viscerally, vote to assassinate him. Meanwhile, the hero, who is temporarily "cranched" (able to feel normal sensations) is outraged, declares the others to be "zombies," and vows to save the scientist. Part of the moral of the story is that the cold logic of the head must be regulated by the body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unlike many examples of this trope, it turns out the severing process can be reversed, "restoring" the soul.</span>

<ul><li> The World Of Blake's massively cybernetically modified Manei Dominei soldiers are merciless killers, but that's more likely due to their indoctrination rather then a side-effect of their cybernetics.

<ul><li> Played... bent, by Clan Enhanced Imaging technology; it does not eat your soul, but will eventually result in crippling neuromuscular degeneration despite constant treatment, and arguably a lot of the hard-core Crusaders who would use it were pretty soulless anyways. The version used as a control system for protomechs carries with it no inherent penalties different from the usual one, but due to its use as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualUserInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualUserInterface">Unusual User Interface</a> with the protomech, in which the pilot essentially becomes the machine while it's active, it can result in a "God Complex" insanity.
</li><li> Though in the case of the psychological problems caused by EI technology the fluff mentions that social interaction, particularly with other members of their protomech unit, outside the cockpit can limit this. So apparently they only eat your soul if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">you're a loner.</a>
</li><li> Played with regarding Myomer implants, which act as electric powered muscles that can vastly augment one's strength and endurance.

However patients usually become dependent on pain killers afterwards and that in itself can lead to a host of issues.

<ul><li> In <em>Redemption Ark</em>, there is a description of the effects of a prosthetic body (plus a physics-altering energy field) on a Conjoiner villain: "Her thoughts shifted and coalesced with frightening speed, like clouds in a sped-up film. She flickered between moods she had never known before, terror and elation revealed as opposed facets of the same hidden emotion." However, it's less "Eats your soul", and more "making changes to the underlying machinery of cognition will result in you thinking in very, very unusual ways". The villain in question undergoes such extensive cybernetic replacement because she will not abandon the chase, and her personality afterwards is driven by the same basic motivations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiamondDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiamondDogs">Diamond Dogs</a></em>, the central characters are made more and more alien by cybernetic means, but again, becoming alien (or rather, able to <em>think</em> in a sufficiently alien way as to solve the increasingly lethal puzzles they are presented with) is what they set out to do in the first place, again arguing a continuity of personality despite the radical modification of form - up to a point, anyway. Unfortunately they recruited a cyberneticist whose dedication to his art is extreme, to say the least.

</li><li> In <em>To Hold Infinity</em> by John Meaney, the plexcores with which the inhabitants of Fulgor augment their brains don't eat your soul so much as change it into something rather inhuman.

This put him in the NonhuMan category; in that 'verse, bacta therapy is so effective that cyborgs are seen as weak and inferior. As a result of this, Teshik grew cold and distanced himself from his emotions. But his soul hadn't been eaten; a construction worker saved him on Endor, reawakening his true nature, and he fought on until his Star Destroyer was captured. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Then the New Republic executed him for atrocities he, the least evil Grand Admiral, never committed; his mechanical laughter at hearing his sentence is said to be the saddest thing those who witnessed it ever heard</a>.

<ul><li> In "Children of the Jedi", another character went through a similar process to save his life from an incurable disease. He later mentions that, apart from his hands, he has no real sense of touch. Also, all his memories have been converted to information. When remembering a picnic, he knows things like the color of the cloth, or what food they had, but it's just a text file, he can't visualize the memory. C-3P0 notes, though, that he can still do things no true droid can do, like make guesses, or eyeball measurements.
</li></ul></li><li> Force lightning isn't possible with cybernetic hands but other force powers may or may not be affected by replacements. Vader is much less agile than before his transformation but there is the question if it is because of a weaker connection with the force, the shoddy suit design or the limitations that went with producing the movies in the 80s.

The down side is that he <em>looks</em> like he's got no soul to a casual observer since he is now unable to use his facial muscles and has a blank mask of a face.

</li><li> Going into "Nanoshock" and becoming "Necrotech" is a very real danger in K.C. Alexander's <em>SINless</em> books. Every humans have an extensive amount of nanites and many will have further bionics, with cybernetics enthusiasts really pushing the boundaries. Unfortunately humans have a limited "tech threshold", after which the body can't handle all this energy-intensive hardware and shuts down. Plus even if are you well below the tech threshold, if the nanites in your body exhaust their energy supply then they will start to break down the host body for energy. This is going in to "Nanoshock" and if the person dies, the corpse becomes animated by the nanites and the resulting high-tech zombie becomes known as "Necrotech"

People who ingest A.L.I.E.'s computer chips have their brains rewired so that they no longer feel pain, whether physical or emotional. This includes erasing painful memories, to the point where people can't even remember the names of loved ones who have died. The inability to feel pain also seems to make them unable to care about the pain of others except in an abstract sense. However, instead of condemning cybernetics, A.L.I.E.'s creator simply developed A.L.I.E. 2.0, a cybernetic implant that enhances people's brains <em>without</em> taking away their humanity.

The only example of an advanced cyborg was Abel Horn, who was essentially turned into a half-mechanical zombie with little remaining of his original personality. There's also the curious and ambiguous case of an alien called Abbut, whose brain has been heavily cyberised to act as a living, telepathic recording device. On the surface he seems to have a cheerful, easy-going personality, but as far as telepathic mind reading can tell, he has no thoughts whatsoever — whether this is because the cybernetics disrupt the scan or because his "personality" is actually a some kind of recording is never explained.

<ul><li> The Cybermen are said to have lost their ability to feel emotion during their transformation, as a species, from biological entities to cyborgs, either deliberately or as a byproduct of their cybernetics (depending on who wrote the story). In the new series, which presents Cybermen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>, emotion-inhibiting firmware is used to prevent the forcefully Cyber-converted individuals from killing themselves upon realizing what they've become.

The process "decarbonized" him, removing any last trace of organic material in his body. He's a bio-mechanical cybernetic cadaver animated by protoblood that only looks the same as his previous living self. Even after he regains his memories and willpower he is still sadly unable to fully express emotions and cannot truly reciprocate Xev's love (no matter how much he may wish to do so).

After slowly dying, Kira tried to keep him alive by replacing his body with cybernetics. After half of his brain was replaced with a positronic matrix, the sudden change in sensation (which he describes as being like an echo of what he once felt) is enough for him to want to die instead of going further and Dr. Bashir, the attending physician, agreed with that sentiment. He remained himself throughout the procedure (though in increasing pain and disorientation), but Bashir admitted that the unprecedented last step needed to save his life, trying to replace the <em>other</em> half of his brain, not only was nigh impossible but, if it worked, wouldn't leave him as Bareil anymore.

To sum up, he theorizes that it's the loss of context, the subtle details about an experience and the events surrounding them that makes the experience memorable and familiar, that prevents people from accepting a robotic life or truly understanding and appreciating an event being told to them second-hand.

The other, however, manages to change history so that the mass-Cybernetics Eat Your Soul and the war that prompted it never happens.

<ul><li> Decisively averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em>. Your mind is software and can be "resleeved" into anything from another human form to an uplifted octopus or even a futuristic tank. If for some reason you want to keep your old body, you can still deck out it with an array of cybernetic and biological modifications, without any limitations whatsoever.
<ul><li> The closest thing being some temporary stress when re-sleeving (especially when the character remembers dying).
</li><li> However, the Jovian Junta firmly believes in this trope, the only starting morphs available to characters with the "Jovian" background are unmodified "Flats" and minimally modified "Splicers". Though they're more tolerant of cybernetic augmentation than genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> An option for cybernetics in <em>Atomik Cybertek</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace">Transhuman Space</a></em> makes the question of whether or not Cybernetics Eat Your Soul the central question of the game. Different factions debate (again and again) whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>, uplifted animals, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">bioroids</a> have souls at all. Ditto for modified humans and especially uploaded intelligences. Several factions, especially bio-chauvinists and some preservationists, believe that Cybernetics Eat Your Soul, while others like Christian Hyper-evolutionists think that enhancements are <em>necessary</em> to advancement.
<ul><li> There are no game mechanics to prove either side right, but depending on where you life, what you are or what enhancements you've received might limit your civil rights.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a> 2013</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2020</em>: The problem was that essentially primitive (i.e. mostly mechanical) implants like hydraulic legs or augmented arms decrease Humanity by 2d6 while coprocessors (essentially computers implanted into one's brain with optional false memories, capable of overriding cognitive and neurobiological functions) incur measly 1d6 decrease. No cyborgized firefighters and combat paramedics for you.
<ul><li> Made even worse for 'Borgs. Many full body conversions have a human brain as a plug-n-play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU">Wetware CPU</a>. They are like the Servitors of Warhammer 40K, but the brains can be put into another body. One conversion, the Dragoon, combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>. The cyberware and the drugs keep the thing (barely) controlled. It acts almost like a dumb robot. But your character can recover some humanity loss by moving into another body. Just now he/she has horrible nightmares and flashbacks from being was a 7 foot tall killing machine.
<ul><li> A major theme, especially for police characters, are full borgs who have gone psycho, running amok in their 500-pound metal bodies wreaking havok with heavy weaponry. The task of dealing with these nutjobs falls to a police force's C-SWAT (Cyber-SWAT) team who are often extensively cybered as well and use heavy gauss rifles and anti-vehicle weapons to take the psychotic borgs down. If they manage to catch the perp alive, he gets send straight to the clinic, gets his cyberware removed, and then spends a long time in a recovery ward (on top of serving prison time for his crimes, obviously).
</li></ul></li><li> The same sourcebook that added the above brain-in-a-jar bull-body cyborgs also gave a mechanic for regaining Humanity through <em>intense</em> long-term psychotherapy treatments.
</li><li> Some of the sourcebooks doubled down on the <em>punk</em> aspects while downplaying this trope — it is entirely possible to significantly cut down on humanity loss... by having the cybernetics be installed by skilled surgeons in a proper environment with the proper equipment, and following the operation up with therapy to help you adjust (a good chunk of the humanity loss is suggested to be simply body dysphoria). This is of course expensive and time-consuming enough that only the upper classes can rely on it, strengthening the divide between them and the rest of the society.
</li><li> Another less-mentally-taxing alternative is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">bioware and biotech</a>: augmentations that supliment and assist your body's natural processes instead of outright replacing them,(Usually. There are exception, but even those are organic istead of mechanical). Examples include: custom antibodies and nanosurgeons that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">supercharge your immune system</a>, nanobots that weave polymers through your bones and muscles to make them stronger, custom-grown replacement organs with bonus features (like an appendix that actually does something), and much more.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns">Fading Suns</a></em>: Mostly averted, as this trope only happens if you take the "Cybernut" disadvantage. Then again, the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> declares you soulless if more than 64% of your body has been replaced, but that's really <em>them</em> going nuts, not you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em> has two major ways to enhance yourself with cybertech:
<ul><li> "Arcanowave" implants are icky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> tech that are made of demons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>. Here, the danger is not so much losing your humanity in the typical cyberpunk sense the more you get cybered up, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">having bent magic sent into your system like a virus whenever you use it</a>. Use it too much, and you start mutating into something horrific and run the risk of becoming an abomination, one of those altered demons that the government of 2056 uses to fight its wars.
</li><li> Conversely, those who use hardware schticks are rather well-adjusted, averting the trope, though hardware schticks do have their own little drawbacks (mainly being bulky as hell and nigh-unconcealable, particularly if you get the whole package). The people who primarily use the stuff, the Jammers, run the gamut from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a> to batshit crazy people who just want to blow everything sky high, but that's mainly a personality thing and not an effect of the cybernetics.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Obsidian</em>: The <em>catatonia</em> option on steroids. To be fair, you can also lose Humanity for other horrible things, like binding demons or getting hit by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a> powers that reduce your Humanity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>: Getting cyberware (as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">bioware</a>) implanted drops your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Essence</a>, as your body has to readjust to parts of it no longer being 'your own'. In all editions, Essence loss stunts one's ability to do magic, and depending on editions other aspects (like your ability to fit in socially or emphatise with other people or alienation issues, as well as risk of a rare mental disorder called 'cyberpsychosis') will also start plaguing a low Essence character. Hitting 0 Essence is fatal, making overuse of cybertechnology a Very Bad Thing. Fortunately, once a piece of cyberware has been installed, the Essence loss means the body has 'coped' with the original loss and thus new 'ware can be installed in its place without further loss of Essence (unless the new piece costs additional Essence on top of the original), meaning replacements and upgrades aren't a one-way street to an early grave.
<ul><li> The setting also has what are known as "Cyberzombies", which is what happens when a cybered character hits 0 Essence but is kept alive through a combination of drugs and magic. Cyberzombies are in a permanent state of their remaining flesh rotting away as they suffer constant rejection of their implants, and what happens to their minds tends to be even worse.
</li><li> One chapter of the 3rd Edition sourcebook <em>Cybertechnology</em> has a heavily-cybered mercenary named Hatchetman tell his life story. He says killing was easier once he got cybereyes because it was like watching everything he did through a TV. After going through an extremely risky medical/magical procedure called "Cybermancy" that allows him to "cross the threshold" of his human body and mind, Hatchetman has more metal in him than pretty much any other street samurai and is only held back from terminal psychosis by various quirks programmed into his cybernetic brain.
<div class="indent"> I asked [the doctor] if I was going to stay alive. <br/>He said yes, as long as I remembered. <br/>Remembered what, I asked. <br/>Remembered that I was alive, he answered.
</div></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> mostly averts the trope. Although there are a few implants that cause humanity loss, those involve removing parts of your brain. The vast majority of cybernetics have few disadvantages, and the most overt and powerful ones simply add to one's Paradox. In WoD, cybernetics gain their balance because a skilled Mage can emulate them just as well with spells-since they're all magic in the end anyways. They also have another issue, that any skilled life mage can cause a body to reject them. Iteration X <em>seems</em> to be sliding into this trope, but it's their anti-humanist beliefs rather than their bodily enhancements that are doing that.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the Glass Walkers, a tribe of techno-shaman werewolves, had a faction known as the Cyber Dogs, dedicated to fighting the Wyrm by blending their war forms with cybernetics. Due to making the Weaver stronger, that... did not go so well.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em> fan supplement for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>, getting cybered is a sin against Obligation, as with all other transhumanist developments.
<ul><li> This is because Obligation represents the ability to empathize with normal humans as something other than raw material. The nature of Inspiration means a Genius <em>always</em> has wonderful, terrifying ideas like turning the entire human race into mechanical supermen or how cool it be to fly around as a biotech dragon; even small starts ("I'll just upgrade my arm!") can provide the necessary starting point to rationalize their way down a very slippery slope. You can have very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">nice, benevolent reasons for wanting to transform the human race</a>, kiddo, but you're still an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">Obligation 0 madman</a>.
<ul><li> It may be worth noting that the Obligation loss is a risk, not a guarantee. One <em>can</em> make it out of the process entirely unscathed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> also mostly averts this trope with the Alchemical Exalted; in 1st edition, only the most inhuman enhancements for Alchemicals (death tentacles, massive brain modification, spider legs) caused any degree of humanity loss. Even then, a low-humanity Alchemical isn't crazy, just cold and detached.
<ul><li> In 2nd ed, they get the justified version of the trope with Voidtech, Charms which draw on the metaphysical disease that's killing their god-world. An Alchemical who goes too far, accumulates too much Void-taint, soon descends into murderous psychopathy. There are also ways for Creation's Exalted to implant Voidtech, letting them join the fun.
<ul><li> Actually, Voidtech may qualify as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> of this trope. Normal Alchemical Exalted are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> androids who can be callous, but are almost never truly <em>evil</em>. The ones corrupted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Voidtech</a>, on the other hand, skew towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a>, which leads them straight into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's another justified 2nd ed version — Clarity. As an Alchemical's Essence rises, they run the risk of becoming more mechanical in mind as well as body, bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Straw Vulcan</a> behaviour. With that said, while most Alchemical Charms are cybernetic or mechanical in nature, the majority are not Exemplary and thus do not modify Clarity - those that do tend to concentrate on distancing the Exalt from humanity either physically (such as using Manifold Transhuman Implants to bolt on an extra pair of arms) or mentally (by, for example, harmonising with the inhuman mind of Autochthon to gain information). Meaning Cybernetics only Eat Your Soul if you deliberately choose to let them, and with the exception of the Weaving Engines, you can always have them removed to push yourself back to a more human mentality.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> treats this as a psychosomatic matter instead of a literal truth. Any loss of humanity is due to the individual 'Borg's feelings and reactions, and how they are usually <em>perceived</em> by the society around them, rather than an inherent drawback to cybernetics or bionics. This varies between regions and nations around the planet, largely influenced by the prevalence of cybernetics there. In North America, cyborgs are considered normal, if uncommon in places, and only spurned by mages and psychics because they interfere with the ability to use magic/psionics (there are exceptions). In Germany and Japan, cyborgs make up a sizable chunk of the nations' armed forces and are considered selfless heroes who have made sacrifices to serve their country. Russia has a unique environment where giant, bionic soldiers make up almost the entirety of the front-line troops for each of the factions fighting to gain control of the region. To be a cyborg in Russia is a mark of prestige and each faction has a signature style of cyborg, each considered Elite soldiers and revered as heroes.
<ul><li> Though it is true that each cybernetic implant lowers the power of mages and psychics, and destroys said abilities outright if extensive enough.
</li><li> In the technologically advanced sections of Japan, the natural abundance of <em>manga</em> and <em>anime</em> (see above, extrapolate for another hundred years) makes cyborgs even more socially acceptable and popular than just about elsewhere in the world. Some cyborgs can actually get paid as "consultants" for submitting their adventures for a popular anime series.
</li><li> One issue of the Rifter had the least popular cybernetics/bionics, using machine parts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">corpse parts</a>, for the Necro-tech OCC (a usually evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Techno-wizard</a> variant to create. These, being magical, returned the use of missing body parts without affecting the patients' magic or psionics in any way; but most such characters would rather go without the missing part than accept the implant!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition">Star Wars: Saga Edition</a></em>, cybernetic replacements reduce your Use the Force check. Earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast">Wizards of the Coast</a> <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs reduced the benefit from spending Force Points. In any case, within the rules this only really applies to Force Users; it's even possible to become a full cyborg hybrid like Grievous or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Durge</a> without becoming a bad guy, though you have to nearly die in order to do so.
<ul><li> The old West End Games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD6">Star Wars d6</a></em> RPG mechanic for this was <em>"More Machine Now Than Man"</em>, introduced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">sourcebook</a> <em>Galladinium's Fantastic Technology</em> and it increased the number of Dark Side points gained substantially when you had more cybernetic replacements and upgrades. Upgrades counted double for calculating how many cybernetic parts your character had, as opposed to replacements necessitated by injuries.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> Monster Manual supplements introduced "half-golems", which are about as close to cyborgs as a fantasy setting gets. Having limbs replaced with golem parts can restore function and increase strength, but requires a Will save, which gets more difficult as the number of replacements increase. Failure on the save represents the trapped elemental spirit gaining control of the whole body, and, though still trapped, it can now express its displeasure, transforming the victim into a full Construct and engendering a murderous hatred of the living.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> had grafts, whom depending on the type take various toll on the body. Almost always resulted in constitution loss. Some grafts, called symbiotes, are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> and will try to make you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> by constantly speaking suggestions to your mind.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> with a few exceptions: in a setting with technology, any character can get some "cybertech" implanted, and the only drawback is temporary Constitution damage every time an implantation is attempted, and in a more fantastic setting, lost limbs can be replaced by various prosthetics that range from a poor replacement to a direct upgrade, at no risk for the character. The only element that plays the trope straight is an archetype of the fighter class, the warmachine : becoming a warmachine involves replacing a large portion of the character's body with machinery, making them globally stronger and tougher but also permanently reducing one mental stat. Intelligence reduction means loss of memory and learning, Wisdom reduction means loss of sanity and general awareness, and Charisma reduction means loss of social skills and self-awareness.

Even so, some titan princeps end up fighting a losing battle to maintain their sanity before losing themselves in the god-machines they pilot.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkeleBot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkeleBot">Necrons</a> got hit by this when the C'tan convinced them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">upload themselves into undying metal bodies</a>. The millennia spent in stasis, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">the damage to their psyche sustained after heavy repairs</a>, has driven some Necrons insane, or reduced others to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shells</a>.

</li><li> Obliterators are Chaos Space Marines who have, through some dark ritual or daemonic virus, become fused to their armor. While this gives them access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterWeapon">Shapeshifter Weapons</a>, the once-cackling mad Marines become eerily silent and emotionless as Warp-tainted metal continues to spread through their bodies.

</li><li> Imperial Psykers also make use of a multitude of cybernetics just as normal humans do. There is even some specific cybernetics that only benefit psykers, such as 'Psychic Hoods' and 'Psy-Amplifiers'. In fact, one of the Gaunt's Ghosts novels features <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sergeant Agun Soric, a suspected psyker being revealed to have had his one remaining eye sewn shut and his ears REMOVED to make room for a cybernetic augmentation designed to improve his powers after being discovered by the Inquisition. Keep in mind that its the GOOD GUYS who do this to people</span>.
</li><li> Ferrus Manus, Primarch of the Iron Hands, believed that reliance on cybernetics weakened one's willpower and wanted to find a way to remove the living steel from his hands that gave his legion their name. Unfortunately, his marines didn't catch that and despise their flesh as weak, replacing it with cybernetics as they advance in the ranks.
</li><li> Averted with the Iron Warriors. While they do use a lot of cybernetics, and they are ruthless bastards, the lack of soul is more due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">decades of brutal and unrelenting siege warfare</a>; the cybernetics are just their way of pragmatically dealing with problems like "does not have legs" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">right hand has mutated into tentacle and cannot hold a boltgun</a>".
</li><li> Averted with Ork cybernetics. No matter how much metal you nail onto an Ork, that inner core of violent insanity remains clearly visible - it's just now directing a larger and tougher body.
</li><li> The Butcher's Nails are a horrific and <em>intentional</em> example. A truly ghastly piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">archaeotech</a>, the Butcher's Nails are cybernetic cortical implants that are <em>drilled into a person's skull, removing parts of their brain</em>. The Nails increase strength and aggression by manipulating their victims' brain chemistry while also having the effect of making them unable to enjoy anything except fighting and killing. Even worse, the Nails slowly degrade the person's brain, slowly killing them. And they can't be removed without killing the host either since the Nails also function as a replacement for the parts of the brain that were removed in the process of implanting them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em>:
<ul><li> A literal take on this trope are the Obliviates, who are cyborgs implanted with a device called an "Oblivion Volitor", a Heretek device that actually destroys the soul, turning the unfortunate into a zombie-like creature.
</li><li> According to the adventure Light of Reason, the Adeptus Mechanicus's practice of replacing parts of their brain with cybernetics erodes their immortal souls. In the case of the extremist faction called The Brotherhood of Steel this makes their members unable to feel the danger of the wrap phenomena, even when these fills all others with dread, but it also give them some protection against being directly subjugated by the powers of Chaos.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda">Necromunda</a></em>, this trope is averted by the majority of Pit Slaves who have retained their humanity despite the great number of bionic replacements that have been forced upon them. Servitors, lobotomised and programmed cyborgs that have to be programmed to perform tasks, are the only members of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">Pit Slave gang</a> who have had their humanity striped from them by the cyberization process.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Alternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Alternity">Alternity</a></em> uses Cybertech that is mostly safe, baring the chance of rejection, which one species doesn't have. There is a limit on how much cybertech you can have, and two products come with a built in risk of Cykosis, notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Fast Chip</a>. Cybertolerance determines how much cybertech you can handle before rejection is automatic, and there are ways you can increase your tolerance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a>: Hell on Earth</em>, a distinction is made between cyborgs (undead with cybernetic parts) and scrappers (living humans with cybernetic parts). While cyborgs suffer no ill effect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because the power for their cybernetics comes from the soul of a demon spiritually shackled to their heads</span>, scrappers have their Spirit die type reduced (or their total dice if they're already at d4) when they replace major body parts. This is because they power their devices with their soul: battery-powered devices are available, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">expensive</a>; and in a pinch non-vital systems can be turned off to increase their dice again. This is all well and good, fair and balanced, except for one thing: the Spirit die type is used primarily for magic rolls, faith rolls, and <em>guts rolls</em>. Apparently having your super-powered buzzsaw arm running makes you more likely to run away?
<ul><li> Its also worth noting that Cyborgs are actually more mentally stable than normal Harrowed as their manitou are chained up in the basement next to the boiler not running around the bedroom with a knife. What makes cyborgs crazy is their asshole onboard AI's that have arbitrary rules of engagement that they force the cyborg to follow. With no AI or an AI with no idiot rules cyborgs are more sane than normal people... because armor 8 means you can face down anything in the waste and laugh.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> tabletop RPG has a mechanic for this trope which is derived from Cyberpunk's. However, there are mild subversions. First of all, it is explicitly stated once in the writeup of the Humanity stat that cybernetics are not the only way to lose Humanity. Second, counseling can help out quite a bit. Other than this and a certain lack of explicit psychic or magical loss, both being foreign to the setting, the trope is played straight, especially since counseling is only guaranteed to succeed if the patient has removed all cybernetics.
</li><li> Yawgmoth, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the entire Dominarian Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, was obsessed with the mechanics of the body. He lords over the evil machine plane of Phyrexia, where he and his followers used its mechanical wonders to improve ("compleat") their bodies, at the cost of their own humanity. In the mechanics of the game, artifact creatures (usually machines) are generally unaffected by black spells that destroy creatures.
<ul><li> See also Esper, part of the Shards of Alara block. Every creature in Esper has some amount of aether-infused metal grafted onto their body. This is okay unless they replace their whole body, after which they become twisted fiends called aether-liches.
</li><li> Phyrexia's worse. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/137">Much worse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> Averted on Kaladesh. Aetherborn, who have very short lives, often use technology to upgrade themselves in an attempt to extend their lives, but this is actually the morally superior option compared to the other main way aetherborn can extend their lives - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">draining life energy from other beings</a>.
</li><li> Also averted in the joke set of <em>Unstable</em>, where the Order of the Widget engage in heavy, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=439391">often faintly ridiculous<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> cyborging procedures (yes, that's a toaster), and are one of the least evil groups in-setting. (Mind you, the other groups in the setting consist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad biologists</a> who make themselves into bizarre multi-species aberrations, explosion-obsessed goblins, deeply inept spies and saboteurs, and a group of literal supervillains calling themselves the League of Dastardly Doom).
</li></ul></li><li> Averted with the Therians, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AT43" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AT43">AT-43</a></em>. Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the setting, they are not very warlike or evil (in fact, they have long ago forgotten how to fight, making them rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat">MMORPGS for tactics</a>). They just don't seem to get why the other races keep shooting up them for trying to blow up their solar systems in order to make Dyson Spheres in order to save the universe form dying of old age...in 25 billion years. So its more like Cybernetics makes you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a>. (Except for their Warrior Guild, who <em>all</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a>.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a>'s Guide to Gaming</em> encourages exploiting this mechanic as its a free power up coupled with a roleplaying justification <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HackAndSlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HackAndSlash">for your normal behavior.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AllFleshMustBeEaten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AllFleshMustBeEaten">All Flesh Must Be Eaten</a></em> provides rules for Essence loss from cybernetics and "cyberpsychosis" in its <em>All Tomorrow's Zombies</em> supplement... but made it clear they were optional for two reasons. One was that such rules went against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a> that AFMBE embraces (who has time for moral dilemmas when there are undead to kill?!?); the other is that when there are undead wandering around, the question of where the line between humanity and inhumanity lies is already pretty much answered, so it's not exactly relevant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkFuture">Dark Future</a></em> supplement <em>Dead Mans Curve</em> introduced rules for cybernetics and for psychosis caused by the stress and trauma of the life of Renegades and Ops. Cybernetics increased your base level of pyschosis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewHorizon">New Horizon</a></em> The anti-rejection drugs are stated to have a side effect where the user can become easily both depressed and easily agitated as well as suffer from advanced aging. More likely though, the social rejection from society, the cost of medical bills, and the interactions of the anti-rejection drugs with alcohol and other drugs used by cyborgs to deal with emotional pain lead to most of the problems with useing cybernetics, not the cybernetics themselves.
</li><li> The White Wolf D20 setting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonMech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonMech">DragonMech</a></em> has a character class dedicated to installing steam-powered prosthetics, which has an ability called "Lose Self" forcing them to pass a Charisma check or spend a day as an emotionless robot.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> with one major exception. Cybernetics that directly mess with a person's brain, such as various enhanced neural interfaces, <em>are</em> decidedly bad for their health and sanity (this is one reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">ProtoMech</a> pilots have a life expectancy of at best about a decade even if they don't get killed in battle), but most other implants are fairly safe — though except for the Word of Blake's Manei Domini cyborgs (who tended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> before they started going chrome), they also tend not to provide much in the way of superhuman abilities other than the occasional hidden weapon in a prosthetic limb or the like.
</li><li> In the mecha RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GiantGuardianGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GiantGuardianGeneration">Giant Guardian Generation</a></em>, being a Cyborg means you take a penalty to Empathy rolls, as well as Awareness rolls that involve diplomacy and deceit. In other words, Cybernetics don't so much Eat Your Soul as Make You Bad at Socializing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WolsungSteamPulpFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WolsungSteamPulpFantasy">Wolsung Steam Pulp Fantasy</a></em> has the Uhrwerk, insane dwarves who replaced their bodies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> cybernetics.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> cards "<a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Giga_Gagagigo">Giga Gagagigo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" and "<a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gogiga_Gagagigo">Gogiga Gagagigo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" show the character <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagagigo">Gagagigo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after being cybernetically reconstructed. The flavor text on the first mentions that the cybernetics caused him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">lose</a> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">heart and redemption</a>, and the second's says that his soul has long since collapsed, and that his body continues recklessly in a quest for more power.
<ul><li> Even more Gagagigo is the evolved form of <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gigobyte">Gigobyte<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a very cute mon.
</li><li> Eventually Subverted with "Gagagigo The Risen" who's Gogiga Gagagigo after being redeemed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones">Hc Svnt Dracones</a></em> cybernetic augmentation itself doesn't have any penalties, though there's a limit to how many implants one can get based on their Body and Mind traits. However one can exceed that limit by using Vitae, a substance that oxygenates tissue without proper circulation and speeds regeneration, but it can't completely replace blood and cerebrospinal fluid for the brain so it begins to atrophy and go nuts, turning into a "<a class="urllink" href="http://hcsvntdracones-game.tumblr.com/post/104000215878/tti-and-progenitus-are-one-of-the-few-corporate">Vitae Demon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". There are also a few specific implants that affect the mind, a Behavioral Adjuster changes the character's Motivation, with or against their will depending on who controls the implant; a Voice literally gives you a voice in your head, though usually it's helpful; and the Aestus Leech really lowers its host's inhibitions and has a bit of a will of its own, if a character has both a Voice and a Leech they tend to conflict.
<ul><li> Most forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">Bio-Augmentation</a>, on the other hand, have no disadvantages or limits aside from the monetary cost, though Augmentation that adds limbs or something has a hard limit of two and Genetic Reclamation has a limit of 3 (though each species has only 4 Reclamations available).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld">Bleak World</a></em> has it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope">Zigzagged</a> with the Cyborg class of the Alien Race and the Android class of the Experiment Race. The Cyborgs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">aliens, so were likely going to be evil anyway</a>. The Androids on the other hand are dead teenagers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie">brought back to life with technology</a>, and are described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">the most psychotic of the experiment classes</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">However, there is no rule or mechanic making the Android worse than another experiment.</a> In fact they have the 3rd lowest humanity cap to remain in disguise.
</li><li> In the <em>Toonpunk 2020 1/2</em> setting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon">Toon</a></em>, cybernetic enhancements can lead to a character "Looning Out" after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake">Boggled</a>, which means the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Animator</a> takes control of him for three turns, and probably has him commit slapstick violence. Less serious than other examples, obviously, because it's <em>Toon</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern">d20 Modern</a></em> ignores this by default - your Constitution score limits how many cybernetics you can take because healthier people can handle it better. Going over the limit inflicts negative levels, but that's to represent the excessive cybernetics compromising your health. There is an optional "piece of your soul" rule in the <em>Cyberscape</em> book, but the cost is a relatively minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoint">Experience Point</a> expenditure instead of some kind of permanent "damage" to your soul.

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>: the cybernetics have been replaced by the much more visceral "plasmids," and given that they're an offshoot of a highly unstable gene-modifying substance, the dehumanizing power of the stuff is justified. Overuse of Plasmids, Gene Tonics and other ADAM-based products causes addiction, gross deformity, and insanity; as such, the first people in Rapture to succumb and transform into splicers were people who'd overused its cosmetic variants, and the rest did so in an attempt to defend themselves against the Splicers- to quote one of the recordings: "There's an arms race on here in Rapture. It's about who can become less of a man and more of a monster." That said, there <em>are</em> people who can maintain their humanity in spite of their modifications: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the protagonists of both games, for example.</span> That and the Big Daddies; most of them used to be criminals that were sent in for "testing."
</li><li> In the 90's cyberpunk game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodnet">BloodNet</a></em>, the main character and streetgangs frequently argue about whether cybernetic implants destroy or enhance the user's humanity. A number of characters have had their brains fried by a combination of designer drugs and cybernetic implants - it is set in the futuristic New York ghettos and the modifications are typically illegal and unmoderated - but a cybernetic implant is helping to prevent the main character becoming a vampire and others are being used to cure a variety of mental illnesses. So, it's a combination of this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>.

According to Angel, he was born with a deficiency that required him to get cybernetic implants at an early age which led to a full-on addiction to augmentation and that Jack would risk turning him more machine than man by hiring him (something that he considers completely awesome). Wilhelm for his part is completely unconcerned.

</li><li> Amber of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectEden">Project Eden</a></em> is said to have become increasingly withdrawn and machine like as the years go by.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV">Quake IV</a></em> cybernetics on their own don't eat your soul, but activation of the Neurocyte takes control of the former human body and the person inside degrades into nothing.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe">Remember Me</a></em>, practically everyone has Memorise implants installed that allow them to control their memories (but also let others, like the protagonist Nilin, edit them). The people whose memory implants malfunction completely not only lose their minds and go insane, but outright turn into Leapers, (probably a result of the implant-addled brain sending new and unneeded growth signals). Whatever the cause, even the basic Prowler Leapers gain superhuman speed, strength and agility, easily running on walls. Tougher Skinner Leapers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mooks</a> buffed by the presence of other Leapers, while Strangler Leapers are somewhat weaker, but can turn invisible unless the lightning is too bright.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld">Rimworld</a></em>, characters with the Prostophobe/Body Purist trait seem to believe this.

Inverted in turn by Transhumanist characters, who feel more and more <em>alive</em> with each piece of their bodies replaced with superior technology, boosting their moods for each bit. Played straight with Luciferium, a drug which turns a colonist into a host for highly advanced glitterworld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">mechanites</a> which give them a ridiculous number of health benefits - immunity to disease, enhanced bodily functions across the board, regeneration of any injury <em>including brain damage</em>... at the cost of them being forever dependent on weekly Luciferium doses, and if they can't get their fix they go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and then die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> video games:
<ul><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">SNES</a> game, where installing cyberware has no cost to the soul. The main character Jake eventually becomes a Dog Shaman every bit as powerful as Fujiko Kano, one of the premier spellcasters in the <em>Shadowrun</em> universe, despite being loaded down with dermal armor, wired reflexes, and other invasive pieces of cyberware. It's possibly justified, depending on the edition rules you're going by, as the Dog Spirit takes it upon himself to impose a few hefty Geasa on Jake to make up for his disconnect from the spiritual world, which could potentially send his Essence up to levels where the Cyberware isn't an issue.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Genesis</a> version follows a simplified version of the table-top source material. Less Essence means less magic, but the game won't let you kill yourself by installing too much. You need to have the Essence to pay for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowrunReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowrunReturns">Shadowrun Returns</a></em> also uses a simpler version of the original, where you can't install more cyberware than you can afford in Essence. NPCs in a campaign might react to you having implants, but the player is never forced to act in a particular way.
<ul><li> The <em>Dragonfall</em> DLC has a character actually use this intentionally: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Glory had tied her soul to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">The Horned God</a> and used extensive and, from an Essence point of view, deliberately old and inefficient cybernetic implants to shred her Essence for the purpose of severing the connection when she turned from him, which makes it in some sense, an inversion - by severing her connection with the toxic spirit, which was doing far more to "eat her soul" in the sense of this trope than any amount of cyberware, she was reclaiming her humanity, rather than destroying it</span>.
</li><li> In her personal quest, Glory can potentially reference this trope in dialog, commenting that she rarely feels emotions anymore - most of the time, she's just numb.
</li><li> <em>Dragonfall</em> also features <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The MKVI, a cyberzombie with -2 Essence. After repeated rounds of cyberisation, compounded by a experimental drug allowing it to have more implants than normally possible, it is essentially a mindless killing machine devoid of humanity and its soul is trapped inside its body in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> scenario. If you disable its control overrides and restore its mind it immediately kills itself, pausing only just long enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">to thank you.</a></span>
</li><li> The <em>Hong Kong</em> campaign discusses this trope with two characters: Ten-Armed Ambrose had most of his body replaced by cybernetics to save his life and now runs a Street Doc clinic using machinery he's more or less permanently rigged into. He's on the verge of crossing the threshold and engages in a lot of social activity to keep his humanity in check. Meanwhile, Racter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism">Transhumanist</a> who has made it his life's mission to study the Essence Limit and is of the firm belief that it can be overcome, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a belief anchored in his own body being cybernetic from the waist down and having been implanted with some extremely experimental and volatile mind-affecting implants without them affecting him mentally. Racter attributes his mental stability to the fact that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">clinical sociopath</a>, and thus also believes that <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralSociopath">people like him</a> are the key to transhumanism.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, <em>Alien Crossfire</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Cybernetic Consciousness</a> faction suffers from slower reproductive rates, since its followers no longer "get" the ideas of love or sex. In addition, the "Cybernetic" future plans cause your workers to be replaced by machines, which in turn leads to higher social unrest. (This can apparently be averted if you occupy said workers with managing the Planet's Internet—provided your faction was the one that built the network backbone.) Among the faction leaders, Pravin Lal seems to believe this, going by some of his quotes. While one merely concerns unscrupulous use of (forcibly) cybered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> (almost certainly referring to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState">Human</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill">Hive</a>), the other relates how, during his usual interfacing with life support machinery, he found his thoughts, which crossed over into it as usual, being <em>answered</em> by the machine itself with cold and rigid thoughts of its own.

It also features an encounter with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a man who's been looking for his lost daughter over the course of the game. The lower your humanity score, the more hideous his augmentations</span>. The enemy "Cybers" are just mind-controlled. However, augmentations will reduce your "humanity" score, which can be used to unlock some powerful skills later on in the game. The game also makes distinctions on what affects your humanity - getting a cybernetic eye won't reduce it much, but getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">cybernetic brain</a> sure as hell will.

By the end of the game however, its made <em>quite</em> clear that Otto was losing it even before he created the tentacles; interfacing with them certainly didnt help his mental state, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">resentment of others</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">arrogance</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">obsession with vengeance</a> were all there from the start</span>.

</li><li> Once you unlock the cyborg legacy perk, you can choose any cybernetic permutation, regardless of what faction you pick.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Although not focused at all in its story, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> makes a fair job depicting cyborgs. The Cybran nation is implied to be formed of normal people like anyone else, only much smarter to have their brain completely interfaced with a computer. The ones who actually lose their humanity are the ones enslaved by a program by the UEF, and are enslaved precisely because the UEF philosophy is that they lost their humanity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">That means they only become less human because the ones who consider them less than human make them less than human.</a> Dr. Brackman, the oldest character in the SupCom universe, is a Cyborg more than a thousand years old, but his personality seems to be still very human, for a scientist, even after being reduced to pretty much a brain in a jar by the time.
<ul><li> Still, the UEF at least believe the Cybran deserve to be live, as long as they live like machines. The Aeon, an entire faction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, consider the Cybran an atrocity and are more than happy to commit genocide against them at every chance instead of converting. Of course, this depends on the player considering the enslavement as being or not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.
<ul><li> Funny that, considering that the very Commanders of the Aeon (as well of the other factions) are completely interfaced neurally with their Armored Command Unit (pretty much a giant mecha that can make more giant mechas).
</li><li> Aeon Commanders are not neurally interfaced, specifically because of religious reasons. Instead, Aeon commanders wear distinctive facial makeup to make it easier for their helmets to analyze the commander's facial movements and interpret commands-The Way lends them strong enough self-control that they can literally use facial expressions to command their forces, in addition to hand-input commands.
</li></ul></li><li> With the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">UEF</a> treating the Cybrans like slaves and the Aeon and Seraphim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">trying to purge the galaxy of unbelievers</a>, the Cybran nation easily comes off as the nicest faction in the setting. They just want to be left alone and only fight to defend against Aeon genocide or to rescue the Symbionts who are still controlled by the UEF. In fact their main problem is their relative lack of unity; Brackman had to clone himself to get a neutral Commander the clans would rally around.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Averted in Real Life, unless it has something to do with the brain. Pacemakers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limbs</a>, artificial hearts, aural implants, and the like are fairly common knowledge in advanced medicine, and are not reported to have side effects of insanity, lobotomy, or other forms of radical personality change characteristic of this trope. However, some of the people who've received artificial hearts, specifically the continuous-flow design, have reported a feeling of unease and detachment due to no longer having a pulse.
</li><li> Brain implants have also been experimented with in primates, rats, and insects. Though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">implications</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">terrify</a> some humans (particularly with "roborats" whose behavior can be controlled by an implant in their pleasure center, and a few roboroaches that can apparently directed completely by remote control), it's not clear whether the critters themselves feel any different. Of course, we can't exactly ask them. In the interests of potentially freeing stroke victims, it's worthwhile research.
<ul><li> Experimental brain implants have already been installed on Alzheimer patients in clinical tests with positive results. They're still very simple, but prove once and for all that simply having silicon in your nervous system won't make you inhuman.
<ul><li> It's not like anyone seriously fears the extreme case ("having silicon in your nervous system" makes you psychotic or robotic). However, modern science still has a long way to go before it can disprove the more moderate case, that extensive use of cybernetics in one's body can change one's outlook (which is very likely, since all other known processes that mess with the brain can result in personality changes).
</li><li> The theory of "embodied cognition" (explained more fully in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://discovermagazine.com/2013/june/12-where-do-thoughts-occur">Discover Magazine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>) suggests that any change to the body will also change the thought process, since cognition does not only happen in the brain but throughout your anatomy. If that is indeed the case replacing body parts with cybernetics will almost certainly change someone's outlook. The jury is still out on exactly <em>how</em> it will change, but there is some evidence (outlined by <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141205-the-man-with-two-hearts">BBC Future<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>) that cybernetics that alter the awareness of what your body is doing may reduce empathy and intuition. If someone could be completely robbed of both through cybernetic enhancement he could certainly appear to have lost his soul.
</li></ul></li><li> And implants also <a class="urllink" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/06/parkinsons.deep.brain.stimulation/index.html">work with Parkinsons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A French man who was unable to hold a glass of water without the implant was fully independent and able to keep his job with those.
</li><li> Note that "roborats" aren't actually operated like a remote-control device. Their implants can provide a pleasurable sensation only, under circumstances (like searching a collapsed building for trapped survivors) where giving the rat a food-reward isn't possible. Conventional training is still necessary to get the rats to do what their handlers want.
<ul><li> A variant version of the "roborats" uses the portion of their brain connected to their whiskers, and the rat's natural tendency to move along a surface they can feel with them. Much like a person running their hand along the wall in the dark. This method allows for an essentially remote-controlled rat by tricking them into something they would do naturally.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain neural implants are designed to jam errant brain signals, like the ones that cause epileptic fits.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1149">This study<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> indicates that people will be able to handle unusual alterations to their body without being hit with full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>, making it even less likely that cybernetics will eat anyone's soul.
</li><li> It should be noted that the most commonly depicted symptom of soul-lessness, loss of emotion, is possible as emotional reactions are brought on through various chemicals, (neurotransmitters, adrenaline). Even something as simple as an antidepressant can make a person less emotional or even downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Straw Vulcan</a> with a sufficient dose. Cybernetics have the potential to affect, stimulate, or manipulate the production of these chemicals.
<ul><li> Human emotions are heavily dependent on hormonal status. Replacing of internal secretion glands certainly will lead to changes... For example, adrenaline surges, makes humans more susceptible for emotions, like fear. With automatically administered adrenaline, such reactions will not take place. Same applies for some other hormones, like testosterone. Summing up, brains in jars likely to have much more stable moods due to automatically regulated hormonal balance.
