It shows that two or more people can view the same event quite differently. The author invites the audience to hear them all out and then compare and contrast these divergent points of view. Sometimes the work provides no definitive answer as to what actually happened. Basically, it's a cast full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrators</a>. Other times, the audience might get the definitive true version of the story at the beginning or end of the episode; and usually both sides will be truthful about some things and exaggerate/outright lie about others.
</p><p>In reality, this condition is so common it's often said that if you have 12 witnesses to a crime, you'll often get <em>at least</em> 13 different stories of what happened. Police officers tend to use this to ferret out "real" witnesses from those whose story might be fabricated or staged with others, because two people will give different details of an event simply because of what they notice and where they were relative to where the event was, and if two (or more) people either give identical stories, match too closely or describe events in an identical fashion, it is extremely likely that one or more of them have been coached or is out-and-out lying.

This influential early example is a sophisticated use of this and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">unlike many later examples</a>, provides no definitive answers as to what the truth is. Nowadays, the "Rashomon Episode" is a staple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom">sitcoms</a> since it lends itself well to comedy.

</p><p><em>Note that this is not simply "a work, or events in a work, that is shown from multiple character perspectives."

Aimi's view of the events is centered around her and filled with romantic clichés. Kaoruko's view of the events reveals that Aimi's always been a bit self-centered, even as a kid.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome">prophetic dream</a> in the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> is from Madoka's point of view. She sees Homura struggling against a powerful witch and crying out for help, Kyubey tells her she could save Homura by becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a>, and she wakes up on the verge of deciding to do so. Near the end of the series, the audience sees the same event from Homura's perspective, and learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it happened in the past, not the future, and Homura wasn't crying for help. She was trying to tell Madoka not to listen to Kyubey, who was tricking her into becoming an overpowered witch so he could collect a huge dose of energy. Madoka couldn't hear it, so she contracted anyway and turned into a witch almost immediately after making said contract, explaining why the dream ended at that moment</span>.
</li><li> There are three important factions interested in Haruhi from the beginning in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>. Those are the espers, time travelers, and aliens. All of them offer different explanations for what exactly Haruhi is and what she did three years ago, as well as giving different explanations of their origins. The esper (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itsuki</span>) says Haruhi created all three groups, is possibly a god and remade the world three years ago. The time traveler (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikuru</span>) says time travelers came to investigate a problem Haruhi caused, that she's just a normal person with an odd ability and that she broke the time plane three years ago rather than remaking the universe. The alien (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuki</span>) spews a lot of big words that Kyon can't really understand, then later says she's not going to offer any more explanations because Kyon has no way of knowing if she's telling the truth while pointing out all three groups have good reason to lie to him. The implication is that <em>all three are partially correct</em>, but also either withholding information, mistaken or outright lying. It only gets more complicated from there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a></em>, one case seemingly was connected to a story told about an insane doctor who butchered injured soldiers in his care and tried to sew the body parts together to create an ultimate warrior. Later, another person remembers the same doctor as a kind person who was arrested for refusing to do unethical work. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kindaichi later realizes that the "butcher doctor" story was a red herring, leading him to realize that the murderer was the person who told him the false "butcher" version.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenkoZenrakeiSuieibuUmisho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenkoZenrakeiSuieibuUmisho">Kenko Zenrakei Suieibu Umisho</a></em> has one episode where Momoko and Sanae give differing views on how the swim club was formed. Sanae, known to be a liar and a storyteller, spins a web of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent">student-teacher relationships</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">Schoolgirl Lesbians</a>, but Momoko's side discounts both of those. At the end of the episode, a sign is given that Sanae may not have been entirely lying...
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> has the gang trying to figure out how the rent money was stolen, even though everyone seems to have an alibi.
</li><li> Episode 12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun">Simoun</a></em>, in regards to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the sexual encounter between Kaimu and Alti</span>. Each of them claims that the other initiated the act.
</li><li> An anime-only episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, "The Case of the Missing Takoyaki" features the residents of the Tendo household giving various recounts of how the contents a box of takoyaki were pilfered. The accounts are incomplete, and slanted to cast whoever they accused as being the villain. In the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Sasuke Sarugakure</a> reveals that everything happened in the order the other cast members describes; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they just each ate one takoyaki, which is how the box was emptied by the time Kasumi got back</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em> does this at least twice, with Ryoko and Ayeka telling wildly different versions of the same event, each one altering the story to make the teller seem morally superior to the other. i.e, there's their conflicting versions of how they met as little girls: Ryoko claims that Ayeka bullied the Hell out of her, whereas Ayeka says Ryoko was the real bully.
</li><li> A rather touching case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>. Simon tells about the time they were trapped in a cave-in, and says that he was only able to keep digging to get them out because Kamina was there to encourage him and kept his spirits up through the whole incident. Later the audience hears (via Yoko) Kamina's version of the same story, and Kamina says that he was only able to keep his cool because Simon kept digging and this gave <em>him</em> the courage he needed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TrueTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TrueTears">True Tears</a></em> has this for the conversation when Shinichiro entered Hiromi's room.
</li><li> One occurs during episode 12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Rinne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Rinne">RIN-NE</a></em>, when Ageha innocently holds Rinne's hands, with Sakura seeing it when she opens his door:
<ul><li> The first is with Ageha recalling the moment with Rinne. He looks a lot more handsome in her memory, prompting the narrator to state that her memory is slightly off.
</li><li> The second occurs with Sakura recalling the scene. Except she imagines it as him holding her hands rather firmly, as if they were lovers. Like in the previous example, the narrator states that this is not what happened.
</li><li> The third one is from Rokumon's point of view. He recalls it as Ageha and Rinne sharing a somewhat intimate moment together holding hands. Sakura then shows up, and both girls enter a hilarious staring contest at each other. The narrator once again states that this is totally wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run</a></em> has a case of this at one point. Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the (apparently) contradictory testimonies are all entirely accurate, due to some meddling by a villain with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">dimension-hopping powers</a></span>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There was one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a></em> story where Donald was called a hero for saving Daisy. Daisy, Gladstone and Huey, Dewey and Louie tell their own versions of the story.
<ul><li> In Daisy's version, all six were canoeing when suddenly some bees attacked , causing him to lose control of the canoe and crashing into a rock. Bad things happen and Daisy ends up getting on a log, directly aiming at a waterfall. Donald tries to save her by catching her at a nearby tree, but fails. Then he comes up with another plan — just before they are about to drop at the fall, he makes a particularly epic jump on the ground, holding Daisy.
</li><li> In Gladstone's version, there are no bees, but Donald crashes into a rock because he is an idiot. Then he doesn't run into a tree to save Daisy, but to escape a lynx. And they are not saved from the waterfall by Donald's jumping abilities, but a particularly ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>; a ROCK SLIDE that stops the log.

</div></li><li> In Huey, Dewey and Louie's version, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both bees and lynx are very existent, but the real kicker is that where the rock slide came from: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">It was caused by Huey, Dewey and Louie.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">It was intentional</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroSquared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroSquared">Hero Squared</a></em>, the superhero and supervillain from the destroyed comic book universe briefly recount to other characters how the universe was destroyed from their perspective. In the superhero's narrative, he's attempting to save reality from an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> who ends up destroying all of creation out of spite. In the supervillain's story, she's innocently going about her business when the superhero and his cronies burst in in a fit of self-righteous violence and ham-fistedly smash up her lab despite her protests, destroying reality through blundering incompetence.

The tent poles of the story: Carmelita was on her first case for Interpol; Sly shows up, Carmelita ties up Sly, Sly gets away, a jewel that Carmelita was supposed to be guarding was stolen, then the thief (a stage manager) is found tied up. Everything else, well, let's just say it's your typical Sly-Carmelita conversation (during the Sucker Punch era, anyway). A couple lines between them sums up the trope nicely (paraphrased from memory):
<div class="indent"><strong>Carmelita</strong>: Wait a moment. I took you out single-handedly!

Jameson describes the robber similarly, himself as the hero, and Spider-Man as a coward and a criminal.

To the cop, Hotshot was a supervillain and the Hulk was a former Avenger coming to save the day. To the old lady, Hotshot was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Troubled, but Cute</a> figure, who was acting out of love and looked "just like James Dean", and the Hulk was a monster attacking him without real cause.

At the end they see the reality; he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">a guy in a suit</a>. Which was based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> "Legends of the Dark Knight" which itself was based on a 1970s story from the comics called "The Batman Nobody Knows", by Len Wein. One of the kids' story was what happened (according to his uncle), which was told in the style of comic book artist Dick Sprang and the '60s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> show, while the others are their own theories on what Batman looks like (with one of them being a retelling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>). The other kid thought Batman was a bat-like creature that snatches criminals, similar to post Post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour">Zero Hour</a></em> interpretations of Superman's first encounter with Batman, whom he thought to be some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">metahuman</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hoodwinked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hoodwinked">Hoodwinked!</a></em> is essentially a Rashomon version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood">Little Red Riding Hood</a>, with the framing device of each character undergoing a police interrogation. When characters' stories cross paths, the scene is told again, but there's differences in dialogue, character actions, and set lighting (some subtle, some major). A perfect example is Red Puckett's first interaction with the Wolf after she falls out of the cable car. In Red's version, the tree canopy is thick and barely lets in any light, the Wolf appears quite suddenly behind her, and when she refuses to answer his questions he lets out a wild roar. In the Wolf's version, it's as clear and brightly lit as every other scene, he walks out casually from behind a bush, and his "roar" is a high-pitched yelp of pain because of his tail getting caught in Twitchy's camera at the wrong time. Both versions have Red take off running, but is then cornered by the Wolf again. Red's version has her running in a straight line through the trees, only for him to seemingly materialize in front of her. In the Wolf's version, it turns out he got ahead of her by taking a taxi, and Red also navigates carefully through the trees. In both versions, he steps out and says "Hand over the basket," to which Red squirts "Wolf-Away" spray into his eyes. In Red's version, she immediately takes off running after that. In the Wolf's version, she also delivers a karate-style beat-down, ending with a spin-kick, before running. His reaction to the Wolf-Away also slightly differs, his cry of pain being a bit sharper in his story.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon">Rashomon</a></em> is both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMakers">Trope Maker</a>. In medieval Japan a husband and wife are accosted by a bandit. We see the story of the encounter only in flashback. Facts common to all stories: 1) The husband is overpowered and tied up by the bandit, 2) there is a sexual encounter between the bandit and the wife, and 3) the husband ends up dead. At the murder trial each principal tells a different story of the incident that puts him/herself in a good light, but each confesses to the murder, so we don't believe anyone is outright lying just to conceal his/her own guilt. For the sake of getting the husband's story first hand, we are asked to believe that a local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Shrine Maiden</a> is able to summon his spirit to testify.
<ul><li> The bandit claims the sex was consensual and the wife wanted to leave her husband for him. He killed the husband in a spectacular sword fight between highly skilled warriors over possession of the woman.
</li><li> The wife claims that she was raped. When her husband demonstrated a sneering contempt for her helpless submission to the bandit, she accidentally killed him with a knife in her shock at his betrayal.
</li><li> The husband also claims the sex was consensual. In his story the unfaithful wife wants to start a new life with the bandit, but urges him to kill her husband. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">disgusts even the bandit</a>, who offers to kill her to the husband, then releases him after the wife runs away. Overcome with sorrow and shame, he takes his own life (his story is told through a medium).
</li><li> A woodcutter claims to have seen the whole thing. In his story, the sex is a rape, and both the bandit and the husband decide afterwards that neither of them actually want the woman. As she's about to be abandoned, the wife taunts the two into fighting for their own honor, if not for hers. The fight is a messy, comic brawl between ill-prepared cowards ending in the husband's death. Even the woodcutter's story is suspect, however. When his audience asks what happened to the wife's ornate dagger, he's accused of stealing it and looks guilty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Basic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Basic">Basic</a></em> centers on a pair of military investigators trying to figure out what happened during a training exercise in which all but two of a team of special-forces operatives died or disappeared, with both survivors telling conflicting (and frequently changing) versions of the story. It's an interesting version of the trope, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>none</em> of the stories are true, and we're never shown what happened.

Along the way, things are not as they seem and when they supposedly catch the real killers, they tell a different version of what happened. In the final confrontation, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the surviving partner is shot and gives what appears to be a deathbed confession of what really happened</span>.

However, he repeatedly fails to show up at all to their arranged meetings. Growing increasingly distraught, she finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempts suicide</span>.

The Emperor, however, doesn't believe the details of the account, so he tells what he thinks happened. The soldier admits that he wasn't telling the truth, and tells what actually happened.

The events leading up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an attempt to abduct the US President</span>, told from eight perspectives, each revealing more information than the last. Only in the last telling do we have the whole story and the aftermath. Though in this case, none of the perspectives are objectively wrong; it's just that most of them are operating with incomplete information.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wonderland">Wonderland</a></em> depicts a true-life example, in which two different parties, one of whom is porn legend John Holmes, give detectives accounts of the events leading to a brutal multiple murder. Each party places the greater share of blame on the other, and as in real life, no definitive conclusion is reached; although a third account is introduced (again true-to-life, though it did not surface until after Holmes' trial) that indicates that not only was Holmes lying, he was (involuntarily) involved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvesBayou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvesBayou">Eve's Bayou</a></em>, both Louis and teenaged daughter Cicely's accounts differ on what happened the night after Louis had too much to drink after a heated argument with wife Roz, and Cicely went to sit with him. In Cicely's version, Louis got aggressive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">tried to rape her</a>, and when she resisted, he slapped her to the floor. This leads to Eve placing a voodoo curse on him. Later, we find out Louis' version of that night, where <em>she</em> was the aggressor, giving him a sweet peck on the lips then suddenly started kissing him "like a woman," and he slapped her to get her off of him. The movie ends without us ever finding out what really happened.

Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury">Ghost Dog</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFamilyForTheWholeFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFamilyForTheWholeFamily">Louie the mobster</a> have a flashback to when they first encountered each other. In both cases Ghost Dog is getting beat viciously by a group of thugs, and Louie comes over to end the disturbance. In Louie's version of events the leader of the group hesitates a second, then pulls a gun and points it at Louie, at which point Louie shoots him in self-defense and the rest of his gang run away. In Ghost Dog's version, the guy points a gun at Ghost Dog, and Louie then saves Ghost Dog's life by pulling the trigger first, which adds much more onto the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">I Owe You My Life</a> thing that Ghost Dog has going on towards Louie.
</li><li> <em>Valerie</em>: This 1956 western begins with a shootout, which results in the arrest of a man (Sterling Hayden) for wounding his wife (Anita Ekberg) and killing her parents. At the subsequent trial, several people describe different points of view on the events leading up to the shooting, with the man painted as either a blameless cuckold or a brutal thug.

Next, Kylo tells Rey that he turned to the Dark Side because Luke tried to murder him in his sleep out of fear of his power. Finally, after Rey confronts him, Luke tells her the most complete version of the story: for a brief moment he had a lapse in judgment and indeed was about to murder Ben in his sleep because he sensed a deep well of darkness in his pupil. Luke immediately regretted it, but it was too late - Ben Solo saw his master's activated lightsaber and attacked. Luke views Ben's transformation into the dark Kylo Ren as his own fault and is racked by guilt.</span>

Both versions are dramatized by the actors portraying them. As the film cuts between the two versions, the actors occasionally make a comment that actually pertains to the <em>other</em> version of the events just before the scene cuts to it
</li><li> Roughly the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnivesOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnivesOut">Knives Out</a></em> plays out in this manner. Different members of the Thrombey family are tasked with telling the story of the night of the family patriarch Harlan's 85th birthday (after which he died), and all do so in rather different ways. A notable example is the visual of different family members standing next to Harlan as he's presented with the birthday cake, depending on the story.

</li><li> The time when James saved Snape's life crop up several times, from a few perspectives. In the first book, Dumbledore mentions to Harry in passing that James saved Snape's life and Snape never forgave him for it, because it meant he had to repay the debt before he could go back to "hating [Harry's father's] memory in peace". In the third book, when Harry calls out Snape for not being grateful to his father for saving him, Snape replies that James was only saving his own skin because the cause of near death was a prank James was playing and, had it been successful, he would have been expelled. At the end of the third book, Lupin explains that Sirius convinced Snape to enter the Shrieking Shack while Lupin was transforming into a werewolf inside it. Snape only suspected the werewolf bit and James kept him from going all the way in. However, Snape believed that James and Lupin were in on the plot the whole time.

It features four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrators</a>, all with his particular take on the same intricate series of events. As an added twist, each subsequent narrator is moved to write his own version after <em>reading</em> the earlier ones, so each subsequent testimony also includes clarifications, annotations, comments, criticism, refutations and fillings of the blanks. There's no "definitive version of what really happened" either.

</li><li> The three holy books of the Abrahamic faiths have this to varying degrees.
<ul><li> The Christian <em>New Testament</em> begins with the four Gospels, each credit as being "The Gospel according to" a different author. There's some noticeable discrepancies between them for which non-Christians sometimes cite as proof for it being inaccurate, making this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. One such example is how each Gospel portrayed Jesus: Matthew had him as an Expy of Moses and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">cited a myriad of Old Testament prophecies</a> to really drive the whole Messiah thing home; the intended audience was probably Jews. Mark's gospel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> and puts emphasis on Jesus' miracles because his audience was Christians persecuted by the Romans. Luke's gospel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>, portraying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> version of Jesus because he was targeting Gentiles who had/were considering converting. John's gospel is the most mystic-like of the four and writes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherSelf">Higher Self</a> version of Jesus to emphasize His divinity to committed Christians.
<ul><li> A scholarly article on the subject: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tektonics.org/whatis/whatinspire.php">http://www.tektonics.org/whatis/whatinspire.php<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Paul's recollection of his own history and that of the Church is slightly different to Luke's, though both of them were summarizing a little.
</li><li> The <em>Old Testament</em> features two different stories of Creation, one immediately after the other: the first being the famous "And on the Xth day, God Y." Which has humans created last, while the second account has humans created before animals, and has the whole Garden of Eden story. A likely reconciliation is that the second one starts with a summary before going into Eden; Chapter 1 was "He made X and then He made Y and then He made Z" while Chapter 2 was "Look at all the stuff He made, like Ys and Zs and Xes!" A few chapters later, the Book of Genesis includes two conflicting accounts of the Great Flood that are interleaved.
</li><li> Many other stories have seemingly conflicting accounts between them, such as the story of David, and anyone from David to Saul to someone else to some random Israelite killing Goliath. The confusion about Goliath probably stems from there being two Goliaths. Goliath the Philistine whom David killed with the sling, and Goliath the Gittite who was killed by Elhanan at Gob.

While not made in the traditional way, only the main facts remain with each retelling, as people can't even remember what weather was that day, and it goes down from there.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">one of the few things about this novel we're reasonably sure of</a>.
</li><li> Peter Matthiessen's <em>Killing Mister Watson</em> trilogy, recently revised into <em>Shadow Country,</em> relies heavily on the Rashomon effect.
</li><li> <em>The Lover</em>, a novel by Israeli writer A. B. Yehoshua, is told from the viewpoints of the six major characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrHooksBigBlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrHooksBigBlackBox">Mr. Hook's Big Black Box</a></em> has a group of friends meet up at a college reunion, and end up discussing events that happened when they were students. All of the flashbacks are unreliable, and all of the narrators tried to double-cross their friends at least once.
</li><li> Santiago Gamboa's <em>Necropolis</em> has the life story of a speaker who killed himself during a writer's congress retold three times by himself, his partner, and his wife.
</li><li> Ken Kesey's novel <em>Sometimes a Great Notion</em> makes heavy use of this trope, weaving together the narratives of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">several warring family members and townspeople</a> to illustrate the interpersonal conflicts surrounding a town-wide lumber strike. For added fun, sometimes POV shifts happen mid-sentence.
</li><li> Jeff Rackham's <em>The Rag &amp; Bone Shop</em> tells the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a>' relationship with Ellen Ternan from three different points of view: those of Ellen, Dickens' sister-in-law Georgina Hogarth, and his friend and colleague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilkieCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilkieCollins">Wilkie Collins</a>. All three suffer from various degrees of self-delusion, especially Georgina.
</li><li> The Akutagawa short story that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon">Rashomon</a></em> is based on, <em>In a Grove</em>. Two people confess to the same murder, three if you count the dead man since he claims to have stabbed himself and would have bled to death anyways. Confusingly, "Rashomon" is also the name of an entirely different Akutagawa story, which is very creepy but rather less of a mind screw. <em>Rashomon</em> shares a theme with <em>In a Grove</em> — Self-Justification: An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer">Old Retainer</a> has been fired from his job and is under the Rashomon Gates contemplating suicide. Then he sees an old hag who is seemingly doing unspeakable things to some dead bodies. He feels so much fear and revulsion that he is willing to die before letting the hag do whatever she is doing. When he tries to stop her, the hag reveals she is robbing the corpses because she needs the money and they not. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer">Old Retainer</a> realizes that he was thinking first of suicide, then of dying for a good cause, and now he understand that his feelings are nothing more than a way to justify his acts, so he chooses to do the act that benefit him the most, and steal the goods from the old hag.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertBrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertBrowning">Robert Browning</a>'s <em>The Ring and the Book,</em> an epic-length series of dramatic monologues based on a real Italian murder case. Everybody involved chimes in, including the murderer and the victim.
</li><li> Surprisingly, a picture book: <em>Voices in the Park</em> by Anthony Browne.
</li><li> The first half or so of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> novel <em>I, Jedi</em> is one of these for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Jedi Academy Trilogy</a>.</em> It gives a contrasting point of view of the events of that series without actually contradicting any of it, while simultaneously filling in a variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Holes</a>. The second half of the book tells the conclusion of the conflict that Corran Horn went to the academy to learn to deal with, which is related to, but separate from, the story of the happenings at the academy. Most consider it better than the trilogy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> 's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveLittlePigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveLittlePigs">Five Little Pigs</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Hercule Poirot</a> solve a murder that took place sixteen years before by listening to the stories of the 5 people involved, who each provided a slightly different account on what had actually happened.
</li><li> An odd variation on this concept is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuillsWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuillsWindow">Quill's Window</a></em>. Events are portrayed objectively as they happen- the important change, however, is that different characters interpret these events in different ways. We'll see the event in question from the point of view of one character in the book, but later on it will be referenced by other characters as having had entirely different personal connotations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hoot">Hoot</a></em> has a variant. It's narrated in the third person, and as the story jumps between three main characters - Roy Eberhardt, Officer Delinko, and Curly Branitt - there are occasional narration overlaps. For instance, when Curly encounters the guard dog trainer Kalo trying to round up his dogs after the snakes are placed out, Delinko stops by and the event is described from Curly's point-of-view. In a later chapter that follows Delinko, a small summary of the same scene (from his perspective) is shown.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy">The Bartimaeus Trilogy</a></em>. All the narrators are unreliable, with Kitty being the closest to a reliable one.
<ul><li> Nathaniel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> outfit at the beginning of the second book. Whereas Nathaniel thinks that it is, well, badass, Bartimaeus finds it completely ridiculous and Kitty proclaims it kind of stupid, though it is not clear if she just says this because she hates magicians in general or because the outfit really is stupid.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Bartimaeus'</a> illusions of grandeur are dashed by the third-person (and therefore more accurate) narration of Nathaniel or Kitty, though of course he's always damn cool, whether he calmly asks the whiny boy to "please be quiet" or shrieks at him to "shut up!".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpoonRiverAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpoonRiverAnthology">Spoon River Anthology</a></em> has this as one of its main conceits. Unusually for this trope, we generally get an idea of what's true — for instance, a former mayor and moral crusader is clearly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> and murderer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSlap">The Slap</a></em> by Christos Tsiolkas.
</li><li> "The Moonlit Road" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmbroseBierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmbroseBierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>. Like Akutagawa's "In a Grove," which it may have inspired, it contains testimony from both the living and the dead.
</li><li> This is explored in the Scottish novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrivateMemoirsAndConfessionsOfAJustifiedSinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrivateMemoirsAndConfessionsOfAJustifiedSinner">The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</a></em>. The story is divided into two main sections: one first-hand account of the life of a religious fanatic, and an editor's attempt to piece together relevant events a hundred years later. Essentially, both are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">unreliable narrators</a>, but the Sinner's account is especially skewed towards portraying him as more noble and righteous. For instance, according to eyewitnesses, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed his brother</span> by stabbing him in the back from the shadows. He himself claims he shouted a warning and engaged in a duel.
</li><li> This is parodied in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EoinColfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EoinColfer">Eoin Colfer</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndAnotherThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndAnotherThing">And Another Thing...</a></em>. The characters briefly discuss how they got out of a particular jam. One remembers getting world leaders together to save the planet. Another remembers unicorns flying to their rescue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">None are correct; their escape was only a simulation, and they're actually about to get blown up.</span>
</li><li> The prologues to each book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> are an excerpt from an in-universe document that gives a piece of history relevant to the book in question—for the most part these are in accord, but the last one comes from <em>The Book of Torak</em>, holy text of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a> authored by (or possibly ghostwritten for by one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Disciples</a>) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. It retells many of the same <em>events</em> but puts a <em>radically</em> different perspective on them- and one that Torak seems to actually believe, which really hits home just how crazy he is.
<ul><li> The biographies of Belgarath and Polgara disagree on exactly how a lot of things went down.
</li></ul></li><li> In Raymond Queneau's <em>Exercises in Style</em>, where the same story is told in 99 different ways, we have the subjective points of view of two protagonists.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a></em> novel <em>Lucifer Rising</em> has a version involving a futuristic surveillance system that makes only a basic record of what happens, relying on computer extrapolation to fill in the details when it's played back. It becomes both sides of a Rashomon Style dispute about what really happened in a certain conversation, producing two different extrapolations in which the speakers perform the same actions and say the same words, but the <em>way</em> they do it makes the difference between the version where one speaker was trying to help the other and the version where he was deliberately making matters worse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> contains many versions of the same events by different characters, and, in some cases, by newspapers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyRevolutions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyRevolutions">Only Revolutions</a></em> has one side of the story by one protagonist, the other side of the story by the other protagonist. Given the sheer length of time that the story covers, it makes sense for there to be discrepancies. However, there are more than just discrepancies, as both sides tell it in a way to make themselves look good at various points and have different recollections altogether of certain events.
</li><li> The Egyptian novel <em>Miramar</em> (by Egypt's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NobelPrizeInLiterature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NobelPrizeInLiterature">Nobel Laureate for Literature</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naguib_Mahfouz">Naguib Mahfouz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) is told four times in the first person from the perspective of four lodgers at a <em>pension</em> (a kind of boarding house) in 1960s Alexandria: the aging intellectual and former journalist Amir Wagdy; the young, wealthy, well-connected, and self-destructive scion of a once-noble family Husni Allam; the elegant broadcaster Mansour Bahi; and the factory manager and Party functionary Sarhan al-Beheiri. All four men pursue the young, uneducated, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">plucky</a> peasant woman Zohra, newly arrived from the countryside. All four stories end with the death — probably by suicide — of Sarhan. The narrators are biased but not really unreliable; they differ in their interpretation of character and motives, but don't disagree about facts.
</li><li> Mahfouz used the same technique in <em>Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth</em>, which tells the story of Pharaoh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Akhenaten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a>'s short reign and scandalous behaviour from the POV of more than a dozen different characters. Most of them agree on <em>what</em> happened, though <em>why</em> is another matter... The only thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">most of them agree on</a> is that this monotheism business <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">died with the Pharaoh</a>.

</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a> enters the Sierra Morena at chapter XII, First Part, he hears the account of the love of Chrysostom to Marcela from the shepherd Pedro. It seems Marcela, an orphaned rich girl, in a whim decided to be shepherdess, and she is so beautiful all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityMouse">City Mouses</a> suitors have become shepherds only to woe her. She never give anyone any hope, so the Sierra Morena is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyrs</a>, and they are going tomorrow to the funeral of one of them, Chrysostom. Pedro describes Marcela as a good person. At the funeral, Ambrosio, Chrysostoms best friends, accuses Marcela of cruelty against Chrysostom. When confronted by his listeners about Marcelas character, he admits this was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">Informed Flaw</a>. Later, they read one of Chrysostoms poems and he claims to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a> and Marcela being cruel to him. At last, Marcela appears at the funeral and claims that she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse">So Beautiful, It's a Curse</a> and, as a free, decent woman, she had the right to reject anyone.

To Archie the plumber acts and dresses like a Mafia Don while the assistant is a menacing, Black Power sign throwing street thug with a giant afro and chip on his shoulder.

<ul><li> "Perspectives on Christmas". In this example, the characters' perspectives differed mainly in what they were able to see and how they interpreted certain lines of dialogue (as is the norm for misunderstandings on this show), rather than blatantly skewing things in their favor as in most comedic examples.
</li><li> "Shrink Rap", in which both brothers undergo 'couples' counseling and outline the events which have led to their most recent relationship collapse. In general, they have a tendency to present themselves as being a bit more wise, thoughtful, and put-upon than they probably would be in the real situation — and the other immediately calls them on it. There's also a rather amusing bit where Niles recounts a story Daphne told about a couple who would frequently experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm">The Immodest Orgasm</a> right next to her bedroom wall at night, and her over-the-top efforts to show them up, culminating in this exchange:

The most notable thing about this, is none of the events were actually changed in either retelling - both characters used the same lines, and the same things happened, albeit with different severity in both (example: In Debra's retelling Ray opens a can of tuna and overreacts to a small amount of spillage - in Ray's, the can almost explodes and he's rather nonchalant about it). The tone used by the characters in each version gives the exact same lines entirely different contexts.

<ul><li> Harry and Laverne recall their first meeting at her job interview in a dispute over whether she ever promised to wear a nursing cap. In Harry's version, Laverne is a naive country bumpkin, in Laverne's she is competent and professional (perhaps overly so) and a weak and indecisive Harry defers to her.
</li><li> Another episode has the characters having dinner together and reminiscing about the time the oven caught fire. They begin discussing the incident from their own perspectives. Laverne recalls Carol upset over a recent breakup while Carol recalls the same breakup left her happy. Charlie recalls he was the life of the party that night, but doesn't remember the oven catching fire.

When they try to take statements from witnesses, their descriptions of the car are completely incongruous.

Given that they're all young children, it...doesn't yield much in the way of useful information.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cragen:</strong> Kids give you anything? <br/><strong>Elliot:</strong> Yeah, about 40 different versions about what happened. <br/><strong>Cragen:</strong> Well, eyewitness accounts are bad enough with adults, what'd you expect from kids? <br/><strong>Huang:</strong> Wild imaginations, high suggestibility, and difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality. <br/><strong>Elliot:</strong> That's pretty much what I got.
</div></li><li> In a later episode of <em>SVU</em>, Elliot and Olivia are trying to solve a cold kidnapping case; they note that they have three witness statements describing the car, and all of them disagree on color and body type. Incredibly, they still get a lead from that when one of the descriptions matches the car of a possible suspect.

While testifying, Frank speaks (and narrates) his version of events, in which he struggles heroically to treat the wounded while the other surgeons mewl and cower. During the scenes accompanying Frank's narrative he is shot in soft-focus, gleaming and white while shots of Hawk and Beej are dingy and unflattering. Hawkeye gave his version of events (which more or less, falls in line with the way the characters normally act).
<div class="indent"><strong>Hawkeye:</strong> The Major's version of what happened was, to say the least, fascinating. It was, to say the most, perjury! No, to be fair, I have no doubt that he remembers it that way. More's the pity. And there was <em>some</em> truth to the story. It <em>was</em> October 11 and we <em>were</em> in Korea.

The hook was you needed everyone's perspective to know what happened, but once you had that there was no argument over what really happened. Boomtown would be better described as objectively following various characters in overlapping timelines rather than showing their subjective perspectives on a single event, as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon">Rashomon</a></em>.

Each gives a different version of the events. Magnum focuses on the details of the robbery that <em>don't</em> change in the retelling, and cracks the case.

There were some slight (but implausible) edits: Jack's re-telling has Syd saying "Jack's so brave!", while Bridge's has him shooting the last of the Krybots he was fighting. A funny part is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Bridge</a> complains how he keeps losing count of his kills in everyone's stories (this is the one scene everyone tells the same way).

Although she can no longer talk, Vicki provides the real story when Ted connects her to the hotel TV set.
</li><li> <em>Thunder Alley</em>: Gil and his daughter argue over who owns some rare baseball cards. Their respective flashbacks to when Gil supposedly gave them to her contradict each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>: "Rashomama". This was a hilariously well-done episode. Nick's car is stolen — and with it all the evidence collected at a wedding where the groom's mother was murdered. The CSIs recount events to get their stories straight for when Internal Affairs questions them. Each start from listening to David the Coroner make a joke about the deceased and walking through an arch of flowers, and from there, things diverge. Sara injects her irritation with marriage, Nick thoroughly enjoys the atmosphere, Grissom waxes poetic about the floral arrangements, and Greg recalls events in film noir style. (Though the episode is actually <em>Rashomon</em>-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>; none of the investigators' memories or witnesses' statements actually contradict each other.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, one story tells how four main characters tricked each other on some stolen silverware, each "part" told from a different character's view. Interesting in that none of the accounts conflict with each other, only differing in events that the character telling the story couldn't have known about. They form one long storyline with each account following the previous instead.
</li><li> Creator Greg Garcia's next series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaisingHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaisingHope">Raising Hope</a></em>, did a similar episode, where the family recall the story of how Burt was kidnapped. Each person's story isn't so much changing the perspective as adding on facts that only they could've known.

For good measure, the episode starts with the very end of the food fight. Kate and Tudgeman's stories featured ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> versions of themselves. Kate, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, imagines herself walking around the school on a red carpet with a spotlight shining on her while everyone else gushes about how perfect she is. Tudgeman, a dorky nerd, sees himself as the star of some cross between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind">A Beautiful Mind</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>.

The only witness who comes close on the last one is a military man.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em>, Catherine Duke decided to leave the station, but nobody was paying attention when she was telling why she decided to leave. The station owner, Jimmy James, wants to know why Catherine left, prompting about five different versions of the story, culminating with Jimmy's impression of what happened, a nonsensical sequence combining elements from each story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheOddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheOddCouple">The Odd Couple</a></em> has an episode that describes a party where Oscar and Blanche's marriage went on the rocks: first Oscar tells how Blanche was a drunk and Felix was a meddlesome whiner; then Blanche tells how Oscar was a lecher and Felix was a meddlesome whiner; then Felix tells how he was the life of the party and valiantly tried to save Oscar and Blanche's marriage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em>: "Through a Glass Darkly" features a Rashomon-style historical flashback.

Riker has one story; the people who think Riker murdered one of their scientists have another; and Deanna Troi tells Captain Picard that both sides are telling the truth, or rather what they believe is the truth. The actual truth does come out, but only because the holodeck recreates the crime scene almost exactly and is left on "crime scene." Also, all versions of the story have common threads that are consistent between them, and those threads also help lead to the truth. Riker is absolved of the murder, however, exactly what happened between Riker and the scientist's wife is left nebulous. The possibilities left open are her seducing him, him trying to rape her, and them mutually throwing themselves at each other. Sure, we know Riker as a ladies man, but you never know... Or Riker and the wife simply misunderstood each other due to each perceiving the other's body language through their alien cultural viewpoint.

The Klingon captain, Duras, claims that Archer formed an alliance with anti-imperial rebels and launched an unprovoked attack on his battlecruiser.

They end up having a pool party without Uncle Phil's permission, and Uncle Phil takes them to court about the whole ordeal. In court they tell outrageously different versions of the pool party:
<ol><li> In Will and Carlton's version, the pool party is a classy, innocent affair where everyone is in old-style bathing suits and they dance in a circle holding hands. When Uncle Phil enters, a glass of water shakes à la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> and he rips the head off of Carlton's duckie inner tube. He also yells at the 15-year-old neighbor girl who "wandered over, crying" as Will says. ("Hit the bricks, you little tramp!")
</li><li> In Uncle Phil's version, Will and Carlton are thuggish, and everyone is wearing revealing swimsuits, including the 15-year-old neighbor girl who wandered over, cheerfully saying "To hell with my parents! ...Will taught me that." Uncle Phil himself is just a meek, quiet man who accidentally steps on Carlton's inflatable duckie inner tube. He told his story second and, when stopped, pointed out the others had been allowed to tell their cock-and-bull story.
</li><li> Of course, we saw the real pool party beforehand, where the party was not thuggish (but certainly not innocent), the 15-year-old neighbor wanders in on her own (not crying and not wearing a revealing swimsuit), and Uncle Phil spitefully pokes a pin in Carlton's duckie inner tube.
</li></ol></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, because Ted is (sometimes) an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, we sometimes see something from Ted's point of view only to have someone else explain what really happened.
<ul><li> In one episode, Ted is dating a woman who he introduces to his friends. At first we see it from Ted's point of view - Said woman says a sentence, then one of his friends seems to interrupt her with a thinly veiled 'Shut up!'. Then, the other characters reveal that she talks a lot (something an enamoured Ted hadn't noticed), and we cut back to her talking and talking and talking...
</li><li> The St Patrick's Day episode had a subtler version: we see Ted go out with Barney and have a fun, carefree night, but the following day Marshall calls him out and shows that Ted spent the entire night acting like a selfish jackass.
</li><li> In "As Fast as She Can", Barney claims that when he was pulled over by a hot female officer, she asked him to get out of the car so he could do her. Robin and Marshall know that he was lying, but he denies it, and Future Ted interrupts saying that what really happened was that same cop arrested Barney for numerous moving violations and he and Stella had to bail him out.
</li><li> And another episode has Marshall on the phone the entire time with different characters, learning how recent events transpired. Every scene is covered multiple times from different perspectives. At the end, he sets up a storyboard so he can go over everything with his mother and brother who, at different times, had been listening in.
</li><li> In "The Ashtray" Ted, Robin and Lily tell the others about running into "The Captain" (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleMcLachlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleMcLachlan">Kyle Mc Lachlan</a>) at an art gallery and going to his apartment. In Ted's version the Captain is still angry at Ted for dating his ex-wife and threatens him with a harpoon gun. In Robin's version the Captain comes onto her the whole night. In Lily's story, which is the truth, Ted is stoned and Robin is drunk and the one coming onto the Captain. In all three Barney tries to inject himself in the story even though he wasn't there. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though oddly the Captain seems to corroborate Barney's story that he pulled a play on the cute art consultant that worked for the Captain.</span>
</li><li> In "Zoo or False", there is a self-contradicting example. Marshall recounts the story of how he was mugged. When Lily starts talking about getting a gun, he changes the story to say he was actually mugged by a monkey. He goes on Robin's show to tell the story, but when the zookeeper also comes on and reveals that the monkey is to be released into the wild and be separated from its mate, Marshall says he was mugged by a human. When Lily reacts to this, he waffles back and forth several times before clamming up, and the truth is never settled. Though it's worth noting that the monkey story is not at all credible.

Everyone told their own story to the cops, varying details like the style of music the robber used to announce his intentions, and often playing up their own role.

</li></ul></li><li> The YTV program <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RadioActive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RadioActive">Radio Active</a></em> does this in one episode — one student tries to find out what happened to cause a CD to get damaged, and so asks the other students. Each one had a different report on what happened in the room, how everyone acted and what happened to the CD (one student claims he caught it in his teeth after another threw it at him). The only constant in any of them is one of the students reading a comic book wearing a hat (which changes depending on who's telling it). That student's retelling consists entirely of a shot of a comic book while the voices of the other cast members can be heard babbling incoherently in the background.
<ul><li> Also happened in Radio Active's French Canadian precursor, Radio Enfer (Hell Radio). Budding journalist Vincent tries to figure out who stole a prize envelop during a gala. High-strung Camille who was in charge of the whole night sees everyone as moving in slow motion, while Maria's version is similar to a soap opera (complete with love and betrayal). Jean-Lou's version (which nearly broke Vincent) was a children's TV show and focused on a cake instead of the prize.

Regine is creating a raisin cookie recipe for a contest, and Khadijah shares that the secret to her grandma's famous raisin cookies was prune juice. Later, when she tastes Regine's prize-winning cookies, she accuses Regine of stealing grandma's recipe. Regine denies the theft. Regine's story paints Khadijah as a gruff belligerent thug, while Khadijah's story makes Regine out to be a snooty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>. Both ladies pretend they themselves were perfectly innocent and agreeable. The one constant in both stories is that Maxine comes over in the middle of the baking, says, "I'm too lazy to cook for myself, so I'm gonna mooch off you guys," and helps herself to plum sauce for her Chinese food. Not only is Max the one constant in each story, but she turns out to be the culprit all along; when she came over to mooch Chinese food, she inadvertently spilled plum sauce all in Regine's cookie dough, thus lending the cookies a pronounced prune flavor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> does this when Jackie and Hyde explain how they got together. In Jackie's version, Hyde had been a perfect gentleman, and even called her "my lady." In Hyde's version, Jackie simply shows up in the basement and tells him "I want you". In the end, Donna wonders out loud "how the hell all this happened", which is followed by a depiction of what really happened. The two had been watching TV together when they started talking, and realized that they were both bored and lonely...at which point they then proceeded to jump each other.
</li><li> Somewhat used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePhilanthropist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePhilanthropist">The Philanthropist</a></em>. Every episode takes the form of a story being recounted, usually by Rist.

The episode is named "I Saw What I Saw". The facts are consistent, but the opinions are often at odds (pointed out repeatedly via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEchoCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEchoCut">Ironic Echo Cut</a>). For instance, Alex appeared to be shaky after donating blood, but it was later revealed that he left before donating, and was actually shaky because of a phone call from Izzie.
</li><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ADifferentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ADifferentWorld">A Different World</a></em> episode "The Cat's In The Cradle", in which Dwayne and Ron are arrested by campus police for brawling with three white students from another college. As usual, each party's version of the event pairs this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">Self-Serving Memory</a>, but there is a twist on the Rashomon style in that audience gets to see what happened right away and knows fully well that they're exaggerating:
<ul><li> Both Ron and two of the white students said and did things to provoke each other, while the third futilely tried to keep the incident from escalating. The fight began when one of the white students spray-painted a racial slur on Ron's car, at which point Dwayne showed up and jumped in to help.
</li><li> In Ron's version, the attack was completely unprovoked. He downplays his antagonistic comments, unfairly depicts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a> as just as aggressive as his friends, and when Dwayne arrives, he is seen meekly pleading for the attackers to "stop, stop".
</li><li> Similarly, the white student who tells his story claims that THEY were the innocent victims, portrays Dwayne and Ron as stereotypical street thugs and conveniently neglects to mention vandalizing Ron's car.
</li></ul></li><li> The television series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fame">Fame</a></em> has an episode involving a student being injured during a stage performance, and the teachers of the School of the Arts questioning different eye-witnesses.

Turns out he was mad at the both of them because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they forgot his 40th birthday</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> episode "Folding Man" is entirely an homage to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon">Rashomon</a></em>.

JJ, Michael, and Thelma each tell Willona what happened. Of course when each tells their story, they paint themselves in an extremely flattering light and make the others look bad. In the end, Penny tells Willona that she is the one who burned the couch and the flashback shows how she tried a cigarette and drops it into the couch when JJ says that he did not like smokers.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> episode "The Rashomon Job" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>: a news broadcast on a famous antique dagger leads Sophie, Eliot, Hardison and Parker to realize that they were <em>all</em> at the museum on the night it was stolen five years earlier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as they each recount their version of events, and their recollections of each other on the night in question are somewhat skewed (Hardison seems to remember "Dr." Eliot as a psychopathic killer, and no one is able to get Sophie's accent straight), but they all ultimately agree on the sequence of events, and in the end, none of them came away with the dagger. Nate then reveals that <em>he</em> was there on the night in question as an investigator for the insurance company; the dagger literally fell into his hands by accident, and it provided the evidence he needed to prove that the museum owner was committing insurance fraud. The dagger had been <em>reported</em> stolen so the fence he had been using wouldn't spook and run. (He also depicts the tenacious security chief who threatened to bring the Leverage crew's efforts to ruin as actually a lovestruck buffoon upset with himself that he missed his chance to confess his feelings to the disguised Sophie, but it's implied that this is in reaction to Sophie claiming the man might have been even smarter than Nate himself; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Nate's version of the events is "about 80% accurate.") <br/><br/>One twist used in this version is that the actor playing each character doesn't appear in any of the retellings until that character tells his or her version of events. So, for example, there's a blonde waitress who appears in every version of the story who turns out to be Parker, but before Parker tells her version the waitress isn't played by Beth Riesgraf. Nate also manages to spin the fact that they all foiled each other as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about how his crew is better working with one another than against, as the team was starting to crack under the larger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>.
<ul><li> The series finale "The Long Goodbye Job," although it's not made immediately obvious to the audience, makes use of a similar structure. It opens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a> with Nate in custody after a job gone wrong; the first version shown is Nate's explanation of what happened. The woman he's telling the story to does not believe he's telling the truth, and presents a second version, before a final reveal shows what really happened <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and that almost everything about Nate's original version of the story was a lie and the job is still in progress</span>. Like "The Rashomon Job," this episode also employs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastAsAMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastAsAMask">Cast as a Mask</a> to hide things from the audience, in this case <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">obscuring Sophie and Nate's particular roles in the con</span>.

While we figure out what more or less actually happened, several minor points are left unclear.

Each version of the story makes Dee out to be more and more bird-like (she was dressed as an angel but everyone thought she was dressed as a bird), culminating in Mac's story, where she's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">replaced by a live ostrich.</a>

In Raven's story, she's an absolutely perfect, kind, calm person while Cory is a horrible delinquent who throws candy, purposely sprays juice on Raven's shirt, pulls away from Raven as she hugs him, ripping his shirt, and ends up smashing the portrait over Raven's head out of malice. In Cory's version, Raven's an evil monstrosity while he's a perfect angel, and everything he did was in self-defense or Raven attacking him. Larry comes in and tells the real truth: a trophy falls onto the juice and stains Raven's shirt, Larry opens the bag of marshmallows badly and it explodes, Cory's shirt gets snagged on a hook, and Raven slips, causing the portrait to fall and Cory catches it. When Raven stands up, her head goes right through the picture.

During the visit Nancy, who had been a cheerleader in high school, was asked to perform an old routine. When analyzing the argument later, in Elliot's flashback, Nancy was being blatantly sexual toward Michael while performing the cheer. In Nancy's flashback, when Elliot led her by the arm toward the door, he was brutally grabbing her, twisting her arm. Neither of those things had actually happened during the original scene.

What differs mainly is the tone, mood, and timing of the conversation, indicating different motives.
</li><li> The kids' series <em>Wimzie's House</em> uses this to teach kids that no one can remember something exactly as it was, as people tend to have bias or remember facts wrong, especially if it's over something like "whose fault it is".

Josh remembers Drake as an unfriendly jerk who let a bunch of girls cut in line, deliberately bought the last foam finger to prevent him from buying it, and then thumped him over the head with it. Drake remembers Josh as an obnoxious jerk who accosted Drake for letting a dying British orphan cut in line and then tackled him for buying the last foam finger. Near the end, Megan brings in the guy who sold them the foam finger to tell them the real story: Drake and Josh got along really well when they met, allowed a couple girls to cut in line, and there were no hard feelings when Drake bought the last foam finger. But Josh tackled Drake, thinking he had thumped him over the head, not knowing it was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a toddler-aged Megan who threw a cookie at his head.</span>

For instance, during Noah and Helen's divorce mediation, Noah remembers showing up in a proper suit, the divorce lawyer she hired being a goofball, and his wife being cold, spiteful, and mostly haggling over assets. Helen remembers Noah showing up in a leather jacket, the divorce lawyer she hired being extremely serious, and her husband being rude, crass and making unrealistic demands for joint custody.

<ul><li> In "What Really Happened," a woman goes on trial for the murder of her husband. When her mother-in-law testifies, she describes two events that make the woman appear to be cheating and not caring at all that she was spending extravagantly, but when the woman testifies, she is much more sympathetic. She says she wasn't having an affair, and when she realized how much money she had spent she was ashamed and apologetic.
</li><li> In "I Saw the Whole Thing" multiple witnesses testifiy how they saw the defendant fail to stop his sports car at a stop sign, hit a motorcyclist and then left the accident scene. One witness is revealed to be an alcoholic who was drunk at the time of the accident and really did not see what happened. A woman is revealed to have been distracted because her date was late and thus she did not really see anything and was just parroting what other people said happened. A seemingly reliable retired army colonel is revealed to have a strong bias against people driving sports cars because his son was struck and killed by a sports car. The driver of the car behind the sports car insists that the sports car did not stop but is proven to be confused about his own actions at the time. In the end another witness comes forward who states that he saw the accident from a different angle and that the sports car stopped and it was the motorcycle who was going too fast and failed to stop. After the driver is acquited, he reveals to his friend that he has no idea what really happened since he was not driving the car. His pregnant wife was and she went into labor soon after she drove home from the accident scene. It was a very difficult birth and she was still bedridden in the hospital so he confesed to being the driver to spare her the stress of being arrested. None of the witnesses actually looked at who was driving and simply assumed that it was a man.

It turns out the friction stems from an event several years ago when McCall returned from a training session. She recalls him as being completely uncaring that she was back, being too preoccupied with his replacement partner to even acknowledge her, while he recalls himself and the other woman as being perfectly polite while she was incredibly rude to them.

</li><li> Another version where we never see the incident in question on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine">Strong Medicine</a></em> when Lu and her accused rapist testify before the grand jury. She describes them having a nice evening at a reception to celebrate his appointment as Chief of Surgery (they're both doctors at the same hospital), him offering her a ride home when her car broke down, escorting her to her apartment, kissing her, then refusing to stop even though she repeatedly told him "no". In his version, it's she who kissed him and he insists that she said "no" and "stop" in a playful, flirtatious manner, indicating that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMeansYes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMeansYes">she really meant yes</a>.

His date's version of events depicts them struggling and him throwing her down on the bed, while in his, not only was the encounter consensual, <em>she</em> was the aggressive one who <em>pulled</em> him on to the bed. (She later recants after admitting that she never outright told him "no". Additionally, it's likely that she was just angry upon learning that he was cheating on his girlfriend with her).
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFamousJettJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFamousJettJackson">The Famous Jett Jackson</a></em> opens with Jett, J.B., Kayla, and Booker having foiled a bank robbery. Each gives testimony painting themselves as a perfect, shining hero, and the other three as hopelessly incompetent, much to each other's irritation (and the amusement of the robbers listening from their cell). They also disagree strenuously on whether the male robber's name is Larry, Harry, or Barry. In an interesting take on this trope, at the end of the episode, it's revealed that parts of <em>all</em> of their versions were true...except for the male robber's name, which turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sylvester</span>.

He talks about his life and about his friendship with Doc Holiday. When talking about the Fight at the OK Corral, he mentions that Doc was the one who fired the first shot and started the fight. Doc is insulted by this statement since it is an elment of pride for him that on that day he was acting as a lawman and only fired after being fired upon. Wynonna lampshades the fact that people's recollections change over time and over the years they start to remember things differently than they really happened. However, she nevers says which version of events she actually believes. As Wyatt's descendant, she does not have a good opinion of her ancestor but she also knows that Doc has a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a>.

At the end of the three interviews, the Inspector recounts how, thanks to their testimony, the police are now searching for "a 67 dwarf, aged between 15 and 50, white male with oriental features, whos as black as newgates lockup". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The trope is subverted as it later turns out that all 3 of them were lying, and even when Del admits to being the actual culprit it's hard to say whether or not he's telling the truth or lying further just to upset the Inspector.</span>

<ul><li> From the Loyalists' point of view, the Fallen betrayed their Primarch Lion El'Johnson, and the Emperor, by staging a Traitor rebellion on their home planet while Loyalists were away fighting in the Horus Heresy. Having come home, El'Johnson was furious at seeing his planet seized from him, by his own forces no less, and bombed them into submission before a freak warp storm sparked into existence (probably sent from the Traitor's daemonic masters), and destroyed the besieged planet and whisked the surviving away.
</li><li> In the other version, some of the Fallen claim that they uncovered evidence that their Primarch wasn't as loyal to the Emperor as he appeared, and was deliberately holding back his forces to join the winning the side. The Fallen were then subsequently attacked and nearly exterminated in order to keep them quiet. The freak warp storm rose up, perhaps by chance or divine intervention, and saved the lives of the true loyalists.
</li><li> The novel <em>Fallen Anges</em> just makes things even more confusing.

After its dedication ceremony, <em>something</em> happened between them. Hilde says Solness basically made out with her; Solness says he doesn't remember anything like that happening.

Launcelot, Shylock's servant, complains to his father that he's so starved in Shylock's service that his ribs are visible. However, Launcelot just spent the whole scene practicing deceptions on his father's blindness—which means that nothing he says about his appearance can really be trusted. (This is open to interpretation, since actors of all sizes have played Launcelot over the years—but even if he <em>is</em> skinny, you could chalk that up to a high metabolism.) The way Shylock tells it, Launcelot is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">"huge feeder"</a> who was eating him out of house and home. Of course, Shylock is a miser, so he can't really be trusted either. And so it goes... Bear in mind that it is likely that Shakespeare himself cast <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kempe">William Kempe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the role, who, shall we say, was not thin (he probably also played Falstaff); of course, which actor played which part in the original productions of Shakespeare's plays is not known for certain.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JerseyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JerseyBoys">Jersey Boys</a></em> features a rotating POV between the members of the Four Seasons and this occurs as a result. A few examples:

By the time the player arrives on the scene, a good amount of the story has already happened, and the only way to learn all of it is to play every faction's storyline... But since you can only play one faction per playthrough, the only way to learn the full story is through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a> where the player chose different paths, resulting in wildly different outcomes and effectively making <em>the player</em> have different accounts of the backstory.

<ul><li> <em>Override</em> (Nova's predecessor in the series) has a more standard version — though in a twist it isn't apparent in the game itself, and it took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to reveal it.

Information about the setting's backstory varies wildly depending on which route you're playing. However, adding up all three routes together reveals the same events happened the same way. Any inconsistencies results from characters not having the full story themselves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricalTruth">Metaphorical Truth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">Self-Serving Memory</a>, or plain having a vested interest in distorting events.

Both explain the same events that occurred over the course of the game (that is, the events you're playing), but each has considerable conflicts in the other's story, something Inspector Voltaire tries to press The Pickpocket on during interrogation. Made worse by The Lookout's prologues; while her stories take place before The Locksmith's and The Pickpocket's story, they still have unresolved discrepancies<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, most important of which being how she claims The Cleaner is still on the loose, when the end of the Pickpocket's story shows he (as The Hacker) was captured with the rest of the crew</span>.

</li><li> One occurrence happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> during the judge quest in Charwood. You are asked to find out what really happened that fateful night the children were murdered. Both lords, Jhareg and Kharlat, will tell slanted accounts of the event absolving themselves of the crime and blaming the other fully, unless you have found their respective diary, which lets you force them into telling the truth, that they were guilty in part of the crime. However, to find the real truth, you must force a confession from the demon who manipulated them both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em> toys with this. The game has five separate main characters who interact at various points throughout the game. That said, the game's presentation of events does not change with a different character, but in learning their story you often discover reasons for seemingly inexplicable actions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em>, the player can experience the first half of the story from one of the two main characters' perspectives and then play through the other character's account of the same events.

To further confuse matters, each side's starting experience has the other just generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">getting in the way out of sheer cussedness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">brainlessness</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em> is becoming this as the DLC Campaigns are released. While Shovel Knight's own story is a straightforward heroic journey to defeat the Order of No Quarter and the Enchantress, the three other Campaigns seem to tell the same story, but from other perspectives.

It also reveals certain unexplained parts of the the main game as the results of Plague Knight's doing.
<ul><li> One hint that Plague Knight might not be telling the whole truth about what happened lies in his fight against Shovel Knight—who's using relics he could not have had at that point in the course of normal gameplay.

It has six different main storylines which intersect every so often, and at every intersection point the dialogue is slightly different between the versions used in each character's story. Sometimes this is used more like other examples, in which multiple characters are present at the same event, and whichever character you're playing as ends up being the one to take charge. (Example of this: The battle against E-102 Gamma. In Sonic and Tails' storylines, the character you're playing as is about to beat Gamma but Amy steps in to stop him. In Gamma's storyline, Gamma is about to beat Sonic but Amy stops <em>him</em> instead. Amy's storyline goes with Sonic' interpretation of events, but with Gamma still holding ground beforehand.)

You actually have no choice as to which group you go with — if you chose Rand at the start, you get the "strike out on your own" group, while Setsuko gets the "join ZAFT" route. There's even a route split inside that split!
<ul><li> What makes it an example - as well as interesting - is that soon after you split you start getting odd accounts of the other side being needlessly violent - killing, destroying, and generally being evil. In Mission 39, both sides collide into one massive fight, the aftermath of which having your team realize that BOTH accounts they heard were false - they were both being manipulated into fighting the other (Incidentally, the main reason they realize this is due to timely intervention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3">Banjo Haran</a>, who managed to not only save both teams from destroying each other but also freed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss">Orson</a> from his somewhat-captivity.

</li><li> <em>Scarlet Weather Rhapsody</em> is built around this, where playing different characters is not mutually exclusive plotlines, but apparently sequential plots that merely repeat similar battles over and over. It is because Tenshi seemingly goes out of her way to repeatedly get defeated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No Holds Barred Beatdowns</a> that she is often called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">masochist</a>.

After asking some NPCs about it, you play through three reenactments of their stories: a dwarf claims that he punched his way through a rain of burning boulders to sock Deathwing right in the face, but a gnome interrupts and describes how he used a device to make himself big enough to snatch the dragon out of the sky and hurl him all the way to Kalimdor. And then an orc explains that he was showing off his motorcycle to a bunch of lovely ladies (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">and a blood elf</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">male</a>) when the dragon arrived, so he rode his <em>flying motorbike</em> to the top of a mesa to duel Deathwing in a knife fight, at which point the other characters interrupt and it all dissolves into chaos.

<ul><li> Oni explains the details in a storyteller-like manner, going so far as to give colorful names to various LEGION troops (i.e: Ivory Eagle, Serpent Devils, etc.), which Persephone quips that it has "the flavor of a third-rate martial arts movie." She asks about the weapon they were sent to retrieve, and Oni said there was no weapon.
</li><li> Kingpin's account is more ridiculous than the one above: once entering the lair, he tells Persephone they went in guns blazing, then going through hallways and into a room with ten robots... which he then change to two when Persephone presses him on the matter, but described them as if they were "juicin'." Persephone asks him about the weapon, Kingpin tells her the robots were the weapon, but they had to destroy them.
</li><li> Persephone calls in Scheherazade, expecting a more realistic recall of the mission. Scheherazade tell her that the squad entered the lair with absolute stealth, while in game, Oni informs the squad they had tripped a silent alarm, prompting Kingpin to ask him how he could know about it. Scheherazade continues on about them becoming "one with the darkness", even though there was a lot of shooting involved. After said shooting, they find what they were meant to retrieve in a box... which was empty, much to Persephone's chagrin. Scherazade explains that the weapon is safe in her possession, adding that she had developed an "emotional attachment" to it. Persephone tells her that she trusts her judgement and warns her not to make her regret it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17">Ever17</a></em> has two protagonists, The Kid and Takeshi.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> bases itself off this trope.

<ul><li> Strong Bad claims he cut the hole in the couch to hide his "Aztec gold", but had to close it up again when he unleashed "a stench of biblical proportions".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Exiern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Exiern">Exiern</a></em> has a sequence where the characters are visiting Tiffany's former village, and Peonie, Denver and Niels hear three conflicting accounts from the villagers on who killed her parents and the reason for her exile.

A good example is what happened the night that Solange sicced hitmen on some of the main characters.

In a series of flashbacks, it shows that <em>all</em> of the protagonists had done something that could have possibly crashed the ship, from distracting the pilot to accidentally shutting down the engines. This throws up the question of which one of them caused the crash, or if it was all of their combined efforts that did it. Finally, it's revealed later that an alien tractor beam forcibly pulled the ship to the planet.
</li><li> The Indian web series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PermanentRoommates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PermanentRoommates">Permanent Roommates</a></em> had an episode called "The Memories", where Mikesh, Tanya, and Purushottam tell Dinesh about an event that resulted in them losing their baby's first sonogram. Each person has a different account of the story, all glorifying the narrator. At the end of the episode, the sonogram is returned, and they try to make a new, happy memory together.
</li><li> In the first season of the non-fiction podcast <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Serial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Serial">Serial</a></em>, there are many testimonies about many events related to the murder, from people whose proximity to the case ranges from "best friends with the prime suspect" to "a random guy who claims to have discovered the victim's body during a potty break". Almost nobody's story completely agrees with the others, or with all of the known facts. Even people who are supposed to be on the same side, and have no apparent reason to lie or hide anything, can't seem to agree on fairly large details that should be very memorable, such as whether Adnan and his ex-girlfriend were on good terms between the breakup and the murder. People who claim to remember an event very clearly are equally confident in their conflicting versions of events  one is adamant that Person X was present at a gathering, the other is equally adamant that Person X wasn't there. It was bad enough during the initial investigation, which took place only weeks after the murder; it's even worse during the podcast's investigation years later, where some people's stories don't even agree with their <em>original</em> stories from years ago. Hell, even during the original investigation, a witness gave two testimonies that didn't line up with each other on several crucial points  proving that you really <em>can</em> end up with more stories than witnesses.
<ul><li> This also crops up in a related non-fiction podcast, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/STown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/STown">S-Town</a></em>. For one thing, it starts out with John B. McLemore asking Brian Reed to investigate a murder that was being covered up. He heard about this murder from multiple sources (including the perpetrator himself, who bragged about it afterwards), and heard the perpetrator's father discussing it on the phone when he thought he was alone. Then it turns out the murder never happened  the supposed victim is still alive and well. So how did multiple people come to think he'd been murdered, and what did John hear that guy talking about on the phone? Later on, while Brian is investigating a list of contacts, and wonders why Faye Gamble (the town clerk) contacted people lower on the list sooner than the people at the very top, she claims she tried to get in touch with them but got no response, while the contacts themselves claim that they never heard from her at all. Also, at one point someone claims that Faye told them she never spoke to Brian; but according to Faye, she never said anything of the sort.

He remembers shutting off the toaster oven, but accidentally left the regular oven on after using it to toast marshmallows. He also mentions that he saw Dale at the back of the fire truck fiddling with the air tanks. Dale then admits that he saw Hank's tank was low on air and swapped it with his own, because he knew Hank was the only competent one of the bunch and would need all the air he could get in order to save the other three when they inevitably screwed up.
</li><li> In Hank's version, all of them (himself included) are depicted as children doing their usual things, but "age up" to responsible adults when the alarm bell rings. He remembers personally taking care of the cigarette, oven, and tanning lamp before leaving, but then realizes the fire must have been caused by a faulty Alamo beer sign owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedFallGuyGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedFallGuyGambit">the recently-deceased Chet Elderson</a>.

Both try to make themselves look innocent and the other look rotten. In the end, Karen — Plankton's computer &amp; wife — shows footage of what actually happened.
<ul><li> In Krabs' version, the falling out was due to Plankton going mad with the power being the only decent burger joint in town gave him over the other kids, prompting a fight that resulted in the formula torn in half and Plankton kicking Krabs out with a booby trap.
</li><li> In Plankton's version, the falling out was due to Krabs being overcome with greed, and Plankton's the one to get kicked out. He also reveals that his half of the recipe read 'a ton of chum'.
</li><li> And finally, according to Karen (who was a security system at that time), the fight was started when Plankton and Krabs' first and only customer dies of apparent food poisoning. Nobody is kicked out, rather Plankton storms out and slams the door, resulting in various unspecified ingredients falling into the patty mix, creating the present Krabby Patty formula (the old formula is apparently the slop sold at the Chum Bucket).

What makes this one interesting is that the story is the same — Jon takes Garfield out for yogurt, finds it too expensive, Jon heads home and decides to make yogurt himself, Garfield interferes while Jon leaves to answer the door, and things go out of control. The only difference is that each narrator makes himself out to be a perfect angel while depicting the other as a complete jerk. Odie's refusal to answer seems to hint that both were at fault.

Everyone dismisses this story, with Grim saying "Oh please, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">that didn't even look like us</a>". Irwin is amazed at the stories but then says he was asking how they ended up hanging on the rope. It acts like a lead in to another Rashomon-style story, but the episode ends as they fall and get eaten by the monster they're hanging over.
</li><li> A variation in the pseudo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PicnicEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PicnicEpisode">Picnic Episode</a> has Billy preparing food to leave for it, though each other character in the house (Grim, Mandy, and Billy's mom) rejects his idea by recounting what happened last time: Billy, Mandy, and Grim have their picnic, Billy asks for the egg salad, then a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti">sasquatch</a> jumps out from a bush and runs off with the screaming Billy. Billy's dad then comes in, but his recounting shows him putting on the sasquatch costume before jumping out.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the "Slappy Squirrel" shorts on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em>, Slappy is on trial for the assault of her perennial nemesis Walter Wolf. The three witnesses called are Slappy's nephew Skippy (who portrays Slappy as an angelic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a> and Walter as a horrible monster), Walter (who portrays himself as an angelic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a> and Slappy as an evil, child-hating hag), and Slappy (who freely confesses to not only the initial accusation but a lot more screwball antics, including blowing the plaintiff to smithereens).
</li><li> In the episode from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a></em>, "Every Chipmunk Tells a Story", each chipmunk has a different version of how Dave's piano got destroyed and had instant pudding in it. Alvin, Simon, and Theodore naturally each paint themselves as an innocent, unwilling victim of the situation while their two respective siblings are portrayed as more bullying figures. The whole truth of what happened is never revealed.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfHeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfHeMan">The New Adventures of He-Man</a></em> revolves around the Battle of the Quagmi Swamp. Good guys Hydron and Flipshot, as well as bad guys Flogg and Slushhead, each have their own version of what happened during the battle. Naturally, in every case, the one telling their version exaggerates his role and makes himself look like the hero. Unlike a lot of examples (but like <em>Rashomon</em>), the real events are never revealed, and the audience has to draw their own conclusions regarding what parts of whose story are true.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampCandy">Camp Candy</a></em> combined this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a> in the episode titled "Dear Mom and Dad". The episode opens with John putting out a fire where the mess hall used to be and openly wondering what happened. We then see one of the campers writing a note to her parents taking the blame for the fire and explaining why she's leaving the camp. We then see another camper doing the same while exonerating the previous camper. This goes on until John finds them all waiting for the bus to take them home and explains that he saw and fixed all their mistakes. His assistant finally reveals what really happened: a meteorite hit the gas line.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero</a></em> episode "Not a Ghost of a Chance" provides a two-fer. In the main storyline, the Joes (Hawk and Lady Jaye) and Cobra (Cobra Commander, Serpentor, and Dr. Mindbender) exchange verbal blows on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews">Twenty Questions</a></em> regarding the loss of one of two prototype stealth bombers (the Joes say Cobra shot it down, the snakes say nuh-uh). At the same time, while he's searching for the bomber's crew, Flint verbally grouses over some earlier perceived fraternization between Lady Jaye and the bomber's pilot. As it turned out, Cobra did shoot down the plane (and tries to go after the second prototype as well), and the pilot (an old flight school buddy of Lady Jaye's) was just asking her to a wallpapering party along with a lot of other friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad">Time Squad</a></em>: "A Thrilla at Attila's" finds the trio filing a somewhat botched mission rehabilitating a not-so-threatening Attila the Hun (they succeeded, but got beat up in the process). Larry's account depicts Tuddrussel as a barely articulate caveman and Otto endlessly babbling historical trivia, while Tuddrussel's has Larry as a terrified sissy (complete with tutu) and Otto as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Robin</a>. Both claim someone else provoked the Huns to attack after they were trained (Otto in Larry's and Larry in Tuddrussel's) and cast themselves as the hero who fought them off. Only Otto's is the truth: he managed to pep talk Attila into action after Larry and Tuddrussel's training failed, and the two were beaten up after they laughed at him. Unfortunately, Otto's the only one who's not an official Time Force member, so his opinion doesn't count, and Larry and Tuddrussel make the report a fusion of their own stories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>: "The Trial" has playground rat Randall accusing Spinelli of beaning him with a rock during a dirt clod war. The kids hold a trial and Randall, Mikey and Spinelli are called to testify. Randall's version depicts him as an ultimate badass winning the war single-handed while Spinelli is a coward, hitting kids who have already been hit by dirt clods and beaning Randall with the rock because he is her quote "Moral and physical superior." Mikey's version portrays Spinelli as a battlefield angel bringing medical attention to injured kids. Randall hits her with a dirt clod during time-out and she runs off screaming that she's going to cream him. Spinelli tells the truth, that she had Randall at her mercy, while holding a dirt clod not a rock, and that she forgot all about him while rescuing Ms. Finster's cat from a tree. It turns out that Randall actually hit himself with the rock and lied to get back at Spinelli for earning Ms. Finster's approval for this act. King Bob dismisses the charges against Spinelli and orders that Randall be given her punishment of a swirly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EndangeredSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EndangeredSpecies">Endangered Species</a></em>: In "Tub of Troubles", Merl, Pickle and Gull each relate their version of a disaster that happened in the tub ruining bath time. Merl's involves pirates, Pickle's in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> style action film, and Gull's is part fairy tale and part spring break story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>: Over the course of the episode "Victor. Echo. November.", three different characters recount the tale of how Phantom Limb made his arms and legs invisible. It is completely different every time, though each also involves Billy "Quizboy" Whelan and how he himself ended up with a cybernetic arm. At the end of the episode, Dr. Venture even asks Billy directly about his arm; he replies, "That's an excellent question. I have no idea." The following season, the true story is told in flashback. It turns out everyone was wrong, though each story had a grain of truth (except Hank's, which was completely off the wall). Oddly enough, Billy's claim not to know his own story was also true.
<ul><li> "Operation P.R.O.M." features the revelation that Dr. Venture's nickname is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicSutra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicSutra">a horribly disgusting sex act</a>. Despite this, pretty much everybody has a different, lengthy definition of what constitutes a "Rusty Venture", but the descriptions have enough common elements (pretty much all of them involve some variety of scat) that it seems like they could have come from a single source. The creators have suggested that there isn't a "real answer"; the important part is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">a show about a little boy having adventures</a> somehow originated a sex move so gross and so legendary that its details are lost to myth. For their part, the fanbase seems to have decided that Brock's definition ("the name for when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">you jerk off so much</a>, your dick gets all red and sore") sounds like the most fitting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Doc.</a>

Twilight interviews them separately to find out what happened. Rarity claims Applejack came down with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanMadness">Ocean Madness</a> and steered the boat straight into a storm. Pinkie Pie claims that Rarity acted like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> at the worst possible time, preventing Applejack from steering them out of the storm. And Applejack claims that she was distracted from steering the ship by Pinkie's over-the-top party antics. The truth isn't directly shown, but by cross-referencing all three stories, Twilight determines that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all three of them are exaggerating how bad the storm was, and it wasn't anyone's fault for sinking the boat—a wild bunyip did that.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012">Littlest Pet Shop</a></em> with the episode "Sunil's Sick Day" where Sunil and Vinnie tell their own side of the story of a falling out they had. Sunil was mad at Vinnie for breaking his wand while Vinnie was mad at Sunil for stealing his tapshoes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the end Sunil's wand turns out to be a trick wand while Minka had Vinnie's tapshoes all along.</span>
</li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Downtown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Downtown">Downtown</a></em> features this when Chaka and Mecca remember when they first met Matt and Fruity, and vice versa. All we really know for sure is that they were all in the park and Chaka was dancing in the fountain:
<ul><li> Chaka remembers herself as a voluptuous dancer that had the attention of every guy in the park, and that Matt and Fruity were lanky nerds.
</li><li> Fruity remembers himself as a fit, confident skater, and Chaka as a plain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">flat</a> girl.
</li></ul></li><li> Episode "Between Friends" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Babar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Babar">Babar</a></em> has Celeste and Zephir suing each other after a road accident between Celeste's car and Zephir's bike going into Court with Babar as judge. They both say their own versions Rashomon-style portraying the other as a crazy driver and themselves as the slow-pacing polite and responsable driver.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShimmerAndShine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShimmerAndShine">Shimmer and Shine</a></em>: In "Dragon Tales", Zeta tells Leah, Shimmer and Shine about the day she met her pet dragon Nazboo. Then Nazboo tells his side <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a.k.a. the truth</span>. In Zeta's version, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the dragons' homeland, Manetikar, is described as a dark and horrible place where the big dragons used to pick on Nazboo until Zeta effortless defeated them and decided to pick Nazboo as her pet instead of a big dragon as she originally intended because she couldn't leave him alone with the bully dragons she didn't take in. Zeta also introduced Nazboo to the "tummy rub"</span>. In Nazboo's version, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Manetikar is a light and beautiful place where the big dragons are kind and Zeta's attempt to tame one of them ended with her bring dragged around and she decided to settle for Nazboo, who already knew of "tummy rub".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmperorsNewSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmperorsNewSchool">The Emperor's New School</a></em> had an episode where Kuzco is accused of stealing a valuable mask he was supposed to be guarding. The events of the theft get told from the point of view of different characters, with each sequence being animated in the current narrator's doodling style. Kuzco is obviously an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> who is tells a lot of lies to make himself sound better, and he claims that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> of their religion came in and took the mask, which nobody believes. The events are shown again from the perspective of Kronk, Malina, and Yzma. Kronk is more honest than Kuzco and spends too much time talking about unimportant details. Kronk was ordered by Yzma to steal the mask and frame Kuzco for it but forgot to do it. Malina's story is cut short by her skipping to the part where she accuses Yzma of being the thief though she didn't actually see it happen. Yzma tells a ton of lies about what she was doing on the night of the theft. It is then revealed there was actually another security guard watching the mask who claims that Kuzco really was telling the truth about a god taking the mask. Then the god shows up and reveals himself to be Pacha in a costume, who then explains why he took the mask.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks">Storm Hawks</a></em> had an episode where each member of the crew tell completely different stories about how they got trapped in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a>, with each of them claiming it is their own fault and they were lured in by something that they desire, causing all of them to get trapped. The improbability of the conflicting stories makes them realize that they actually have been trapped by a monster with illusion powers.

<ul><li> The term <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect">Rashomon Effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a similar meaning was coined by anthropologists no later than in late 1970s and possibly even in mid-60s.
</li><li> The Rashomon Effect causes obvious problems in court. In a 2014 Canadian case, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://canlii.ca/t/gdwlk">R. v. Pashahzahiri<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>,</em> the judge specifically mentions both the film and the effect in deciding a case in which different witnesses in the same room<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3b0id');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3b0id" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3b0id');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(as it turns out, <em>the very same courtroom in which the case was tried</em> — the case concerned threats allegedly uttered during a different trial)</span> testified variously that the accused threatened someone loudly in English, muttered something indiscernable in a foreign language, or said nothing at all.
</li><li> Due to the unreliability of human memory, the way that preconceived notions can affect one's interpretation of a situation, and plain old dishonesty, pretty much any attempt to reconstruct a complex event using only eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence is likely to suffer from this  thus the saying about how 12 witnesses will give 13 different stories. This is frequently demonstrated in investigative journalism and crime documentaries, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Serial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Serial">Serial</a></em> (see above under Web Original) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles">Forensic Files</a></em>.
