</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">Wrong</a>.
Increasingly common in media are situations where a divorced couple still get along for the most part, and in many cases still care about each other even though they're no longer together. In many cases the divorce happened because of distance, circumstance or the simple fact that people change rather than infidelity, betrayal or other serious problems, and the fact that they got divorced is treated as a fact of life rather than due to a flaw in the people. Both parties also generally agree that it was for the best for both of them. It's also pretty common for couples who broke up because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Incompatible Orientation</a> or who were each other's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastHetRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastHetRomance">Last Het Romance</a> to end up this way.
</p><p>If there are children from the marriage they are shared without much complaint, and the amicability of the parents can often be interpreted as being partly for their sake. As such, this tends to show up in children's cartoons, perhaps as an attempt to counter the stereotype of the children of divorced parents being largely unhappy. May involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisitByDivorcedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisitByDivorcedDad">Visit by Divorced Dad</a> that will usually go well, and for the most part any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict">Divorce Assets Conflicts</a> are avoided or settled reasonably.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The increase in this trope can be attributed in the dramatic shift in divorce rates and public perception of those who have gone through with divorces in the last 50 years (i.e. between the 1950s and the start of the 21st century). While divorce used to be scandalous, it's now a fairly common occurrence, and this trope reflects the view that it's just a fact of life that doesn't have to permanently poison a relationship. Sometimes it even results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceIsTemporary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceIsTemporary">Divorce Is Temporary</a>, though this is less common in more realistic works and those aimed at children due to an unrealistic message ("wish hard enough and your parents will get back together!").

This is something that took time, as their initial feelings were far more bitter, but they eventually realized that despite their attraction to one another they were simply too different to function as a stable couple, and rather than raise a child in that environment they decided to split up to give her a life where her parents weren't constantly fighting. This makes it a case where the split was mainly for the <em>child's</em> benefit.

Yoshino and Hachiken get along rather well, though they aren't particularly close, and their romantic involvement only ever existed in Tokiwa's overactive imagination. That doesn't stop anyone, <em>including Hachiken and Yoshino</em>, from acting like they were dating and broke up, but are still on good terms.

Their marriage clearly failed, and it didn't seem like it was amicable at first, but by the time of the show, the two are capable of being civil with each other when they meet again in probably the first time since their divorce, when both get embroiled in the Chosen Children's war against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Vamdemon</a> in Odaiba.

The impression being given is that while the two still do care for each other, actually getting back together just isn't in the cards. This certainly helps when both are in likely frequent contact with each other as part of the Children's support group in the real world by the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">the sequel</a>.

Hunter predicted that a suspect wouldn't have a gun, and thus urged his team to make the arrest without waiting for backup. He turned out to be wrong, and the killer shot him in the knee, crippling him, before gunning down his father-in-law; in response, Ashley filed for divorce and he was let go from the FBI. It was clear that Hunter still very much loved her and regretted his mistake, but he sadly accepted that she would likely never forgive him and was trying to move on with his life. Ashley's thoughts on Hunter after the divorce were only told by Hunter's account, but it's clear she was angry and bitter at Hunter for his mistake that cost her father's life. When Ashley learns that Hunter transformed into Zoom, she left the FBI to come to Keystone City to take over his former spot as the local metahuman profiler to help reform him. She makes it clear that she still loves Hunter, regrets leaving him, and swore that she'll help him and never leave him again. It very clear that they have lingering feelings for each other.

</li><li> In <em>After Her</em> by Joyce Maynard, Rachel and Patti's mother and father divorced when the two were young children, but their father continued to play an active role in their lives. In this case the split was because their parents married young and eventually realized that they simply didn't work as a couple and the stress from his job as a police detective pushed them apart. He admits that he makes a better friend to their mother and confides in her when his investigation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> puts extreme pressure on him, and it's indicated that their mother knew about him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having another child with another woman</span> after the divorce but agreed not to tell Rachel and Patti because it would upset them.

They both end up canceling them to spend the evening with each other watching a movie, both unaware that they were set up together. Their friends who set them up were unaware of their past relationship.
</li><li> This relationship was also subjected to a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> when Martin comments that Lilith was worse than Niles's then-wife Maris.

In early episodes, Lilith's presence was interpreted as being downright demonic (as a play on her name). Also, Frasier and Lilith had just freshly divorced when the show started (on account of her cheating on him after a really subtle relationship decay), while Maris's foibles didn't lead to her and Niles separating until 3 or 4 seasons later; the divorce didn't even come until he discovered she was sleeping with their marriage counselor. After that, she was considered just as screwy as Lilith, if not more so.
<ul><li> This could also come from the fact that while Maris obviously has significant psychological problems (anorexia, surgical addiction, severe phobias, and hypochondria are some of the more easily diagnosed) that she can't help, Lilith is intentionally cruel and cold, to the point that she laughed as Maris read her flowery vows during her and Niles's wedding.
</li></ul></li><li> Even after some point, Niles and Maris begin to fit this trope, when after the divorce and his marriage to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daphne</span>, Maris comes to him for assistance regarding an abusive boyfriend.

This caused New Christine to call off her and Richard's wedding, as she was upset that the two were spending so much time together, even at the wedding.

They are even platonic roommates in seasons 4-7, and Ted has promised to be Robin's best man should she ever get married.
</li><li> This is eventually subverted when they realize that they are <em>too</em> amicable with each other and thus cannot maintain new romantic relationships.

They constantly snipe at each other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">but that's what affection looks like for both of them</a>. It's an atypical example, because they ultimately get back together, live together, and have a child together, but never consider getting remarried. In fact, when they discover that their divorce was never finalized, they both feel so suffocated by the concept that they end up divorcing to <em>save</em> their relationship. They stay together, but are both much happier with the understanding that they don't <em>have</em> to be.

Then she cheated on him with Darnell and Earl ended up raising <em>two</em> kids that weren't his.

A lot of the episodes try to focus on them trying to make this "friendship" workout and to have them not go back to the same dysfunctional cycle that ended their marriage in the first place.

The real Aesop though is that the divorce hasn't affected their relationship with their child rather than each other.

They occasionally bicker, but it's clear to anyone that they're close friends. This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> after there first "real" break up when they treat Sheldon as if he were a child over whom they have shared custody, watching him sleep peacefully after a trip to Disneyland together.
</li><li> Jo and Russ on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>.

They're reasonable but rather curt with each other, and the first time we meet him, Jack wonders why Erin still has her married name "Reagan-Boyle" on her door. She says it's the same reason people who have lost weight keep a "before" picture. Ouch. However, they still trust each other enough that Erin calls Jack to represent her brother Danny after he gets framed.
</li><li> John &amp; Laurie Cooper of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland">Southland</a></em>. His coming out as gay was a major factor in their divorce, but they clearly still love/care for each other.

Even though this sometimes irritates Frank, they still seem quite fond of each other. Part of the equation is that Fay has custody of their son, Frank Jr. Frank's new girlfriend, Joyce Davenport, is also usually on quite friendly terms with Fay, even though she's a rival for Frank's attention.
</li><li> Rose Tyler and Mickey Smith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, though the latter is at first upset when she left him to go with the Doctor but they maintain a friendly relationship afterward.
<ul><li> The 2006 episode "School Reunion" broached the subject, with Mickey referring to former companion Sarah Jane Smith as the Doctor's ex, and the ending of the Doctor's and Sarah Jane's relationship was framed as a form of romance that was forced to end, with the Doctor and Sarah Jane in separate scenes confirming that there was more than just friendship between the two. Despite all of this, the Doctor and Sarah Jane are overjoyed to see each other and are friendly throughout (indeed, their friendship is reignited and continues after this).

To get around their issues, they resort to a <em>lot</em> of snark.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> episode "Mr. Monk and the TV Star", it appears that crime show star Brad Terry and his murdered ex-wife Susan Malloy were this. But, as it turns out, Brad's show <em>Crime Lab SF</em> is about to go into syndication and since he was still married to Susan when the show first began airing, she's entitled by California law to half of his earnings from the reruns. Since Brad doesn't like that part of the agreement, he stabs her while she's doing her yoga workout and makes it seem like she was stabbed by a deranged fan while he was outside talking to paparazzi.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Transparent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Transparent">Transparent</a></em>, Maura and Shelly are on quite good terms with each other.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods">Night in the Woods</a></em>, you find out that Mae briefly dated Cole in high school, but their prom date was a disaster of epic proportions. (It involved her biting him so hard he bled while trying to kiss him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">him nearly choking to death on paper towels while she vomited in the sink</a>.) Mae is understandably anxious about seeing him at a party, but it appears Cole would like to try for this trope with her — he doesn't bring up what happened, and acts warmly towards her when he sees her. Unfortunately, Mae is raging drunk, and begins publicly ranting at him. (And then <em>he</em> apologizes for upsetting her, possibly in hopes of calming her down.) The whole thing ends with Mae puking and swiftly being brought home by Bea, leaving a very confused (and sober) Cole.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4">Spider-Man (PS4)</a></em>, Peter and Mary Jane had broken up six months prior to the start of the game and haven't seen or spoken to each other since. When they do meet up, they are civil enough to have friendly conversation over a meal together. While Peter wants to repair their relationship even if it's just friends, Mary Jane is more hesitant due to the "baggage" from their previous romance. Peter had been under the impression that they broke up because Mary Jane wanted to focus on her career but in reality, Mary Jane felt that Peter's overbearing and overprotective nature made him treat her less than an equal and she couldn't get past that frustration. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They gradually fix their relationship during the game and by the end, they are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> again.</span>

Even though Moxxi is the one who sent you after him (he was holding Athena hostage), she is saddened when he dies and tearfully oversees the funeral arrangements herself. We get a better feel for her relationship with the series' resident arms dealer Marcus, as both characters are still around. Marcus admits that he misses her sometimes, and that he respected the cunning business advice she provided. Moxxi is fond of him, but isn't above snarking that paying his tab in her bar does <em>not</em> constitute alimony.

This is probably because they were friends even before they dated; Gaspar's friend Art, however, thinks it's because Texas doesn't have alimony laws (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">or didn't, as this comic is set in the 80s</a>).

Things got a bit strained between them when she decided to go full-body cyborg (the Commander has always been violently opposed to full body-mods), but that seems to have passed when he realized it was what she genuinely wanted and not some conspiracy from the higher-ups.

They broke up due to two dominant partners being a poor match, and part of the reason they are such great friends now is that they share common interests.

Their breakup was over Branwen moving rather than any issue between them, and they've remained close friends ever since, with Branwen even meeting Davan's new girlfriend, Vanessa, and getting along perfectly well with her, too. It's really showcased during Davan and Vanessa's wedding reception, when Branwen shows up in a t-shirt with "I used to screw the groom" on the front and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">"now I've come for the bride"</a> on the back.

Lois and Ginger can still accept Jonas despite him not always being there, but the divorce has made Carl distant with his father, and this conflict appeared in a few episodes, since he wasn't even around for the first season or two of the show and completely failed to keep up on events with his kids. When he suddenly came into the picture it was as a hesitant, awkward but trying man, and fits with the theory of someone who ran away from a problem but is now trying to fix it, but is aware they don't really deserve a second chance.

By the end of the show, theyre pretty good friends.
</li><li> Mako and Asami eventually gain this type of relationship as well, which is interesting considering that their relationship falls apart over Mako kissing Korra while still being in a relationship with Asami. Asami's main issue with it seems to be that he lied and tried to hide it rather than the fact that it happened, and she notably refuses to blame Korra for what happened, knowing that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">has not been very well socialized</a>.

It's also hinted that Asami and Mako are considering getting back together as well, but ultimately nothing comes of it and they remain apart for the rest of the series.

(Even though he <em>is</em> evil by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">his own admission</a>.) Doofenshmirtz himself is civil around her and Vanessa, but one can tell that he doesn't appreciate her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> attitude and remains a tad bitter:

</div><ul><li> In her first appearance in "Ice Cream, You Scream" Charlene tells Vanessa that "no one's evil" and that their marriage didn't work because they both wanted "different things." ("Was one of those things being evil? 'Cause he's evil.")
</li><li> In the episode "Run Candace, Run", Doof's building is being foreclosed on since he spent his mortgage money on some gargoyles. Despite Charlene being able to lend him the money to cover the cost, he refuses to call and ask her, since she told him gargoyles were a stupid idea. In the end, he does ask her, and she does lend him the money after the obligatory "I told you so."
</li><li> Subverted with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> counterparts in "Tales from The Resistance: Return to the 2nd Dimension"—<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they are in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> and pretending to be divorced, for a number of reasons ranging from protecting Charlene from the law to tax benefits to just preferring to have their space</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Several examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marco and Jackie break up on good terms in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS3E13SophomoreSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS3E13SophomoreSlump">Sophomore Slump</a>", which is confirmed with Jackie's return in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS4E26BrittasTacos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS4E26BrittasTacos">Britta's Tacos</a>".

</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tom and Star break up for the second time</span> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS4E29SadTeenHotline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS4E29SadTeenHotline">Sad Teen Hotline</a>", he's uncertain about whether they can still be friends afterward, feeling like it would hurt too much to still be around her afterward. Especially since part of the reason for the breakup is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tom realized that Star is in love with Marco, who is also Tom's best friend.</span> But ultimately, they do end up remaining friends for the rest of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gwen was able to stay friends with Trent after their break up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> with Duncan.
<ul><li> Things were rather awkward between Gwen and Trent, with her breaking up with him because of a mix of his jealousy of her friendship with Duncan and learning he was throwing the game so she could win. Trent was heartbroken to learn that Gwen asked his team to vote him off and was too heartbroken from their breakup to defend her when the other contestants give her a hard time over their break up. However, when Geoff wants to throw Gwen in a dunk tank full of piranhas, he puts his foot down and tells Geoff that that is enough, he was the one who threw the game, not Gwen, and it was not her fault. Gwen thanks Trent and apologizes to him, with him telling her that they're cool. After that they seem to move on from their break up and become good friends, as the two are seen hanging together or joking with each other during <em>World Tour</em>'s Aftermaths several times.
</li><li> Originally, Gwen had a strong friendship with Duncan that formed into a relationship. However, by the time of <em>All-Stars</em> they're shown to lack chemistry and affection at the start of the season. Eventually, they break up because of a mix of Gwen's attempts to make up with Courtney combined with Duncan's attempts to get Courtney's attention. It's telling that Duncan's more confused than heartbroken regarding the break-up. While she does not bitterly hate Duncan the same way Courtney does, it is clear that the love, friendship, and respect Gwen had for Duncan is gone. Duncan leaves the competition on bad terms with Gwen, as she sarcastically mocks him while he is being escorted away by the police after blowing up Chris' cottage, showing no concern for Duncan's imprisonment.
</li></ul></li><li> Harold and Leshawna as well when the two break up during the <em>Island</em> special. While Harold continues to remain in love with her and constantly tries to win her back, he seems pretty happy with being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a> as well. Similarly, Leshawna, although usually annoyed by Harold's inability to take a hint, does actually care a lot about him and is genuinely touched on occasion by his attempts to impress her (with a few episodes implying she does have some mutual feelings for Harold).
</li></ul></li><li> Tino's mother and father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em>. The main factor of their divorce seems to be that Tino's dad needed to stay on the East Coast for his job.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> tie-in comic notes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> has managed to stay friends with all of his exes (who include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Icon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Icon">Rocket</a>). "That's <em>my</em> superpower."
<ul><li> This is true of his comics character as well. Dick is still friends with Barbara Gordon and Koriand'r.
