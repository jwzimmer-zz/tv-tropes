Very often more evil than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>, Internal Affairs is the true enemy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> and everything s/he stands for, as they're usually on a crusade to get the Cowboy Cop — who they see as being just as bad as, if not worse than, the criminals he pursues — thrown off the force with all due haste.
</p><p>As the Cowboy Cop is most often the hero and a good cop, the cops working for Internal Affairs are therefore often characterized as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">humorless, prissy and self-righteous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey">desk jockeys</a> who have no real understanding of what it's really like out there on the streets — because if they did, then there's no way that they'd get so morally uptight and outraged about the Cowboy Cop's complete ignorance of correct police operating procedure and flagrant disregard for the basic human rights of the suspect. Indeed, a frequent method of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anviliciously</a> highlighting the moral superiority of the Cowboy Cop compared to these cops is to have him or her angrily hiss "What about the <em>victim's</em> rights?" when getting chewed out by Internal Affairs — to which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> will of course have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">no answer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">whatsoever</a>. In these cases, Internal Affairs seems dedicated to promoting a system of justice which actively <em>protects</em> the guilty whilst forcing the innocent to suffer.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>It's not just the Cowboy Cop, though; the entire <em>department</em> seems to loathe the Internal Affairs cops with a passion. This suits the Internal Affairs cops just fine, however, as more often than not they're depicted as complete ball-breaking pricks who aren't interested in being liked by <em>anyone</em>; protecting the integrity of the force is simply more important. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a> often has a grudge against these guys as well, as they often overrule his authority and demand that he force the Cowboy Cop to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnInYourBadge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnInYourBadge">turn in his badge</a>.
</p><p>Another role for Internal Affairs in fiction is to have one of their officers infiltrate a police station undercover with the intent of exposing some form of corruption, only to gradually form friendships (and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interests</a>) with the cops they are meant to be investigating. This can result in all manner of complications and angst galore when the undercover officer's role is finally exposed.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In the most positive portrayals, these are the cops that a cop protagonist can turn to when they see corruption and cannot stop it themselves. At the end, when the hero has proved his allegation, the IA cops will be the ones who come to haul away the crooked cops with the hero cop standing back, regretting such measures were necessary. After all, if they play their cards right they are more the natural enemy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">dirty cops</a> rather than honest ones. Clean ones shouldn't have things to hide.
</p><p>This is, in some ways, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as for obvious reasons there's tension between regular police officers and the regulatory authorities assigned to watch over them in real life (just as tensions exist between police officers and civilians, for much the same reasons). However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> and his supporters tend to forget or overlook the fact that the rules and regulations that Internal Affairs so staunchly uphold exist for a reason. Like them or not, without Internal Affairs keeping the worst excesses of police authority and corruption in check, things wouldn't be very pleasant (in which case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>). Although, interestingly, in real life, the Internal Affairs departments of many countries actually often faces critique for being <em>too lenient</em> on police misconduct, exactly <em>because</em> their ranks are mostly or even entirely made up of police officers, and it is argued by critics that this structure inevitably creates a fundemental conflict of interest as the people supposed to investigate complaints of overreach are not truly capable of being objective towards their fellow cops.
</p><p>Occasionally, this will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> by making Internal Affairs <em>right</em>, and the Cowboy Cop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen">actually deserve</a> having to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnInYourBadge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnInYourBadge">turn in his badge</a>. In rare cases, the protagonists are with IA, in which case they'll probably be wholly in the right, pursuing some genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCops">dirty cops</a> (obstruction from other police then is likely portrayed as very bad).

Although the fluff claims there are inspectors assigned to each Bureau branch and administrated world, we only see one, Verossa Acous, who is in charge of monitoring the Riot Force 6 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>. Unlike most examples, he is on extremely amicable terms with them since he views their commanding officer as a little sister and their sponsors are his older sister, best friend, and best friend's mother.

That doesn't mean they <em>like</em> IAD cops — but IAD are generally shown as honest guys doing an unpleasant job without malice.
<ul><li> The main IA cop featured even goes a bit rogue in one of his investigations. In order to help Detective Allen stay on the force, he surrenders a crucial bit of evidence in his investigation of corrupt CSU Jim Corrigan. He knows that it's better to have Allen on the force than Corrigan off it, and that Corrigan will screw up again.
</li><li> There are enough corrupt IA cops in Gotham that they become a problem in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin Series</a></em> when they clear Detectives Wise and Cavallo of charges after Officer Harper arrests them for murder among other things, though admittedly she was expecting them to get out quickly due to the amount of blackmail material they have on other GCPD officers.

</li><li> In the storyline <em>The Pit</em>, Dredd finds himself in this role, sent to clean up what was at the time the worst sector and the worst branch of the Judges in the city, with the Chief Judge unwilling to trust the local SJS. Needless to say, things improved by the time he left.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers">Powers</a></em>, a rather friendly internal affairs cop begins investigating Deena, easily the more violent of the protagonist duo, about a suspect's death in a hospital that occurred years ago in the comic. Deena's nervous for an entirely different and much more credible reason: she just murdered her ex-boyfriend in a fit of rage after secretly contracting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContagiousPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContagiousPowers">Contagious Powers</a>.

She is portrayed as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, but it's made clear that she acts like that out of frustration that <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Code_of_Silence">she can't even get honest cops to report on the dirty ones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

In the first movie, the D.A takes this role, complete with indignant "what about the rights of that little girl?" demand from Harry. In point of fact, Harry's is probably the trend-setter here.

Stallone also punches him at the end of the movie when the IA cop makes a snide comment over how he'd have handled things a bit differently, but "No hard feelings". Stallone: "Sure. (WHACK!) No hard feelings, Monte."

Even later in the film Danny's ex-cop father returns the money Danny gave him (to pay off some debts to the mob) saying something along the lines of "I might have been dirty but at least I didn't stab my partners in the back." In the end, it turned out that Nick was dirty, but Danny chose to whitewash his report after Nick's death so that he'd be remembered as an honest cop who died in the line of duty.</span>

(In the previous movie, Gordon even said "I'm no rat!" despite his partner blatantly extorting money in front of him, though this may be explained by his weary, "Who's there to rat to?") However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dent turns out to be right all along, and a few of the crooked cops in the Major Crimes Unit lead to Rachel's death, and his own facial scarring.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetKings">Street Kings</a></em>: The first part of the movie makes it look as if the Internal Affairs Department has some kind of personal vendetta against cops who are "only trying to do their jobs". This is subverted when it's revealed that they were totally justified, as the cops they were investigating actually were corrupt.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> movie has a subversion: Lt.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Saw3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Saw3D">Saw 3D</a></em> shows Internal Affairs Detective Matt Gibson (along with his partners Rodgers and Palmer) in a positive light.

<ul><li> Danny, though, has had more run-ins than Mac. In season one, he killed an undercover officer who shot at him, insisting that the guy never ID'd himself as a cop.

Danny was only exonerated because his other bullet was never found, so there wasn't any evidence to move forward.

</li><li> FBI-focused <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em> had a recurring villain in the first two seasons in OPR Agent Fowler <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who turned out to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawmanGoneBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawmanGoneBad">Lawman Gone Bad</a>: his wife was killed and then he killed her assassin, leaving himself open to blackmail by the big bad.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> uses elements of this trope when FBI higher-ups investigate Hotchner's conduct when his ex-wife and son were pursued by an elusive serial killer. Subverted in that, while the head investigator (and Hotchner's boss, Erin Strauss) is dogged in her questioning and rubs all of Hotch's teammates the wrong way, she turns sympathetic when Hotchner himself relates how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his ex-wife had been killed and he'd beaten her murderer to death to save their little boy</span>.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues">Hill Street Blues</a></em>, an IA officer is sent undercover as a secretary to investigate the Hill Street station. The cops uncover her identity and are severely annoyed. Detective Larue also had a few run-ins with them whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">his drinking problem</a> or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> tendencies got the better of him; one story arc involved him getting dropped in the ordure with IA by a supposedly undercover Narcotics officer who'd offered him a bundle of twenties to go away and not blow his cover. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not surprisingly, the drug squad cop turned out to be dirty.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> does this all the time, from individuals sent from the Attorney General's office to moles placed by the White House. Some manage to contribute, most are unhelpful, and some end up being revealed as actually working for corrupt, if not terrorist, interests.
</li><li> Every time that Internal Affairs appears in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> series, they're unhelpful at best. On the other hand, the main characters will occasionally take it upon themselves to play this role if their case leads to a police officer as a suspect.
<ul><li> Season 1's "Poison Ivy" begins with a police shooting, which (in a subversion) is initially cleared by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">Internal Affairs</a>. Greevy and a reluctant Logan aren't so sure, and do their own investigating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> even had an entire episode wherein <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">The Faceless</a> IA bureaucrats got the story of how main characters "allegedly" beat up a kidnapper to get the location of a missing girl. Perplexingly, Cragen's indignation at Internal Affairs' position that beating up the guy poses a clear violation of even the kidnapper's human rights is presented as being the unquestionably morally righteous position. The episode even ended on a "those two dead people's rights"-style quote.
</li><li> And then there was the case where IA attempted to "disappear" several girls to cover up an anthrax threat. They were only returned after the timely intervention of Olivia and a plucky reporter who exposed their acts to the public.
</li><li> Pretty much one particular IA agent will jump at any accusation to Elliot Stabler no matter how obvious that said accusation is fake (such as a boy claiming he was molested by him to get the charges dropped to a husband having his wife beat him up so they can claim that Elliot was the one that did it) and no matter what he will fully believe the other side until solid evidences is shown they are lying.
</li><li> Later episodes in the series play with this a little bit more, giving IA officer Tucker (who comes to largely represent IA as a whole on SVU) chances to show that he's not inhuman. In one episode, he is said to have actually apologized for jumping the gun, though this doesn't keep him from making the same mistake later on. Subsequent episodes show him being tough but also fair, making sure the detectives are on the level but not trying to railroad them in the same way. He eventually forms a friendship with Olivia despite their past differences, and for a brief time, they become more than friends.
</li><li> The episode "Internal Affairs" is one that takes this to another level. Much to Cragen's shock, Tucker requests help from both Cassidy and SVU in investigating a corrupt precinct where some of the officers were alleged to be raping women while on patrol. Tucker's dedication to the case is sincere, but he also puts Cassidy at risk without adequate warning, which doesn't endear him to the unit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> had a somewhat sympathetic IA detective played by Anthony Anderson in Jesse Martin's last episode. At one point he refers to his two-year assignment to IA being almost up, and the following week, what do you know, he's transferred to Homicide and replaced Martin's character.The Series averted this trope in that while IA were not portrayed as particularly competent, the detectives had no love or loyalty to dirty cops.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> had an episode where Logan and Wheeler had to go to an IA meeting after a fight that involved some firefighters. Wheeler is nervous, while Logan (who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> with one very thick discipline file) tells her not to worry.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em>: IA Detective Gharty is portrayed as very sympathetic, and none of the cops have a problem turning in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerCop">killer cops</a>. Kellerman's persecution in Season Five is mostly bad luck and the cold treatment Gharty received is based more on apparent cowardice on his part.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoPD">Chicago P.D.</a></em> they frequently clash with total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> Voight. Given that he has to report to them, it makes for an interesting situation. While Voight is implied to have been dirty in the past, and may still be slightly dirty, both of the ones he deals with are total dicks, and slightly corrupt themselves.
</li><li> Characters of this nature often appear on the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> series. The most prominent example was in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Trials and Tribble-ations," where a department known as "Temporal Investigations" scrutinizes Captain Sisko over having traveled through time. These guys soften up at the end and are generally just doing their job, but, as even well-intentioned changes to the timeline can be catastrophic, they need to be hard on everyone. They also lament when Captain Kirk is brought up, who's traveled through time way too often for their tastes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006">Life On Mars</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is revealed that Sam Tyler</span> is an undercover cop assigned to Gene Hunt's unit to expose his corruption and rule-breaking so that he could be replaced with a more progressive superior — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except he lost his memory and ended up going native.

</li><li> There was a French TV series whose main characters were a commissioner and an inspector from the French IA; the Inspection Générale des Services men are actually nicknamed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">les Boeuf-Carottes</a>" ("beef and carrots", a dish) because they have a tendency to "grill" the people they question.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>
<ul><li> The first season has Angel torn over reporting to Internal Affairs over an incident regarding Doakes apparently opening fire on a man unprovoked, fearing that the rest of the department will regard him as a rat, as well as being Doakes' friend (and initially trying to get the truth of the matter from him). He does end up providing an incriminating report, but the case is thrown out due to intercession on the basis of national security (Doakes' victim was a former death squad member who he knew from his black ops days). Doakes doesn't end up holding it against him, and threatens a cop who insults Angel.
</li><li> The third season has a wildly inept internal affairs officer who is investigating a very mildly corrupt cop, but goes about it in a terrible way. She approaches his partner and asks for her help, gives no reasoning, and assumes she has the partner's assistance and continues harassing the partner. It also turns out she may have an ulterior motive for pursuing the cop (they used to be partners, with another cop who got killed due to a drug addiction which may have been preventable).
</li></ul></li><li> In the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, this function is performed by the IOA. They're sometimes right, but most of the time the IOA as a whole is treated as a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a>. The most important (plot-wise) of them is Woolsey, who starts as one of SG-1's detractors, while raising quite a few valid objections (like "Shouldn't we consider stopping the project that nearly caused the destruction of our planet on various occasions?"), becomes more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>, and finally gets at the head of Atlantis in the last seasons.
</li><li> There's been plenty of run-ins between the detectives of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> and IA, but the most blatant has to be in season 5, where an ongoing arc has one of the detectives feeling major heat from them over whether or not his shooting a suspect during a hostage situation the previous season was by the book. IA was using it to screw him over for a previous mistake.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>, every time an officer takes a lethal shot, they have to talk to the Special Investigations Unit. While the officers tend to view it as a nuisance, the investigators are said to be generally fair and just there to make sure everything's above board. The one exception occurs in "Acceptable Risk" because the IA officer has a preexisting grudge against Parker, and even she eventually admits she was wrong.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> had the FBI working with an internal affairs officer from LAPD to investigate a cop who's been abusing his position to rape women. She's initially reluctant to believe that an LAPD officer could be responsible and is somewhat insensitive to the victims, at one point sending a uniformed officer to transport a victim and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">completely missing the point</a> when Megan calls her on it. Ultimately, she redeems herself and helps them catch the rapist.
</li><li> Internal Affairs frequently appears on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>, and the entire Arc of Season 5 revolves around a particularly persistent IA officer hounding the Strike Team. The show also subverted it with Lt. Jon Kavanaugh. Beginning as a straight, if extremely unconventional, IAD officer, he metamorphosed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> himself, with a stop at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> along the way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode of the short-lived revival had Joe Friday the subject of an Internal Affairs hearing, with the events told in flashback. In this case though, IAD had a legitimate concern, and Sgt. Friday was honest and non-confrontational. Furthermore, the IAD's investigation is as thorough and professional as Friday's always are and they find the evidence that his actions were completely justified under the circumstances. But then, Joe Friday is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop">the polar opposite</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a>.
</li><li> The above example harkens back to "The Shooting Board", a 1968 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em> episode. Friday walks in on an attempted robbery at a self-service laundromat and exchanges gunfire with the thief, wounding him. Things turn bad, though, when the thief turns up dead, the slug from his gun isn't found, there are no independent witnesses, and his accomplice lies that Friday fired the only shot. Throughout, Friday is tense and worried, but isn't hostile towards the IAB officers or the review board, both of whom are sympathetic but professional. In the end, the IAB detectives find the missing slug, leading to a memorable epilogue: Friday, himself, on camera as the narrator reveals the result ("Sgt. Joe Friday: Returned to Duty").
</li><li> There was also the episode in the 1960s version where Friday and Gannon <em>were</em> the Internal Affairs: they were investigating the shooting of a liquor store clerk where the chief suspect was a rookie undercover narcotics officer (Kent Mccord, pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em> ), who had been picked out of a line-up by an eyewitness. He turns out to be innocent (mistaken identity), and spends most of the episode understandably stressed out and angry at being a suspect at all, but Friday &amp; Gannon never move from their professional yet sympathetic stance.
</li><li> In another episode, Friday is picked as a defender by a cop accused of taking a bribe from a bookie. He said it was because he knew Friday would pull out the stops to defend him if he really was innocent. Friday agreed, but contended he made a lousy lawyer because he'd want the guy convicted if he was guilty. Ultimately, the guy is found guilty of a couple of the charges, but not all of them.
</li><li> In the 1970 episode "I.A.D.: The Receipt", two officers are accused of stealing $800 from the victim of a homicide by the victim's associate. Neither side can produce a receipt for the personal effects the officers took into evidence, including the money. Friday and Gannon, again, are sympathetic but professional. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, Friday finds the officers' missing copy of the receipt (it had been misplaced in their car), plus traces of the associate's copy, proving that she, herself, stole the money and tried to frame the officers.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em> got into it as well, in an episode where Reed and Malloy exchange fire with a sniper at a residence. Reed has to be investigated and his actions checked out to ensure that he was justified in firing his weapon and shooting the suspect. Reed is stressed, but ultimately, his actions were found justified.
<ul><li> Then there was a <em>Dragnet</em> episode that crossed over when Friday and Gannon were investigating a claim that a patrolman struck someone who was drunk and verbally abusive. Reed and Malloy were the other unit that responded, and were interviewed. Everyone involved is given a chance to explain, and in the end the patrolman is suspended for overreacting.
</li></ul></li><li> The Australian mini-series <em>Phoenix</em> had Major Crimes constantly butting heads with the Victorian Police internal affairs unit, nicknamed the 'toecutters' (after a notorious Melbourne gang which tortured people by cutting their toes off). Unsurprising as this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a> series was made at a time when the Victorian police were catching a lot of flack for their methods, especially police shootings (explored particularly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawProcedural">Law Procedural</a> spin-off <em>Janus</em>). Ironically, Jock Brennan, who led the Major Crimes investigation in the first season, returns as an internal affairs investigator later on, showing not the least bit of sympathy for his former colleagues.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Motive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Motive">Motive</a></em>, Sqt. Saunders, an IA detective brought in to do a bullshit hatchet job on Vega is visibly furious at having his department misused in political games and quickly proves to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> who helps out the Homicide Department in several future episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show featured one of the more cynical takes on the role of IID, particularly in the first season. Major Reed, the head of IID, is Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell's pitbull, preventing the Barksdale detail of Cedric Daniels from pursuing leads that Burrell doesn't want them pursuing. It's got nothing to do with making sure Daniels and his team were following the law; it was purely about making sure they are following Burrell's orders.
</li><li> IID gets used cynically again later in the show. Herc (who is white) causes problems for Tommy Carcetti (newly elected white mayor in a largely black city) when Herc use excessive force and humiliates a black preacher he arrested on false information Bubbles gave him. If Carcetti caves to the deacons who want Herc gone over this, he looks weak, and like someone who can be pushed around. If he doesn't, then he's a white man who doesn't care when a white cop pushes a pillar of the black community around. Burrell proves he's just as capable of playing political games by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">having IID come down on Herc for other reasons unconnected to the preacher incident</a>, allowing the black community to be satisfied that Herc got canned without making Carcetti look weak.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgainstTheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgainstTheWall">Against the Wall</a></em> is about a police officer who just joined IA, with the full belief that she can protect innocent police officers. Her family full of cops practically disown her after this.

Even thought Abby didn't find anything wrong with the squad, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a> was still pissed off, and Ham let rats out at Abby.
</li><li> Apparently averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland">Southland</a></em>. When the rookie cop has to shoot a perp in the line of duty, he's told by his veteran partner to get everything out in the open with IA, who will make sure everything goes okay.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdWatch">Third Watch</a></em> storyline had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Fair Cop</a> patrol officer Sasha Monroe revealed as an Internal Affairs detective working undercover to investigate the death (actually a murder) of a suspect responsible for the shooting of another cop. When her deception is discovered, the other cops are so disgusted by her that she is actually left on her own while pursuing a dangerous suspect and nearly killed by him.
</li><li> <em>The Bridge</em> has Internal Affairs being corrupt and going after any cop that the division commander or deputy chief do not like. Their ham-fisted handling of two incidents cause the protagonist Frank Leo to call for a walkout and then for him become a candidate for head of the police union.
<ul><li> IA investigates a veteran cop for accepting a bribe from a pedophile and the cop kills himself. The IA investigator on the case was actually about to subvert the trope and exonerate the cop fully and is so angry at his superiors that he becomes an ally of Frank.
</li><li> IA tries to pin a murder and numerous robberies on Frank with no real evidence. The death was a clear case of self-defense and Frank had nothing to do with the robberies. His union lawyer is so incompetent that he actually let's them get away with making the accusations and thinks that Frank should plead guilty.
</li><li> In the end Frank has to become this trope himself since there really are some very bad cops on the force and as the new head of the union he has to root them out to protect the good ones.

Martens of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue">NYPD Blue</a></em> was a rare three-dimensional example. He was zealous, but not to the point of being a caricature. He once investigated an officer who had fired his gun and decided the shooting was reasonable given the situation. He later confessed that this was the kind of situation he hated — he knew that the cop, while honest, wasn't really suited for police work, and that, by making him "right" on the shooting, Martens was virtually guaranteeing that there would be more trouble somewhere down the road.

Although she and heroine Brenda Leigh Johnson absolutely loathe one another, Raydor is portrayed unusually in that she is not only given redeeming qualities, but is shown to be a skilled and honorable investigator who knows precisely how disliked she and her department are and passionately wishes there was a different way to do things, and Brenda respects her and considers her job a necessary evil.

More unusually, in another episode the head of Internal Affairs is actually <em>leading a ring of vigilante cops</em> (although he had been viewed as a good guy who the heroes respected before his vigilante actions were revealed.)

<ul><li> IA shows up in the form of Lt.

Although none of the detectives are exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cops</a>, naturally Holliwell takes the opportunity to renew his antagonism with Esposito and, in general, the other members of the unit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In something of a subversion, Holliwell turns out to be the corrupt one.</span>
</li><li> Captain Victoria Gates, the replacement to Captain Roy Montgomery, was also previously assigned to Internal Affairs, which creates tension with her new subordinates. She eventually explains to Beckett that she worked in IA not because she hates other cops (her father and uncles were cops), but because some of them really <em>are</em> dirty and people need protection against them just as much as against ordinary criminals.

The officers are seen as decent individuals performing a totally necessary role (in a world where policemen generally are corrupt enough to beat suspects, forge confessions and run their own private businesses on paid time). While the show is sometimes cynical about the outcomes of investigations, it makes it quite clear that corruption exists and shouldn't be condoned.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em>, the routine IA check goes pretty well, much to Captain Trunk's relief, until Sledge shows up. After witnessing the usual Sledge method of processing a suspect, the IA officer demands to see Lieutenant Hammer's service record, which has been carefully hidden from him.

<ul><li> Season 1: In "World on Fire," Detectives Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman murder an associate of Vladimir Ranskahov's in the 15th Precinct for daring to snitch on Fisk (whose name must not be said ever). Fisk and James Wesley put in a call to their contacts in the Internal Affairs Bureau to sweep the whole thing under the rug and bury it. This allows Blake and Hoffman to go back on the street and assist their fellow corrupt cops that night in eliminating any Russians who survive Fisk's bombings of their stashhouses. Unfortunately, Matt happens to overhear the murder, so he goes after Blake, breaks his right arm and gets him to reveal the locations of said stashhouses, allowing him to locate Vladimir. For that transgression, Fisk has Blake shot. That Blake and Hoffman are so quickly back on the streets is lampshaded by Ben Urich when he turns up as they're establishing a perimeter around an abandoned warehouse where a rookie cop has stumbled upon Matt and Vladimir and subsequently been knocked out.

</div><ul><li> In season 3, Fisk manipulates the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility as part of a bigger gambit to turn Dex into his top assassin. Fisk gets OPR to open an investigation into Dex's killing of the Albanian hit squad, knowing they will find evidence that Dex broke protocol. He lies to the investigators when they come to interview him, something he ensures Dex will watch it on tape later and notice that Fisk is protecting him. Later in the season, when Nadeem and Matt find evidence of Dex's treachery, Nadeem takes his suspicions to OPR Agent Winn and they sit down for an interview with Nadeem's boss Tammy Hattley at her house. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The meeting is a setup, as Hattley is also on Fisk's payroll.

While he's mostly able to squeak by without arousing suspicions, things begin falling apart for him after he kills Chico, a petty criminal who was part of a botched robbery to steal money from Cottonmouth. Internal Affairs begins cracking down on him, and after removing a van full of Cottonmouth's guns from an evidence locker, he decides to blackmail Cottonmouth for $100,000 as hazard pay. This culminates in him being fatally shot by Cottonmouth, and after his death, a lot of the cases he worked with Misty are found to have been tainted and any convictions resulting from them get overturned on appeal.

Watson and Holmes both approve of her...until the former finds out she is Internal Affairs, and the latter finds out she is dating Bell. Watson is naturally worried that Bell doesn't know, and that he may unintentionally get other cops in trouble. Holmes is actually quite supportive of the role of IAB, citing them the only way to check police corruption and that their previous cases with corrupt cops had required their help. Despite this, Bell is upset when he finds out about her IA connections.
<ul><li> The series generally comes down on the side of IAB, and doesn't demonize cops who inform on other cops if those accusations are justified. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Captain Gregson</a> is disgusted when he learns that a former partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">planted evidence</a> when a suspect couldn't be positively connected to a crime they were sure he'd committed.
