</li><li> The country has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerminallyExclusiveClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerminallyExclusiveClub">VERY strict succession rules</a>, and there are barely any successors to begin with.
</li></ol><p>In a monarchy, this often means that some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">distant or estranged relative</a> of the previous monarch is ascending the throne, frequently leading to a great deal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> humor, as the Unexpected Successor has not received the extensive preparation for power usually given to an heir apparent. Also note that, due to the generally predictable nature of royal succession, it's possible for someone to start their life rather far down the line of succession and still be expected to become monarch someday. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> was born fifth in line to the English throne, but everyone ahead of her was at least a generation older than she was and unlikely to have more children. So she grew up expecting to be queen and being groomed for the role, and thus would not be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> example of this trope.

</p><p>This can happen in democracies as well, if the elected leader suddenly resigns or is incapacitated and someone has to take their place until new elections can be held. While most countries have established lines of succession to make this as orderly as possible, the person who rises to the top of the list can be surprising... such as an Agriculture Secretary who must go from teaching farmers how to grow peanuts to running a country as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. In the United States, rules for succession beyond Vice President -&gt; President are set by Congress, not the Constitution. The Speaker of the House and President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate are next, then Cabinet secretaries in order by age of office. In fiction, the Speaker of the House of Representatives is almost always a member of a different political party than their predecessor. Usually the Speaker resigns their seat in Congress (as required by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947), but for added turmoil, they won't.

</li><li> A more bureaucratic version of this is averted when Guilford steps into command after the Black Knights kill Viceroy Calares in the first arc of R2, and everyone else in that line of succession down to a civil servant who would not have been able to govern in a situation like that.

In the process, Ryuuki moved from the bottom of his family's pecking order to his father's anointed successor. The only other surviving heir, Prince Seien, was already in exile when the civil war began because his mother's kin had made a power play too early. Ryuuki — who isn't interested in being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>, believes himself to be incapable of ruling well, and wants nothing more than to see his favorite elder brother again — stubbornly resists ruling and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">plays dumb</a> in hopes that his courtiers will give up and offer the throne to Seien.

<ul><li> Tokugawa Yoshimune was not only from a minor branch of the Tokugawa dynasty, but was the third daughter of said branch, so it was considered unlikely that she'd even become the head of her family, much less shogun. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her older sisters were poisoned to remove them from the succession, and the sickly nature of the direct line meant that the last two members both had short reigns, so she took advantage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> and proclaimed herself shogun.</span> <br/><br/>Which was in fact lampshaded by Ten'ei-in, the consort of a previous shogun:
<div class="indent">"Now here we sit in the sun, enjoying tea together, with one whom nobody e'er thought would become the supreme leader of this land, at the time of her birth."
</div></li><li> The only time they met, the elderly Shogun Tsunayoshi noted to Yoshimune that she was herself an Unexpected Successor, being the third daughter of Iemitsu the Younger, and had only inherited the throne after her oldest half-sister Ietsuna died without issue. By primogeniture, her middle half-sister Tsunashige should have been the successor, but her mother Iemitsu preferred Tsunayoshi's father over Tsunashige's and seems to have favored his daughter in the order of succession.
</li><li> And now, the ultimate example: Harusada abdicates her claim to the throne in favor of her <em>son</em> Toyochiyo, making the now Shogun Ienari the first male shogun in generations.
</li><li> With the male population slowly getting back to normal levels (due to an effective Redface Pox vaccine) and Ienari himself being succeeded by his son Ieyoshi, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it was a big surprise when Ienari declared Ieyoshi's <em>daughter</em> Iesada next in line.

In the main novels, we learn he became Aegon Targaryen, the Fifth of His Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, styled Aegon the Unlikely for assuming a throne no one expected he'd get as he was the youngest son of a king's youngest brother. He proved an excellent ruler though, and given the nature of most of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">older</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">brothers</a>, the Seven Kingdoms came out lucky that time. It's generally accepted that he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">last decent one.</a>
</li><li> Aemon Targaryen, one of his older brothers, survives to the main stories as an old, old man who took the Maester's Chains and went to the Wall as a young man. He dies at 102 asking in his delirium for Egg. He tells a story to young Jon Snow that many years ago, before Egg was crowned King, the nobles and the maesters asked him to renounce his vows and take the throne. Egg was only crowned because Aemon took his vows seriously. He even joined the Night's Watch so he couldn't be used to dethrone his brother.
</li><li> King Robert Baratheon hails from a cadet branch of the Targaryen line, so his succession was just as unlikely. By all accounts, he graciously accepted the position of King after he smashed the Targaryen dynasty, but before he could even be crowned, there were a few tense moments when just about anyone — Ned Stark, Tywin Lannister, or even Jaime Lannister — could have proclaimed themselves king, but didn't. Then there's also the unfortunate fact the legitimate successor he killed — Rhaegar Targaryen — would have been a perfectly decent king compared to his father Aerys, and even more so, Prince Rhaegar's children would have made good heirs, had Tywin Lannister not ordered them killed.
</li><li> In the North, Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North at the start of the books, has five legitimate children, an illegitimate son and a younger brother. Both Eddard's younger brother and illegitimate son have taken the vows as members of the Night's Watch and are therefore removed from succession (Jon Snow, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">illegitimate son</a>, couldn't have inherited anyway). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Lord Eddard is executed, his oldest son Robb becomes King in the North (the old title his family held before the Targaryen conquest). Robb's younger brother Bran is his heir until he has children of his own. However, when Bran and Rickon are later presumed dead, succession passes to his first sister, Sansa, who's married (not at all willingly) to one of the Lannisters, the Starks' arch-rivals. His second sister Arya is considered dead by this point and his uncle went missing. To avoid the chance of Lannisters ruling the North and to ensure that a family member of Stark blood familiar with the North will be his successor in case he dies, Robb legitimizes his illegitimate brother Jon Snow and names Jon heir, who (while he was raised alongside Robb by their father as a son of a lord) never expected to inherit family lands himself due to his illegitimacy and never learns of Robb making him his heir. Robb later dies. Afterward, Jon <em>repeatedly turns down</em> Stannis' offers to legitimize him out of loyalty to his father's gods, duty to the Night's Watch, and because of Sansa's claim on Winterfell. All the while — since the whereabouts of Robb's will are unknown — Jon might be the claimant to King in the North and doesn't know it... Talk about unlikely. And <em>now</em>, one of the Northern lords, Lord Manderly, has discovered that Ned's youngest son Rickon is still alive and Manderly is plotting to make him Lord of Winterfell/King.</span>

</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen has taken to calling herself "The Queen Across the Water", and has assumed the mantle of the Targaryen heir apparent in exile after her older brothers and nephew are each killed before they could assume the throne from their father/grandfather, King Aerys Targaryen II.

<ul><li> While Firestar's ascension to the leader of Thunderclan itself was not unexpected, him becoming the next in line before said succession happened very much was. There is only one official warrior rank in the line of succession below leader, the deputy, and it almost universally goes to a senior warrior who has lived in the clan for many years and seen countless battles. Firestar was the youngest warrior at the time, was not born in the clan, and was quite the rulebreaker to boot, making him possibly the least likely candidate other than the apprentices and kits. He was only chosen because he saved Bluestar's life from her previous deputy, making him the only one she fully trusted due to her being shaken by her trusted deputy's betrayal.
</li><li> Tigerstar's ascension to the leader of Shadowclan was especially unexpected, given that he wasn't even a member of the clan at the time. After being exiled from Thunderclan, he came across Shadowclan, which was being ravaged by a horrible illness. Both its leader and deputy had been killed by said sickness, and the rest of the clan were either gravely ill or too demoralized to step up to the position. Thus, when Tigerstar, a healthy, powerful, and well-respected cat showed up, they desperately begged him to take up the position of their leader.

</li><li> This can happen to the player in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShogunTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShogunTotalWar">Shogun: Total War</a></em>, because of the way that births of heirs, aging, and succession are modelled, if you fail to manage your family properly, odd stuff can happen. Only the player's current character can die of old age or sire children, and the chance is random on any turn with penalties for age. For instance, the 90-year-old uncle of the current Daimyo, immune to age since he's not the head of the family, could be the only one left if the Daimyo's sons all die in battle or assassinations. He succeeds the throne when his 60-some year old nephew dies, and then himself dies the next turn on a random old-age roll buoyed up by 30 years of penalties, ending the game.
</li><li> In later games in the <em>Total War</em> series, the game doesn't end, your country "merely" goes into civil war as any general with a drop of royal blood tries to claim the throne. The player is allowed to pick one of the claimants to make the <em>de facto</em> legitimate heir, and everyone else gets treated as a Rebel faction by the game. Players at risk of this have been known to marry a princess to their best general, which gives him a claim to the throne too. After all, if you're gonna have to fight your own guys, might as well do it with your best commander and biggest army. In in-game terms, this can result in a minor lord, knight, or even <em>commoner</em> being vaulted onto the throne. Which, considering how one of the three Great Unifiers of Japan was a peasant-born samurai, makes it a rather delicious bit of irony for a player.

In this case, "unexpected" only describes an outside perspective, though: because The Score (the prophecy that controls the world's fate) is a completely accurate prediction of the future, Peony's father had been told that he would eventually ascend to the throne. That was why Peony was sent away from the court intrigues to live incognito, where he ran off from his guards to play with commoner children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em> is in love with this trope. The previous monarch, King Dorgalua, was a commoner who managed to become the first king of Valeria by defeating his biggest rival, King Roderick, in the middle of a bloody ethnic civil war. Dorgalia has a legitimate son with a Bacrum noblewoman, but he dies at a young age and so does the Queen. This leaves Valeria in yet another civil war, which each one of the ethnic groups being led by a different pretender, all trying to become King. Ultimately it turns out that Catiua, the protagonist Denim's adopted sister, is the unknown bastard daughter of King Dorgalia, and thus the rightful Queen.

Secondly, some of the succession laws can be kind of hard to predict, specifically Elective, since in the first game it's largely based on the number of provinces and so can swap at any time, while in the second game it depends on how the vassals feel at the precise moment the previous ruler dies. Lastly and most importantly, sometimes the minor distant relation with no real expectation of getting the throne is in the player's dynasty, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">the player will stop at nothing to make this trope happen</a>.
</li><li> The Reaper invasion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> leads to several of these happening:
<ul><li> General Adrien Victus finds himself promoted to Primarch of the turian race (essentially Commander-in-Chief of the entire military-structured Turian Hierarchy) in the opening days of the Reaper War. This comes as an extreme surprise to him: while he's a very competent military commander, the fact that he has a habit of ignoring standard military doctrine in favor of unorthodox tactics means that he's always been passed up for further promotion. The fact that <em>he</em> of all people has been promoted so high up is a sign of just how badly the war is going for the turians.
</li><li> Later, it's possible for Shepard to tease Garrus about the possibility of becoming Primarch Vakarian, given his evident yet nebulous high position in the turian military (he has no official rank, but an impressive amount of resources were laid at his disposal a few months before the Reapers finally attacked). Garrus is unwilling to even discuss the possibility.
</li><li> The Codex mentions in passing that Admiral Hackett, recently the commander of the Systems Alliance Fifth Fleet, is now the <em>de facto</em> leader of humanity as a whole, due to his rallying of surviving human forces after the initial Reaper assault, and his leveraging the surviving colonies to get support for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Crucible</span>, while trying to delay the Reaper advance.

Through a series of complications, Spiro Agnew ends up as Acting President. He promptly restarts the Vietnam War, tanks the economy, and makes a lot of senior officials fear he'll kick off World War Three. Then his criminal history comes out and impeachment efforts start. Because he's technically still the Vice President, the Oval Office would fall into the hands of the Speaker of the House... who's a Democrat. Agnew assumes his own party won't hand the Executive over to the other side, regardless of what they think of his job performance, an assumption the Speaker shares. So the Congressional leadership exploits the loophole discussed at the top of this page: the Speaker of the House can be <em>anyone</em>. The House membership appoints the Speaker, but it's only long-standing tradition that the Speaker is a member of the majority party. Legally, any American citizen can be made Speaker so long as the House membership elects them to the office. Thus, the non-partisian retired <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lieutenant General James "Jumpin' Jim" Gavin</span> is appointed as Speaker, and Agnew is promptly kicked out of the White House.

Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">George was attainted for treason</a>, removing his children from the line, and it was revealed that the rather promiscuous Edward had made a precontract of marriage with another woman before marrying his queen, thus making all <em>his</em> children illegitimate and suddenly catapulting Richard to kingship.
<ul><li> Interestingly, some have postulated that the two events are not unrelated, since George had previously been pardoned for his rebellion in 1469-1471, meaning that he must have done something <em>else</em> to cause an execution (and one could be charged for high treason at that time for attempting to muck about with the succession) and furthermore, Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was at that time imprisoned in the Tower for "uttering seditious words," under which charge the crime of revealing the existence of the precontract to George would have neatly fallen. All this is not to mention the fact that the queen, who came from a minor noble family whose members had been suddenly catapulted to prominence, certainly had reason to fear a loss of her and her family's royal power and prestige.
</li></ul></li><li> At the time of his birth, Richard III's successor Henry Tudor was second in line for the throne as the half-nephew of King Henry VI, although his claim was through his mother and came via a lineage that had been both legitimised by law and barred from future ascension by Richard II<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29osa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29osa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29osa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Richard II legitimising originally illegitimate offspring wasn't as much of a problem for Henry Tudor to overcome as the dubious legality of Richard II's decision to bar future issue from claims to the throne was for Henry Tudor's opponents to try and uphold</span>. He became a much more unlikely successor when Edward Duke of York killed the King and the crown prince, and installed his two sons and two brothers in the order of succession. No one thought Henry Tudor could beat those odds, but he emerged from the civil war as Henry VII and made sure of the throne by marrying the most plausible other successor, Elizabeth of York who as the eldest daughter and child of Edward IV with no surviving brothers had a strong claim which she passed to her children.
</li><li> When Henry VIII died in 1547, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, was 4th in line for the English throne, after Henry's three healthy legitimate children. It was considered very unlikely the Stuarts would ever rule England, especially considering that Margaret Tudor (who her claim came through) had relinquished her claim to the throne, making Mary's claims rather tenuous, Scotland and England were enemies for much of Henry's reign, and she was a Catholic (despite the increasing Protestantism of her people, particularly in the Lowlands) while England became increasingly Protestant. However, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I all assumed the throne and then died childless. As Mary herself was also dead (executed after being caught in England after attempting to assassinate Elizabeth, no less) 56 years after Henry's death, Mary's son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfStuart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfStuart">James VI</a> of Scotland became James I of England, seen by Elizabeth and the English people as the best option as all others were either convicted for treason, too young, or Catholic (and James had been raised Protestant at the insistence of the powerful Lowland lords).
</li><li> The successors to the Stuarts, the minor German princes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">The House of Hanover</a>, were more or less handed the British throne out of nowhere. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, all Catholics were excluded from the succession, and Queen Anne's heir was the junior Stuart line of Electress Sophia of Hanover. This is why George I and George II (Sophia's son and grandson) spoke little to no English: they were 41 and 18, respectively, when the Act of Settlement made them second and third in line, and 54 and 31 when the throne passed to their house. This accelerated the trend of direct governance by ministers instead of the monarch, and by the end of George I's reign, the general system used in Britain today had been developed under the guidance of the (unofficial) prime minister Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertWalpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertWalpole">Robert Walpole</a>. So, indirectly, we have this trope to thank for the modern system of parliamentary democracy — used in some form by the vast majority of democratic states in existence today.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> was a subversion: she was fully expected to inherit the throne from the day she was born, but her <em>existence</em> only came about because Britain unexpectedly found itself without an heir. The previous heir, George IV's daughter Princess Charlotte, had died shortly after delivering a stillborn son<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3v689');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3v689" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3v689');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Her symptoms—apparently healthy, then delirious and vomiting, then dead—suggest eclampsia, though we'll never know for sure</span> even before her father became King, leading to a mad dash among George's brothers to produce an heir. (George himself was unlikely to produce a new heir, as he hated his wife so much that nothing could entice him to attempt to father a child with her—he kept trying to divorce her, in fact, though Parliament wouldn't let him—and in any case, by the time Princess Charlotte passed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight">he probably couldn't father a child if he tried</a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">King George VI</a> — then Prince Albert, Duke of York — was not expecting to become King, instead planning a military career and a quiet life with his duchess and their two daughters. Then his older brother pitched a royal fit and abdicated. Cue a constitutional crisis, a world war, and a <em>very</em> uncomfortable King taking the throne of an empire he never expected to reign over. Which he did magnificently — George VI is one of the best beloved monarchs of British history—but at a terrible cost to his personal health. (Incidentally, his father, George V, had a similar trajectory, but since <em>his</em> older brother, Prince Albert Victor, died well before either of them would even get close to the throne, he had more time to adjust.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the early years, the United States Presidency took this trope to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme">Logical Extreme</a>: how succession <em>itself</em> worked wasn't made clear, and the precedent set was quite unexpected. Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the United States Constitution <em>did</em> allow for a scenario in which the President died <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05kl6');"><sup> The actual text </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note05kl6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05kl6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.</span>, but didn't explain if just the powers and duties of the Presidency or the office <em>itself</em> devolved on the Vice President should the sitting President expire before his term did. <br/><br/>Then in 1841, President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison">William Henry Harrison</a> did exactly that. <br/><br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a>'s interpretation was that the office of President <em>itself</em> devolved onto the Vice President, not just its powers and duties.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ndfx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ndfx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ndfx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Eventually, this practice was worked into the constitution by the 20th Amendment in 1933, which is probably better known for changing the start dates of presidential and Congressional terms (previously March 4th, now January 20th and 3rd respectively). Incidentally, the president when this amendment was ratified, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, would himself die in office and be replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman">Harry S Truman</a>, who fits this trope due to FDR having told him absolutely zilch about what was going on.</span> While it has rarely been invoked beyond Vice Presidents taking over for their late running mates, the US government has a defined <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession">line of Presidential succession<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that lays out who would become President in the event that multiple members of the administration were rendered unable to serve. Because this line of succession also puts a hard limit on how far down the governmental food chain the Presidency can fall, the Secret Service makes certain that one person in the line is <em>not</em> in attendance at any "all hands" event like the State of the Union Address, but instead in a safe house far enough away that no single plausible catastrophe could wipe out the entire succession.
<ul><li> Pundits brought this up in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan, where Secretary of State Al Haig told the press, "Pending the arrival of the Vice-President, I'm in charge here at the White House." While he only meant that he was in charge of the administrative staff until VP George H.W. Bush could return from his vacation in Maine, the pundits all ignored the context and treated it as if Haig was trying to stage a coup. Until Bush could be contacted, the acting President was actually Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zcu7');"><sup> </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1zcu7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zcu7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (a left-wing Democrat from Massachusetts whom Reagan was known to absolutely despise)</span>, though his only real responsibility was command over the US nuclear arsenal.
</li><li> The "Designated Survivor" rule has been unofficially extended by Congress to include at least one Senator and one Representative, so that in the event of a decapitation strike there would also be successors to the roles of Senate President Pro Tempore and Speaker of the House.
</li><li> The aforementioned line of succession is not immediately obvious based on contemporary priorities—in case of a decapitation terrorist strike, the Secretary of Homeland Security is <em>last</em> in line. Currently, if something happens to Trump, the office passes first to Vice-President Pence, then Speaker Pelosi.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50wbz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note50wbz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50wbz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> And just to add the potential for further mischief, the Speaker of the House does not necessarily need to be a member of Congress at all! The majority vote of the House membership could theoretically install <em>any</em> American citizen as Speaker. The leader of the majority party being Speaker of the House is actually just tradition, not law.</span> If something happens to all three, next is line is Senate President <em>pro tempore</em> Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who holds his position solely by virtue of being the longest continuously-serving member of the majority party.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6yc1h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6yc1h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6yc1h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The spot had previously been held by the same-aged Orrin Hatch of Utah and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii who both held it until 85 years old (Hatch retired, Inouye died), and before then by the still-older Robert Byrd of West Virginia until he died at 92. Grassley passed Hatch and Inouye in age on September 17, 2019.</span> The fourth in line is the Secretary of State, and then the other Cabinet Secretaries in order by age of office. Homeland Security is the newest department, and thus the last in line.
</li><li> Also, this only applies during a President's term, and not during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">an election</a>. If the President-elect dies after the electoral college votes, then the Vice President-elect would become President on Inauguration Day. If, however, the presumed winner dies before the electoral college actually votes, no one's quite sure what would happen as the electors could ignore the popular vote results or refuse to vote for a dead man, and throw the election to someone who wasn't even on the ballot or force the state caucuses in the House to vote instead.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29nrd');"><sup>Fun Fact! </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29nrd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29nrd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> While there has thus far never been a case of a Presidential <em>winner</em> dying after the election but before the counting of electoral votes (about a two-month window), there <em>has</em> been at least one instance of the <em>loser</em> dying during that time - Horace Greeley, defeated by incumbent Ulysses Grant in the 1872 election. In that case, the candidate's electors were released  some voted for the failed Vice President, but most simply were scattered amongst various candidates. Unsurprisingly, this case happened during the 19th century.</span>
</li><li> It was disputed whether the Vice President would be "Acting President" or "President" until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison">William Henry Harrison</a> died and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a> refused to even acknowledge anyone who called his position "Acting". Anyone below the VP, however, would be "Acting President" until the next presidential election, under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 <a class="urllink" href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/3/1/19">3 USC § 19.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> This plus appointment being used for mid-term VP replacements<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ngtj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ngtj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ngtj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (the practice only became a thing after World War II; prior to that, whenever a VP died in office  it happened more than once  the President simply governed without a VP until the next election; same thing applied whenever a VP was elevated upon his boss's death)</span> led to Michigan Representative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeraldFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeraldFord">Gerald Ford</a> becoming the only <em>truly</em> unelected President of the United States. All arguments about contested elections aside (and there are plenty), Ford was appointed to the Vice Presidency after Spiro Agnew resigned over accusations of bribery and tax fraud, became president after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> resigned over the Watergate scandal, then lost to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a> in his first national election. This was just <em>after</em> Speaker of the House Carl Albert had passed up the opportunity to <em>make</em> himself Nixon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">Unexpected Successor</a>. As Speaker, Albert had the power to prevent Ford's nomination from coming to a vote, thus guaranteeing a VP vacancy after Nixon's by-then-inevitable impeachment or resignation. Albert declined to do so on the grounds that the American people had chosen to have a Republican as President and it would be something verging on a coup if he, a Democrat, arranged his own succession.
</li></ul></li><li> It should be pointed out that the rules of succession can skip lists based on the individual. The President of the United States must be a citizen by birth (or were citizens of one of the 13 colonies at the time of the country's formation, for you immortals out there) but that does not apply beyond the Vice-President in the succession line. It's entirely possible that a cabinet member or the Speaker could be a naturalized citizen, disqualifying them from becoming President, and thus their next in line is moved up in the line. These cases will never be the designated survivor, so it's very unlikely to be an issue beyond pundit speculation about who the designated survivor is prior to the State of the Union starting.
</li><li> Possibly the greatest subversion of the trope was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiro_II_of_Aragon">Ramiro II of Aragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The fourth son of King Sancho, he wasn't expected to inherit or hold a political position at all and became a priest. However, all three of his elder brothers died without issue, two of them after having seized the crown. He was then literally taken from his abbey, given a Papal permission to abandon his vows so he could guarantee the survival of the dynasty, and crowned. He complied, married, had a daughter, abdicated to her, and had her married when she was <em>1 year old</em>. With his duty accomplished in record time, he took the vows again and went back to his abbey.
<ul><li> Henry of Portugal started off in similar straits but wasn't able to follow through as magnificently—no one expected him to succeed to the throne when his eldest surviving brother became King John III, but during John's reign, their three other brothers died without legitimate issue and both of the king's sons predeceased him. He was succeeded by his infant grandson Sebastian, who died unmarried at the age of 25, leaving his great uncle Henry, by then a 66-year old Catholic cardinal, heir to the throne. Henry applied for papal dispensation to abandon his vow of chastity and father an heir. However, Philip II, the King of Spain, who was Henry's nephew through his older sister, stood a chance of inheriting Portugal were Henry to die without issue, and the Pope at the time, Gregory XIII (the one with the calendar) was (1) a good personal friend of Philip's from his time as Papal Legate to Spain and (2) needed Philip for several projects, including expansion of the Church in Asia and bringing England back into the Catholic fold (that's what the Spanish Armada was about). So the Pope refused to give dispensation, and when Henry died, still unmarried, two years later, there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> from which Philip II emerged triumphant.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in the later two-thirds of the Qing dynasty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">Imperial China</a>. The Yongzheng Emperor had his legitimacy consistently questioned due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> in 1710-1720s (in which his father deposed the crown prince, then died without naming a replacement), and decided that while the monarch had the power to nominate any successor, no one should feel overly confident of their place in the order of succession. His new succession scheme was thus: every moment the emperor was alive, he was required to have secured somewhere in the palace a sealed will and testament which would only be opened in event of his death. As a result, no heir would be <em>publicly</em> named, and while the emperor's personal preference might be apparent, it would never create a binding order of succession.
</li><li> The French monarchy's application of Salic Law, which not only absolutely forbade female succession but also excluded any claim through female lines, has resulted in several Unexpected Successors when the direct male line has to backtrack quite far into cadet branches:
<ul><li> The primacy of Salic Law was established with the succession of King Philip VI. When Philip IV ("the Fair") died, he left three surviving sons (Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV) and a daughter (Isabella), so his brother's son Philip of Valois was not expected to ever ascend the throne. However, Louis X and Charles IV's wives had recently been condemned for adultery, casting doubt on the legitimacy of their surviving children, all daughters. Then Louis X and Philip V both died in their early 20s, Louis X's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">posthumous son</a> by his second wife died a few days after birth, and Charles IV died at age 34 in 1328. This left three candidates for the succession: Philip of Valois, Charles of Navarre (son of Jeanne, one of Louis X's daughters) and Edward III of England (son of Isabella). Ironically, the French nobility decided to settle the crisis based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">direct male-line descent</a> NOT primarily because of legal precedent from ancient Frankish custom (which was only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">RetConned</a> into the story two generations later) but because there were strong political arguments against the two candidates with claims through female descent (the suspect legitimacy of Charles' mother and Edward's connections to hostile England—to say nothing of preventing the English monarchs, who were already Dukes of Aquitaine and held other French lands as well, from strengthening their position in France and threatening the power of the other nobles).
</li><li> King Charles VII was unexpected for reasons unrelated to Salic Law. When he was born in 1403, two of his four elder brothers were still alive. Then they both died, leaving Charles the new Dauphin, but the invading English King Henry V forced Charles VI to name Henry successor to the French throne and exclude the Dauphin on the grounds of alleged illegitimate birth. Then against all expectations the apparently invincible Henry died before Charles VI, with the surviving English claimant being the infant Henry VI, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a> showed up to help Charles rout the formidable Anglo-Burgundian forces and make good his claim to the throne.
</li><li> King Henry IV. When Henry II of France was killed in a jousting accident in 1559, his dynasty seemed secure as he was survived by no less than four sons. But Francois II died childless in 1560, Charles IX's died in 1574 with his only legitimate child a daughter, and childless Henry III was assassinated in 1589, by which time the youngest brother, Francois Duke of Anjou, had also died unmarried and childless. This left Henry of Navarre as Salic heir, as he could claim direct male-line descent from a younger son of the <em>13th century</em> King Louis IX.
</li><li> While it was mostly a case of simply going down from father to son, the accession of Louis XV in 1715 was a case of an unexpected, or at any rate unexpectedly young successor. His predecessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> had the longest reign of any French king and survived his only legitimate son to survive to adulthood, the Dauphin Louis (died of smallpox in 1711), the latter's eldest son, Louis, Duke of Burgundy (died of measles in February 1712), and the Duke of Burgundy's oldest surviving son Louis, Duke of Brittany<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8ec6h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8ec6h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8ec6h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> His elder brother Louis, also titled Duke of Brittany, had died in 1705 before turning one year old.</span> (died of measles in March 1712 aged 5). Which led to Louis XIV being succeeded by his <em>great-grandson</em> Louis, Duke of Anjou (younger brother of the Duke of Brittany), aged five years and a half.
</li><li> The <em>fear</em> of an unexpected successor was a major concern for Louis XIV's House of Bourbon at several points:
<ul><li> After the death of Louis XIII, Louis XIV and his younger brother Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, were the only agnatic Bourbons. Had they both died, the Salic heir to the throne was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">impoverished</a> House of Courtenay, who had branched off the main Capetian line in the 12th century. For various reasons, nobody liked the Courtenays, least of all the Bourbons, and this appears to have informed the terms of the 1662 Treaty of Montmartre in which Louis XIV named the House of Lorraine<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note99r99');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note99r99" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note99r99');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, the ones who married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> and thus became inextricably linked to the House of Habsburg—history is full of ironies</span> as heirs to the French throne, even though they descended from the French monarchy only in the female line. It also appears to have influenced great fervor with which the Bourbons went about having offspring. In particular, it seems to have informed Philippe's decision to not only marry a woman, but marry again after his wife had died, and have seven children by his wives, even though he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">flamingly gay</a> and might have otherwise been sent to join the Church or otherwise not required to produce children.
</li><li> Philippe's substantial brood led to concern for Louis' line, as (after the Peace of Utrecht) they were the next in line to the throne from the death of the Sun King clear through the 19th century. This was a problem, since the House of Orléans were notorious freethinkers and liberals who delighted in annoying the senior Bourbons. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> hit, Philippe II, the Duke of Orléans at the time, sided with the Third Estate, leading to much talk on the Right that he had orchestrated the revolution to seize the throne for himself.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Alexander III of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a> is a particularly tragic example. His father, Alexander II, never thought that his son, Nicholas Alexandrovich, would have health problems until Nicholas died suddenly. The second son, Alexander, never was considered for the throne, so he never got the education of his brother and thus reversed many of his father's liberalizing reforms, pushing Russia down a more autocratic path.
<ul><li> Speaking of Alexander II, his own father Nicholas I was the third son of Paul I, but succeeded to the throne after his oldest brother Alexander I died without an heir and his second oldest brother Constantine renounced his right to the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> Very similarly to the above, the noted reformer Muhammad Ali Pasha of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egypt</a> made sure both of his sons got his reforming outlook. One died before his father, and the other a matter of months later, leaving the country in the hands of the incompetent grandson, Abbas, who proceeded to undo Egypt's modern tax system and set the country towards its eventual domination by the British.
</li><li> The papal succession is elective, not dynastic, but there have been some unexpected successors to St. Peter, especially when the conclave deadlocked over the most obvious candidates and compromised by plucking someone from obscurity. The most notable such case probably occurred after the death of pope Nicolaus IV in 1292, when the conclave was deadlocked for two years. The 85-year-old Benedictine monk and hermit Pietro di Morrone sent them a letter telling them to get along with electing a new pope, and shortly after found himself elected to the post. He at first tried to refuse his new office. Eventually he gave in, took the name Celestine V, but the strain proved too much and so a few months later he became the first pope (and the only one before Benedict XVI) to voluntarily resign from office.
</li><li> Goodluck Jonathan, President of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nigeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nigeria">Nigeria</a> 2010-2015, was elected to the largely meaningless post of Vice President under a fellow named Umaru Yar'Adua. When Yar'Adua died early in his term, Jonathan took over, and to everyone's surprise ran for election in his own right in 2011  the Nigerian political parties had an informal agreement that Muslims and Christians were to take turns as president, but Jonathan, a Christian, had been filling the term of a Muslim (Yar'Adua). The fact that Jonathan not only won, but won without serious objection from the predominantly Muslim north, was taken at the time as evidence that Nigeria's long sectarian struggle had, if not ended, then certainly died down.
</li><li> While there wasn't much left to take charge of by the time he came to power in May 1945, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Großadmiral</a></em> Karl Dönitz would in 1939 have been a million-to-one-against bet for "leader of Germany when the current hostilities end".
</li><li> Read the summation above of how Jim Hacker actually got to be Prime Minister in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesPrimeMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesPrimeMinister">Yes, Prime Minister</a></em>, in both the TV show and the novel. Then fast-forward to real-life events in Great Britain in 1990, when the Conservative Party needed a new leader following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s loss of support and decision to withdraw her candidacy. Several strong candidates emerged, each with the potential to split the party into factions. Then a compromise candidate, the grey and relatively un-known John Major, emerged, a man hardly anybody either liked or hated. The result was a completely surprising new PM, one tasked with stabilising the nation after the Thatcher years...
</li><li> King William III of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">the Netherlands</a> (1849-90) was also Grand Duke of the small independent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Luxembourg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Luxembourg">Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</a>. Both the Netherlands and Luxembourg had semi-salic succession (meaning that women could inherit the throne only if there was absolutely no male-line heirs left), however, in the Netherlands only descendents of William's grandfather, the first king of the House of Nassau, counted as heirs. Therefore, when all William III's sons died before him, he was succeeded in the Netherlands by his daughter Princess Wilhelmina, and in Luxembourg by his closest male-line relative, Duke Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg — his <em>17th cousin</em> once removed<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107aek');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note107aek" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107aek');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though they were more closely related though a female line, being third cousins. He also happened to be William III's second wife's maternal half-uncle</span>. Their last common male-line ancestor was Henry the Rich, Count of Nassau, who had lived over six hundred years earlier (he died in 1250). Duke Adolph is generally considered the most distant "distant relative" to ever inherit a European throne.
</li><li> It was not in the cards that Prince Christian of Glücksburg would inherit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark">Danish</a> throne as King Christian IX (1863-1906) when he was born in 1818 as the fourth son in an obscure German sideline of the Danish Royal family. However, when it became clear in the 1850'ies that the main line of the Royal House would end with the death of King Frederik VII (1848-63), not only was Christian the only candidate to have spent extensive time in Denmark, he had also married King Frederik's closest female relative, which, due to some ancient and very complicated succession rules, gave him an edge over both his elder brothers, and the competing sideline, the Dukes of Augustenborg.
<ul><li> The current monarch of Denmark, Christian IX's great-great granddaughter Margrethe II (1972-), was not expected to succeed her father King Frederik IX (1947-72) at the time of her birth in 1940. However, when Frederik did not have any sons, the constitution was changed in 1953 to allow male-preference primogeniture. This, by the way, was not so much a question of equal rights as politics: The political establishment in Denmark had wanted a new constitution for a long time, however this required a very large level of public approval.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11vtzr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11vtzr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11vtzr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">45% of the <em>entire electorate</em> had to vote yes in the referendum.</span> By promising the people the popular Princess Margrethe as future Queen it was just possible to get the votes required for the new constitution.

The eleventh emperor, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxerxes_III">Artaxerxes III<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, came to power after one of his brothers was executed, another committed suicide and another was murdered. Artaxerxes III was then poisoned by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EunuchsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EunuchsAreEvil">eunuch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">vizier</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagoas">Bagoas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (or died by natural causes) and replaced by his son <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arses_of_Persia">Arses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was the youngest son of Arthaxerxes III and his wife Atossa. Arses was then killed two years later (along with his family) by Bagoas. Arses was then succeeded by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III">Darius III<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who turned out to be the last Achaemenid emperor, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>.
</li><li> Pretty much the entire Julio-Claudian dynasty after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a> were very low on their predecessor's list of preferred heirs, but wound up emperor after everyone ahead of them fell victim to freak accidents or familial scheming. Of particular note is Claudius, who was expressly forbidden from holding public office by both Augustus (his step-grandfather) and Tiberius (his uncle), only to be installed as emperor after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a> got sick of his nephew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>.
