You rarely see Quakers in film without this trope getting invoked  though with that religion, the definition of "preacher" gets stretched. (So does the definition of "Quaker"  they're one of the few universally pacifist denominations.)
</p><p>If the clergyman had been a soldier, policeman, or the like before taking orders, it may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a>.
</p><p>This trope does <em>not</em> apply to preachers in certain fundamentalist churches and rarely applies to priests of medieval Catholic churches.

Unlike many of the others here, he isn't a gun-toting priest, but no less badass.

The badass version dates back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">medieval legends</a>. There are even versions that have him keeping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryGuardDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryGuardDog">very large dogs</a> around to do his bidding, like attack people.
</li><li> According to Spanish tradition, one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles, James the Great, was the one responsible for spreading Christianity to the Iberian penisula and was summoned by Ramiro I to save the Spaniards during the mythical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/BattleOfClavijo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/BattleOfClavijo">Battle of Clavijo</a> against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoorishSpain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoorishSpain">Emirate of Córdoba</a>.

</li><li> An awful lot of prophet heroes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>.

Granted, he's the head of an order of monks in a Church Militant, but as Patriarch, he's expected to be more a politician and administrator than a fighter.

Even the newest curate, a retired, middle-aged, fubsy Cambridge Fellow, the Revd Professor Harry Gasceyn Levett, is a Friar Tuck sort; as is their RC counterpart Mgr Folan. And, unexpectedly enough, even the mild, museli-munching <em>Guardian</em>-reading Bishop in Salisbury  is an ex-chaplain Royal Navy.

There's also a monastery whose order comprises of nothing but current and former Mechwarriors.
</li><li> A standard character type in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">actual magical powers</a> being optional, but also valid.
</li><li> Every player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DogsInTheVineyard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DogsInTheVineyard">Dogs in the Vineyard</a></em> is a gunslinger/paladin who wanders the wild west protecting towns from demons.

<ul><li> Clerics are usually relegated to being the team Healer and general diplomatic representatives, (being preachers and all). Take the right domains, and you're filled with more Divine Wrath than a party of Paladins, even <em>if</em> your god is Olidamarra (god of trickery and general non-combatant). It helps that they have the 2nd best attack progression in the game and can cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Sodom-&amp;-Gomorrah-style spells</a> while stomping around in full-plate suits of Adamantine armor!
</li><li> And those who choose to worship someone like St. Cuthbert (the god of retribution) Heironeous (god of valor) to name just two, can kick some serious ass; clerics of both gods tend to be potent fighters. Clerics who worship Pelor (the god of the sun) aren't slouches either, and seeing as they can also have potent healing abilities, he's a popular choice.
</li><li> And if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDZilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDZilla">decide to take a little feat called Divine Metamagic (Persist Spell) and start casting Divine Power,</a>, you <strong>get</strong> the best attack progression in the game <strong>as well as</strong> casting the said death-from-on-high magic.
</li><li> Fourth Edition features the build known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic=1590.0">"Zap Cleric"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Clerics who go around, as the article puts it, "Shooting People in the Face With Lasers."
</li><li> Clerics in Fifth Edition is considered one of, if not <em>the</em> most versatile class. Because they gain power from the god they worship, they have the highest number of subclasses, and a fair number of those (such as War, Forge and Tempest) are excellent physical fighters. Even Life-domain clerics can use heavy armor and deal good damage in physical combat. And that's only the physical stuff. The Light-domain turns a cleric into a fire-and-laser-spewing war machine.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> features as the foremost example the Zenith Caste of the Solar Exalted. They have access to Presence and Performance Charms that allow them to capture the hearts and souls of their audience, spreading the word of the Unconquered Sun and his virtues. They also have access to Integrity Charms that allow them to fend off the most intense of mental assaults, Resistance Charms that turn their bodies as hard as steel, and Survival Charms that make them capable of surviving in the desert for years. Oh, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Anima</a> burns the undead. There's a reason Zeniths are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">frequently nicknamed</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuJesus">Kung-Fu Jesus</a>". Their corrupted equivalents, the Midnights (of the Abyssals) and the Malefactors (of the Infernals), are just like them, only twisted. The Midnights have the ability to raise the dead as mindless zombies and mostly serve the cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">Oblivion</a>, whereas the Malefactors follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Cecelyne the Endless Desert</a> and try to establish spiritual and physical wastelands based on the rule of strong over weak.

An Orthodox priest <em>could</em> certainly be an ex-special ops veteran or somesuch, and both willing and quite able to kick a blasphemer's sorry behind into orbit. And while the stereotypical Amalthean is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a>, it's entirely permissible for one to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">Martial Pacifist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Combat Medic</a> who focuses as much on <em>defending</em> the weak as on healing them.

Devout Evangelists believing in the everloving God? Check. Calm, unassuming men whose faithful speeches are able to hold an audience for hours? Check. Will grab holy water and a shotgun without thinking if a member of their flock is threatened by a monster? Check, check, check. On top of that, they only break out the firepower <em>if they need to</em> — they believe most monsters are capable of redemption and try to help convince them of the proper path. Then there are members of the Knights of the Brotherhood of St. George, who are an order within the Anglican Church devoted to fighting sorcerers. At least, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">until you find out what they really serve</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LastNightOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LastNightOnEarth">Last Night on Earth</a></em>, the priest class is not allowed to use guns, which normally would be pretty crippling. However, unlike other characters, he does not have to discard the "Faith" card which gives him an extra die for melee and the cards stack, which can potentially make a priest the best melee fighter in the game. He also can also sacrifice one HP to stop an event card played by zombies, which can potentially save the day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has this effect as well, as it is based on 3.5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>.

A fanatical believer and preacher of the divine, and a super-human murder machine like his Primarch brothers. That being said he was a better preacher and statesman than warlord.

Likewise Volkmar von Hindenstern, known by his sobriquet "the Grim", the Grand Theogonist (i.e. the Pope equivalent of the Sigmarite Church), who has nerves and will of solid steel and is more than capable of kicking ass either solo or at the head of an army.

First he built cathedrals on the surface. Then he designed much of the underwater city of Rapture. Then he found his faith again, and built a chapel and a devoted church membership in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism">Objectivist</a> dystopia.

One of the highlights of the game is the ability to read fiery bible passages in the middle of battle. For example riding a mine cart bible in one hand, burning dynamite in the other preaching damnation and eternal suffering. He was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">former bandit, who slaughtered his way across the West</a> before finding God, and can be summed up with this quote from the Eurogamer review:

He is one of, if not <em>the</em>, strongest characters in the story due to a combination of his great prowess at pymary, the setting's magic, and his physical combat skills that came from his time in the military. Combine that with his supernatural strength and immunity to pain due to being undead, and you have an almost unstoppable warrior. He is also one of the most devout characters in the story and was a high ranking priest before he died. Even in death he remains very devout despite his continued existence as a (sentient) zombie being considered an abomination to his religion.

</li><li> William Addison, Theodore Hardy, and Edward Mellish. All three were chaplains as well, in the British Army during WWI, and all received the Victoria Cross. How does a chaplain get a VC? They all went out into active combat areas to rescue the wounded, and Hardy died as a result in 1918. The other two lived to ripe old ages.
</li><li> In WWII we have John Weir Foote, a Canadian Army chaplain who went into the disastrous Dieppe raid. He brought wounded in to the first aid station under fire, and later carried wounded men to escape craft during the evacuation. When the time came to leave or be left, he decided to stay behind and continue helping the wounded and minister to the POWs he would soon be among. He got a Victoria cross as well.

He is still the most heavily decorated priest in American military history,
</li><li> The Dutch missionary Father Emery de Klerk. In defense of his native parishioners in the Solomon Islands he made himself something of a warlord, ambushing Japanese patrols, sending coast watching reports, and rescuing downed fliers.
</li><li> Father Emil Kapaun, a Catholic priest from Kansas who served as a chaplain in the US Army during the Korean War. Kapaun was known for selfless heroism and ensuring the survival of the other soldiers, both in combat and when he was taken prisoner by Communist forces. He eventually succumbed to pneumonia in a POW camp. He is a candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church, and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama in 2013.
</li><li> Latter-Day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley. Serving as a missionary for two years in Germany, his major temptation was not girls but studying ancient Greek. He then went home and earned a doctorate in History. During the war, even though he went through ROTC, he enlisted in the Army, became a master-sergeant in Intelligence, assigned to the elite Order of Battle and fights in the European theater with the 101st Airborne, participating the landing at Utah Beach and a number of other key battles. What did he do after the war? Research and write about theology and history, raise a family, and serve in various positions in the LDS church.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormon</a> history is full of these guys, going back all the way to Joseph Smith. Whether or not you agree with his religious teachings, it's hard not to take a look at his life and conclude that the man had a personal CMOA list big enough to fill an average-sized wiki page. For example, singlehandedly stopping a runaway carriage with several members of Congress inside, and cowing a prison guard who was boasting about the way he and his buddies tortured and abused Mormon prisoners into submission with nothing but a good, strong dressing down and sheer force of charisma. And when they finally came to assassinate him, he jumped out a second-story window <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeMeInstead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeMeInstead">to draw the mob away from two friends who were in the room with him</a>. (It worked; they both survived, one escaping <em>completely unharmed</em>.) It goes back <em>even farther</em> than Joseph Smith. A lot of the most badass guys (and some girls, too) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a> were prophets or otherwise "mighty men of God." Mormon, Moroni, Helaman, Teancum, the list goes on and on.
<ul><li> Special mention goes to Porter Rockwell, who was given the nickname "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">The Destroying Angel of Mormondom</a>." Read up on his life and you'll see that he earned it. When accused of attempting to assassinate Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs, Porter supposedly said "I never shot <em>at</em> anybody, if I shoot they get shot! ... He's still alive, ain't he?"
</li></ul></li><li> Saint Laurence, who is said to have been put to death for his faith on an iron grill. His response to the executioner?

He then prayed for Rome's conversion and died. Laurence was sentenced to death <strong>for</strong> a previous bit of badassery. He was arrested during the Valerian persecution and ordered to surrender the treasure of the church. He asked for three days to collect the treasure, and then appeared at the court with the poor, the sick, the maimed and the blind, declaring them to be "the treasure of the church" (Yes, it's only a legend)
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria">Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. During the 30 Years War, the Swedish Army in Germany was considered one of the finest war machines in the world, and historians have since lauded their King Gustavus Adolphus's methods of war as truly revolutionary against the old techniques employed by the Spanish, previously the dominant military power. Although never ordained as a priest, the Cardinal-Infante received minor orders before being assigned to govern the Spanish Netherlands, then an active warzone. Rather than setting sail from Spain, and risking attack by the fearsome Dutch navy, he led his army along the Spanish Road, through Italy and Germany. Along the way, he happened upon the Swedish army; this was the only clash of Spanish and Swedish arms in history, the old ways squared off against revolutionary new methods that would lay the foundation for tactics for the next two hundred years. His seasoned general advised the cardinal-infante not to give battle after Wallenstein refused to reinforce the army, and detached units had been depleted in prior battles. Ignoring his advisor, Ferdinand drew up his 'obsolete' tercios for battle, and utterly thrashed the Swedes in his very first battle. The Blue and Yellow regiments mounted fifteen assaults on the tercios, and were driven back each time; when the Spanish advanced, the Swedes scattered to the four winds; half the army was killed, wounded, or captured, and their general was captured. Continuing on his way to the Spanish Netherlands, Ferdinand inflicted stinging defeats on the Dutch armies, who'd also instituted revolutionary changes, and became successful enough that rumors abounded in court that he would make himself king in the Netherlands. Ultimately, it was disease, or perhaps poisoning, that defeated him last.
<ul><li> And on the Swedish side, there was Jakob Fabricius. He was the Royal Chaplain of Gustavus Adolphus. At the Battle of Lützen, the Swedish forces on his front were beginning to rout. It's reported that Fabricius gathered a few officers to him and began to sing a psalm, which prevented the rout.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruisers</a> from the Roman military who got converted to Christianity and were killed for it, whether their martyrdoms were hyperinflated or not. I.e.: Saint Sebastian, Saint Eustace, Saint Christopher, Saint George of Cappadocia, Saint Expeditus, Saint Alban...
<ul><li> The Catholic Church refers to several of these guys as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier-saint">the "Military Saints"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Curiously this includes St. Francis of Assisi, likely on the grounds of him being a member of the military before becoming a preacher, even spending some time as a captive.
</li><li> St Francis went to the Holy Land on his own to negotiate with Saladin in the middle of the Crusades. Saladin was so impressed that he invited the Franciscans back to Jerusalem. The Franciscan order is, to this day, the official custodians of the Holy Land in the Catholic Church.
</li></ul></li><li> Christian martyrs could get a whole subcategory to themselves under this trope. While most of them weren't quite as proactive in the administration of the wrath of God as the other examples on this page, it takes some serious intestinal fortitude to not only refuse to recant under threat of incredible torture or death, but even (in one memorable case) calmly singing hymns while being <em>burned alive</em>.
<ul><li> The above applies to all but two of the original Twelve Apostles. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2j26g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2j26g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2j26g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Judas hung himself shortly after his infamous betrayal, and John actually managed to live into old age.</span> St. Peter even demanded that he be crucified <em>upside-down</em> because he felt unworthy to die in the same manner as Christ. Bear in mind that crucifixion was already considered the most shameful form of execution in Rome.

He refused on principle to run in a race that was scheduled for Sunday (the 100 m), then when he was rescheduled, he made his eccentricity look awesome when he won the medal in a race (the 400 m) for which he had not properly trained.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3hgfy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3hgfy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3hgfy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">the movie version</a>.

Eric could run FAST. So fast that once when he was hungry and far from a store, he ran down a rabbit, grabbed it and took it home to cook.
</li><li> Orde Wingate. A fanatical member of the Plymouth Brethren sect, an English soldier and a Zionist warrior who modeled himself after the Old Testament Hero, Gideon. While he was not a preacher officially, he might as well have been and he fits in this trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King</a>. The man utterly pwned the state of Alabama, with just dreams and sermons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist">He never threw a punch or fired a shot.</a> "Not badass" you say?

That man intentionally brought the wrath of the Segregationist Establishment down on his head in order to expose the evils of segregation (and later militarism and systemic poverty), and he had the moral superiority not to respond to his oppressors in kind.

Wright had "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaringDownCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaringDownCthulhu">crossed a line</a> that no one could remember a black man ever crossing in Mississippi". Many historians date the Civil Rights Movement as beginning at this moment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a>. An Islamic minister and public speaker who was willing to go to war for his rights, best known for raising himself from a petty criminal and drug addict to one of the most influential voices in the Civil Rights Movement. Physically imposing, tough enough to survive in the criminal underbelly of Harlem for several years, and enough presence and willpower to make local cops, the FBI, and his own corrupt former minster terrified by his mere existence. And contrary to his reputation, all of the accomplishments came without throwing a punch, firing a shot, or using anything more violent than harsh words. Badass, indeed.
</li><li> Earl Little, Malcolm X's father, also fits the bill. Like his son, he was a minister and black nationalist activist, but a Baptist and a member of Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association. When a group of racist farmers tried to run him out of his home when Malcolm was a kid, he intentionally delayed his plans to leave the state for a year just to spite them and show that he wasn't scared.
</li><li> There are the white Southern preachers who would invite and/or openly welcome members of black congregations to participate in their services as equals, often times causing resentment and even anger in their own congregations (and danger to themselves in older times). Maybe a more passive example, but they still went against the grain on the principle that all Christians are brothers and sisters in God.
</li><li> Another in a Civil Rights movement, although <em>not</em> in America, is Desmond Tutu. He supported disinvestment of South Africa, dropping the Rand down to force the racist government to rethink their position, organized peaceful marches, and openly spoke against the position of the church on homosexuality. Awesome.

</li><li> Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, leader of the Mexican War of Independence. When the Spanish were alerted of the separatists and started to crack them down, Miguel Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and called mass, he addressed the people in front of his church, encouraging them to revolt and starting a war that lasted over a decade.
</li><li> John Chivington was an American Civil War-era minister known as the "Fighting Parson". He was a dedicated abolitionist, and he even tried to preach against slavery in the South, where such views were not exactly welcome. He had an awesome moment during one sermon where pro-slavery agitators led a mob to his church and threatened to tar and feather him. Chivington simply whipped out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">a pair of revolvers</a> and said "By the grace of God and these two revolvers, I <em>will</em> preach here today." When the Civil War broke out, he declined a position as a chaplain in favor of a combat role. He rose to become a colonel, but after the Civil War, did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and was forced to resign in disgrace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">for killing hundreds of Cheyenne women and children at the Sand Creek Massacre.</a>

To this day it maintains an almost military-style discipline among its members. This same society, noted for their extra vow of loyalty to the pope, would later grow in influence in the Catholic Church — to the point that the Protestant nations in Europe derogatorily called the Superior Generals of the Jesuits "Black Popes" due to their black robes and influence. The Jesuits were also widely acknowledged to have been the de facto intelligence agency of the Catholic Church, and a highly effective one at that.
<ul><li> Twelve Jesuit priests have been recognized by Yad Vashem as "Righteous Among the Nations" for risking their lives to rescue Jews from the Holocaust. 152 Jesuits were killed by the Nazis, who considered the order one of its most dangerous enemies (the order was specifically targeted by the Gestapo).

Quietly, he ordered the churches under his control to issue false baptism certificates to Jewish Greeks trying to escape. Thousands of Jews escaped because of his help. When the local Schutzstaffel commander threatened to execute him by firing squad in response to the letter, Damaskinos gave this sarcastic reply:
<div class="indent"><strong>Archbishop Damaskinos:</strong> According to the traditions of the Greek Orthodox Church, our prelates are hanged, not shot.

Instead at Easter 1942, they distributed a defiant circular on their position that were read to the congregations by the vicars of almost all of Norway's churches. As a consequence, all bishops and 90% of the clergymen either resigned or were deposed and got interned in labour camps.

</li><li> Martin Luther: Lived through a thunderstorm in a graveyard, went on to be one of the first to stand up to the hegemony that was the Roman Catholic Church, changing the power structure of Europe forever. He was prosecuted as a heretic and before the Diet of Worms he stated : "Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen." There's an apocryphal story that he woke up one night to see a demon standing next to his bed. He said, "Good night," rolled over, and went back to sleep. He even helped carry out an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatEscape">plot</a> to rescue a group of nuns who wished to flee their harsh, restrictive monastery in favor of the Reformist movement, by smuggling them out in herring barrels. Luther then went on to marry one of them and have several children with her.

Popular tradition has it that while at the monastery, an Ottoman Pasha visited with his troops and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">impressed by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGreek">Athanasios's good looks</a>, who took offence to the Turk's remarks (and subsequent proposal). The ensuing altercation resulted in the death of the Turkish official. Athanasios was forced to flee into the nearby mountains and become a klepht - a mountain bandit, like many others who resisted Ottoman rule. Soon afterwards he adopted the pseudonym "Diakos", or Deacon. His last battle established him as a national hero: with only 1500 men at his command he attempted to hold the bridge at Alamana near Thermopylae against an army of 8000 men who had been sent to crush the rebellion in southern Greece. Eventually most of Diakos's men fled; only 48 of them remained, and the managed to hold off the enemy for several hours before being overwhelmed. The heavily wounded Diakos was taken before the enemy commander, Omer Vryonis, who was so impressed by the former priest that he offered to make him an officer in the Ottoman army if he converted from Christianity to Islam. Diakos refused, and was executed by impalement - according to popular tradition he survived for three full days, laughing through his ordeal, until an irregular, out of pity and respect, shot him in the head.

Many clergypeople spend their lives tending the sick, but Father Damien gets a lot of extra points, because at the time, leprosy was thought to be wildly contagious, which was why people who contracted it were sent to isolated colonies and usually just left to rot (sometimes quite literally). Voluntarily going to a place that was widely believed to be certain death and hanging around the place for nearly two decades, all the while in close contact with people suffering from what was believed to be an extremely contagious, deadly disease takes some balls. And sure enough, he did eventually contract leprosy, dying of the disease in 1889.

Once, as a monk, he was attacked by four bandits whom he subdued and dragged to the church, where they instantly converted.
</li><li> In Italy, a man in a church who "claimed to hear voices" suddenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">gouged his own eyes in front of the whole church</a>. Thankfully, paramedics arrived quickly. Although many of the congregation left out of horror, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.complex.com/city-guide/2011/10/church-in-italy-shocked-by-man-gouging-out-his-own-eyes-during-mass">the priest continued mass for those remaining.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

While the story is likely somewhat apocryphal, forensic evidence shows that Nicholas did have a healed fracture in his cheekbone. This may also make him the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassSanta">Badass Santa</a>!
</li><li> When the King of Naples was overthrown by a French-inspired Jacobin faction in 1799, he fled to the safety of Palermo. Meanwhile, his advisor Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo landed at La Cortona with just eight companions and a royalist flag, and no guns or money. Within a month, Ruffo had raised an army of 17,000 men, largely peasants (known as the Sanfedisti), and waged a surprisingly effective campaign against the Parthenopaean Republic, retaking the city of Naples itself within a few months (with some assistance from a British fleet commanded by Admiral Horatio Nelson). There are a number of paintings of Cardinal Ruffo wearing what appears to be a military uniform as opposed to his cardinal's vestments, leading the Sanfedisti into battle. By all accounts, his army also contained a fair number of clergymen.
</li><li> Because of difficult and unaccessible parishes, Norway had a good lot of Badass Preachers over the years:
<ul><li> <em>Christian Kjeldstrup</em>, who singlehandedly threw a bully through a door, during the wedding of said bully.
</li><li> <em>Peder Bjørnson</em>, who had to take a parish nobody dared to handle because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a> mentality there. Bjørnson solved the problem when he manhandled the strongest man in the village and threw him down a staircase. Nobody messed with him again.
</li><li> When Kjeldstrup and Bjørnson were students, there was a brawl among the theology students resulting in the three strongest successively throwing each other out: Kjeldstrup threw out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland">Henrik Wergeland</a>, and was in turn thrown out by Bjørnson.
</li><li> <em>Petter Dass</em>, doubling as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">memetic badass</a>, for having a harsh parish on the coast of northern Norway, and writing hymns still in use. Constantly out sailing to reach his fellow men. He was said to have whipped the devil`s ass and rode on his back all the way to Copenhagen Christmas morning.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Mister Fred Rogers</a>, a Presbyterian minister who basically singlehandedly pioneered educational television out of concern that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">existing programming would rot brains</a>. Mister Rogers once spoke up against the US Senate's threat to cut funding for public television, and in six minutes of quietly explaining his show, persuaded them to double it instead. His show, meanwhile, approached children on a level that demonstrated and encouraged integrity and respect, as well as curiosity and imagination, and was known to deal with themes such as divorce, violence, and even <em>death</em> (Rogers refused to employ a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> when his died, and he had a special episode after the assassination of John F. Kennedy to explain the situation to children).
</li><li> During the Carlists wars, some Navarran villages organized themselves in army led by their Vicar.
</li><li> Reggie White was an ordained Baptist minister. He was also one of the most ferocious and feared defensive lineman in his 15-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> career during the 1980s and 1990s, granting him the nickname "The Minister of Defense."
</li><li> Speaking of the NFL, Nick Foles, who quarterbacked the Philadelphia Eagles to victory in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> LII (2017 season, 2018 game), is on his way to becoming this trope. He's currently studying for the ministry.
</li><li> Johan Lundby is a Church of Sweden pastor, who primarily works with the LGBTQ community. He is also a two-time world champion Military Sabre fencer and holds outdoor sparring sessions once a week all year. In Sweden. He also carved a fish symbol into his own chest with a knife because getting tattoos of Christian symbols is for wimps.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad">Muhammad</a>, the prophet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, was more or less thrust into this role. Essentially run out of his home for preaching against the patron gods of his hometown of Mecca, he led his followers to the city of Yathrib (today's Medina), negotiated a peace treaty so that they could start a new life there, and eventually converted the entire city. He then raised an army from practically nothing once his enemies in Mecca could no longer tolerate the spread of his religion, leading them in battle himself. Despite being outnumbered and out-gunned, defeated them and conquered the city.
</li><li> Fr. José Reyes Vega was a general who fought and died in the Cristero War against the Calles Regime in Mexico in the 1920s. He took up arms among rebels in response to the socialist revolutionary government's pogrom of religious persecution - vandalism, theft, mass arrests, and killing priests by summary execution or outright assassination. He lead his army to victory in the Battle of Tepatitlán at the cost of his own life.
</li><li> Blessed <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Popieluszko">Jerzy Popieluszko<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a Catholic priest in Communist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Poland</a>, who became a staunch ally of Lech Walesa's Solidarity trade union. As such he took part of the strikes of 1981, used his sermons to protest against the Communist goverment, and stood his ground despite all the intimidation tactics used by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>. He only "stopped" when said Police kidnapped, tortured and killed him in October of 1984.
</li><li> Charles J. Watters, Chaplin (Major) U.S. Army Was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery exhibited while rescuing wounded men in the Vietnam War, specifically the Battle of Dak To.
</li><li> Mychal Judge, O.F.M. a Franciscan friar and Catholic priest who served as a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department. He died in the line of duty — the first certified fatality of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 - being killed by falling debris from the collapsing World Trade Center's South Tower, which he had entered it to administer aid to the rescuers, injured, and dead. Prior to that, he had been a fearless missionary, ministering to New York's homeless, drug addicts, and AIDS patients at a time when they were viewed with derision by the Church and society at large.
</li><li> Francis L. Sampson Major General U.S. Army Catholic Priest who served as regimental chaplain for the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the 101st Airborne Division and parachuted into France with them on D-Day and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in France aiding the wounded.

</li><li> Said Nursi was a Kurdish preacher in the Ottoman Empire, and the author of one of the most comprehensive commentaries on the Qu'ran in existence. He was not only a theologian, but also a scientist, and said to have had a memory so exceptional that he could recall the exact page and paragraph of any sentence he studied just once. He became famous for his open defiance of the Ottoman government, which felt threatened by his push for education reforms and religious freedom. He also fought in WWI, during which he was captured and interned in a Siberian POW camp, but broke out and made his way back to Istanbul. <em>On foot</em>.
</li><li> Father Joseph O'Callahan, Jesuit priest and a United States Navy chaplain. He was awarded the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during and after an attack on the aircraft carrier aboard which he was serving, the USS Franklin (CV-13). USS Franklin had been hit by two bombs by a Japanese bomber in 1945, as was furiously in fire. His prompt actions saved lives of more than 700 men on the hangar deck and lower decks, earning him the Congressional Medal of Honor. The actions of the skipper on the ship, Captain Leslie E. Gehres, fit better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">on another trope</a>.
</li><li> Branse Burbridge, the highest scoring RAF night fighter pilot in WWII. He had a fellow theologician as his radar operator onboard his Mosquito, and he became an ordained priest after WWII. He considered shooting down three V1 flying bombs being his most worthy deed in WWII.
</li><li> St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort was a French priest and mystic who is <em>extremely</em> influential in the Catholic Church; no less than seven popes and three religious orders were shaped by his spirituality. He was also hell-on-wheels in a fight. Most famously, he put an end to a bar brawl that was disturbing one of his sermons by beating the tar out of the offenders. They were so impressed by his toughness that they followed him back to the church and listened as he finished his sermon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a>, in addition to being a championship boxer, was also a member of the paramilitary arm of the Nation of Islam, the Fruit of Islam, which had preaching responsibilities in addition to security. In the mid-1970s, he left the NOI for mainstream Islam. When he wasn't boxing, he would also sometimes go on preaching tours to share his vision of Islam with audiences. He once said that his goal was to be the "Muslim Billy Graham" when he retired from boxing, but unfortunately his development of Parkinson's Disease prevented that dream from becoming a reality.
</li><li> Lawrence of Brindisi was an Roman Catholic priest that served as battle chaplain for the Holy Roman Empire and lead an army marching on front, armed only with <em>a crucifix</em>.
