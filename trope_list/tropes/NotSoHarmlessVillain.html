That said, he's also a Perfect-level<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fej6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fej6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fej6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">called "Ultimate-level" in the dub</span> Digimon, leagues more powerful than the previous antagonist Devimon, and before Agumon becomes MetalGreymon, he pounds the heroes silly in each encounter. His debut alone marks him as this type of villain, as he's shown to be a goofy-looking guy capable of destroying an entire village with a single attack while also de-powering the heroes and he has got a network that allows him to observe the entire continent Server. The only reason he never manages to kill the children and their Digimon is because of a series of very bad luck rather than incompetence. He's also one of the few enemies to come back from the dead and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">take a level in badass</a> to become MetalEtemonall while rocking' it out.

Since both of them are Perfect-level Digimon, the heroes' Digimon are only able to fight them when they Jogress Evolve<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jnwb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jnwb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jnwb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">DNA Digivolve</span>, but if they are any level below the duo, both will definitively dominate them. Archnemon is still capable of creating Dark Tower Digimon and is practically the mother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a> BlackWarGreymon (who she can't control) and it is shown that her mere presence is enough to make Dark Towers prevent Digimon from evolving. They also manage to build Dark Towers across the entire Real World, resulting Digimon to travel to the Real World who are all causing havoc. While that plan is ultimately foiled in the end thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">Next Tier Power-Up</a>, both of them carry out their boss's other plan and kidnap children in Tokyo while the heroes are busy fighting Digimon outside Japan. When they show up with all those children, Ken is stuck with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>: a) either he stays with his friends and ignores the threats of the two villainous parties, b) he goes with Demon<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4hs6q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4hs6q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4hs6q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Daemon</span> whose minions have shown to be rather unimpressive except for SkullSatamon, or c) go with Archnemon and Mummymon who appear less serious than Demon, but have an established evil history and have actual hostages.
</li><li> Impmon is a deconstructed version of this trope.

Oh, and he's also got a really powerful Devil Fruit ability that allows him to get the drop on anyone and pound them into oblivion before they know what's hit them.

Furthermore, whatever hits they receive while they're slowed down will be delayed until the fruit's effects wear off, causing all those attacks to hit <em>all at once</em>. Thanks to this ability, low blows, and cheap shots, he was able to beat the living daylights out of Luffy, and even came close to actually defeating him a few times.

It is indicated early on that, while they are dangerous in large numbers, they have the size and strength of a small child, and are typically fodder for experienced adventurers. However, for a party of four inexperienced adventurers (that is to say, most starting adventurers), a nest of goblins turn out to be a terrifying force that easily overwhelms them exactly because they failed to take the threat they represented seriously. The adventurers guild even mentions that this is pretty much standard procedure: Newbie adventurers take goblin quests because they don't seem that difficult, while more experienced ones don't do them because of the pitiful reward. The adventurers go in, manage to kill a few goblins and get slaughtered (and females are raped to breed more goblins), another group goes in and kills a few more goblins and gets slaughtered, and only when the third or fourth group come in are the goblins dead. Most of them; those that survive might actually <em>learn</em> something and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">grow into a different, much more dangerous sort of goblin</a>.

She looks like a plush doll, and not even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll">creepy kind</a>, and Mami utterly annihilates both her and her minions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then the witch enters her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily">second form</a>.

But in <em>Rogues Revenge</em> you can clearly see that just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a> does not mean that they are not a serious threat.

Meanwhile, the other team members (not counting Bizarro), Black Manta, Sinestro, and Black Adam are heavyweights who overlook him.

He then demonstrates that it's also voice-activated, promptly freezing Quick's right leg, before shattering it and killing him.

</li><li> Larfleeze seems like just a wacky loon who never does anything beyond stealing anything that looks shiny to him. He's also the only member of the Orange Lanterns. Sounds harmless enough right? Except being the sole Orange Lantern also means he's the sole wielder of the Orange Light's power, making him <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot">one of the most powerful ring wielders in the universe</a></em>. And he's not just a loon, he's dangerously mentally unstable and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">an explosive temper</a>; he tends to respond to attempts to steal his precious loot with utterly psychotic bouts of violence. He's the only Orange Lantern because <em>he killed all the others to get their stuff</em>. The Green Lantern Corps are rightfully careful when dealing with him.
</li></ul></li><li> Though he wasn't completely harmless before, Doctor Destiny was always a traditional silver age villain, using dream powers to mess with gravity and create chaos while not really killing anyone. Cut to The 24 Hours story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> #6.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em> villains have a tendency to do this, most notably Doc Seismic and the Lizard League. Both of them were jokes on their first appearance and Not So Harmless At All after that. Doc Seismic is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> with a glass jaw, but can still do a ton of damage with his inventions and clever planning until he's restrained. The Lizard League are a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalThemedSuperbeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalThemedSuperbeing">Animal Themed Superbeings</a> who don't pose any threat to Invincible... but then, neither does almost anyone else on Earth. They can still do a lot of damage when Invincible is unavailable.
</li><li> The Intelligencia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FallOfTheHulks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FallOfTheHulks">Fall of The Hulks</a></em>. The team is made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MODOK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MODOK">M.O.D.O.K.</a>, Leader, Wizard, Red Ghost, and Mad Thinker. Together they have become a pretty deadly force. How deadly, you ask? They managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">out gambit</a> <em>Doctor freakin' Doom</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay">Brand New Day</a></em> recasts C- and D-list loser villains into competent and credible threats. The Spot comes back as a vengeful psychopath who slowly drives his prey insane by stalking him, while the White Rabbit is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> drug dealer who's willing to commit mass murder to collect the money she's owed. This also applies to classic Lee-Ditko-Romita villains like Electro, the Shocker, and the Rhino, who have all been rehabilitated from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> they've suffered.
<ul><li> Shocker invokes this trope. Hes far from harmless and is a dangerously competent supervillain, but hes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> who prefers to stay under the radar because it makes it easier for him to steal and so that he doesnt end up a target for bigger superheroes like the Avengers or psycho vigilantes like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> who would shoot him on sight. He also regards heroes as a professional hazard instead of the hatred most villains regard them with; however, if you betray him, Shocker has no problem showing you how dangerous he really is.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mysterio">Mysterio</a>, with his silly costume and somewhat weak 'powers' often comes off as something of a joke, but every now and then he pulls off something big, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">driving Daredevil so insane he almost murders an infant</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using a robotic avatar to muck around in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe, including killing their version of the Kingpin</span>, and perhaps his biggest (if unofficial because of it happening in a glorified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OldManLogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OldManLogan">deed</a>: being the one to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroy the X-Men to the last man, using Wolverine as a catspaw and assassin</span>. Oddly enough, none of these actually happened to his main enemy Spider-Man, which suggests that perhaps ol' Fishbowl Head should go find himself a new arch-enemy (though it's worth noting that Mysterio disguised himself as a psychiatrist and nearly drove Spider-Man insane in one of his earliest appearances).
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> villain the Living Laser was such a joke, everyone (even other villains) called him "the Living Loser". Eventually, however, his abilities were amplified by Count Nefaria, and even though this was temporary, it eventually turned him into a being of photons, making him far more dangerous and a true threat.
</li><li> There once was a low-level biomage named Fleshmaster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered">Empowered</a></em>. After being humiliated by his peers, he finally dared to use his powers on himself, and returned as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the new superhero dWARf!. But since he was still being pissed off, he cooked up a really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>-worthy scheme. Which was about killing all his peers at the same place where they once had humiliated them, the Capeys Awards</span>.
</li><li> Catman has received this treatment in spades, courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix">Secret Six</a></em>. Essentially, he went from a fat slob with a cat gimmick to a sociopathic, lion-pride-leading, muscly badass somewhere in the Sahara with his insignia carved into his chest (by his own hand!) and a pair of razor claws.
</li><li> Doctor Light was an incompetent villain for a long time. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em> it was revealed that the League wiped his mind and deliberately turned him into a joke after he raped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElongatedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElongatedMan">Elongated Man</a>'s wife. He recovered and takes on the Titans. All of them.
</li><li> Yellow Bastard of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> fame had this moment in his eponymous story. He was believed to have been comatose and missing a hand (among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">other body parts</a>) and was no longer a threat. He comes back as a yellow, disfigured freak bent on revenge.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Yellow Bastard:</strong> Recognize me, Hartigan? Huh? Do ya? Recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop? I look different but I bet you can recognize my voice!
</div></li><li> In a lot of the Marvel/DC crossovers, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> characters of one universe would always be looked down upon by the living god characters of the other. One particular example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> is following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a> as he's being transported to a prison across the country; along the way it passes through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Gotham City</a>, and Bats is <em>very</em> displeased with having the wall-crawler on his turf. However, Cassidy figures out a way to escape and goes bloody crazy at a time that the Joker also happens to be active, and rather unintentionally the heroes end up switching their villains. Carnage laughs off the Bat until he's taken down with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">expert planning,</a> and Spider-Man really, really doesn't seem to perceive Joker as a physical threat, but Joker just won't <em>stop</em>, and dances happily across the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> numerous times. After realizing just how similar he really is to Cassidy, down to hallucinating Joker's smile as Carnage's symbiot-grin, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">almost beats Joker to death</a> before Batman gets him to stop. Really, through the whole thing, nobody took anyone else seriously before the ass-kicking started except Batman.
</li><li> Baby Face Finlayson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em> was a harmless villain in his early appearances in the 70s and 80s but he became not so harmless in Kev F Sutherland's strips in the 2000s where the character reached almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> status.
</li><li> The Condiment King in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">Canon Immigrant</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, the Condiment King is usually treated as a throwaway, joke villain but in <em>Robin</em> #171 (April 2008), (after Poison Ivy had given him some tips on mixing spices in Arkham) Robin observes that the villain is potentially dangerous (he had just attempted to detonate a mustard gas bomb inside a mall, and his condiment guns could cause anaphylactic shock), but his ludicrous nature prevents the justice department from taking him seriously.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>'s villain Reactron. In his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005">Post-Crisis</a> attack on her, Supergirl disposes of him quickly and notes that for a guy with near limitless power, Reactron isn't thinking very big, or using his powers very intelligently. Then he gets modified and given a new Kryptonite-powered armor in the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewKrypton">New Krypton</a></em>, and proceeds to nearly kill Kara Zor-El several times, as well as murder her parents and her whole race.

<ul><li> The final enemy Superman faces is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mr. Mxyzptlk, who has gotten bored of playing pranks and decided to be truly evil</span>. An interesting subversion in that he's only harmless by choice, and when he goes for it he becomes a threat so nightmarish that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Superman of all people is forced to break his non-killing code</span>.
</li><li> Prankster, Toyman and Bizarro go from harmless nuisances to murderous monsters. Bizarro, in particular, stands out, destroying the Bizarro World and then decimating Metropolis.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a>'s run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> has been doing this with Jester. For years, he was nothing more than a C-list Joker knockoff that no one took seriously, in-universe or out. Now he is a diabolical mastermind with a love of chaos and a need to make Matt's life hell. Culminated with him cheerfully crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">makes Foggy Nelson hang himself just to spite Matt</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a></em> takes Arcade and makes him a genuine threat. By the end of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">half the kids in Murderworld are dead, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">has escaped without punishment</a></span>. Zig-zagged in the aftermath in that nobody else in the super-villain or superhero community still respects him because A) it is explicitly pointed out that his grand scheme to "become a threat" is a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> rip-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em> by them (Arcade also said it was so, but he saw it as 'inspiration') and B) in order for it to work out as well as it did, he had to go after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickOnSomeoneYourOwnSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickOnSomeoneYourOwnSize">teenagers</a></em>, so the ones who are not disgusted in an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>" fashion mock him because they think that he went after "easy" targets. As such, he spends his appearances afterward whining about still not being respected before the teenagers that survived find him and give him the most humiliating vengeance they can devise.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorWhoFourDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorWhoFourDoctors">Doctor Who: Four Doctors</a></em>, the Voord, one of the show's most memetically notorious unimpressive monster species, become a genuine universe-level threat thanks to teaming up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an evil alternate version of the Twelfth Doctor</span>.
</li><li> This is turning into a trend in the Titan <em>Doctor Who</em> crossover events, as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorWhoSupremacyOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorWhoSupremacyOfTheCybermen">Doctor Who: Supremacy of the Cybermen</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the previously-ineffectual incarnation of Rassilon from "Hell Bent"</span> teamed up with the Cybermen to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">try to destroy the universe and recreate it with himself as its creator God</span>, and only failed because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">inevitably tried to stab him in the back</a>.

</li><li> The villain Madcap debuted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em> and spent most of his tenure as a wacky comic relief D-lister. Then he was accidentally merged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em>, who's mind drove him from comical insanity to not-so-comical. After being expelled from Deadpool's body, Madcap set about making the mercenary's life hell, including such acts as brainwashing innocent civilians into feeding themselves to a tiger, or infecting Deadpool with a virus so that he would pass it on to his young daughter and her adopted family and be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a> them die.

</li><li> Rinkus from <em>The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire</em>.

Among their misdeeds throughout the film, they initiate the public humiliation Quasimodo goes through, subdue Phoebus when he turns on Frollo and were inches away from executing him before Esmeralda interfered. Brutish Guard in particular is responsible for setting off the entire second half of the film when he discovers Esmeraldas escape offscreen and reports it to Frollo.
</li><li> Mr. Tweedy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenRun">Chicken Run</a></em> spends much of the movie as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">Henpecked Husband</a> to Mrs. Tweedy, but he's also stopped <em>every one</em> of the chicken's escape attempts, and when Mrs. Tweedy tells him to get a chicken to test out the pie machine, Mr. Tweedy comes back with Ginger, having correctly identified her as the chickens' leader.

This verdict then at first appears justified, when their inexperienced air force underperforms despite superior technology.

<ul><li> At first baronet William Rosenthal seems to be just an obnoxious and racist young noble who planned to make a career in the Royal Navy thanks to his nobility and hated lord Guillonk's guest (actually Sandokan, found near dead and healed by Guillonk and family after a bad run-in with a British cruiser) because he wasn't English. He's in fact obnoxious and a little racist even for the European norm of the time, but he's the captain of the cruiser that had nearly killed Sandokan, and that didn't actually hate him until he realized where he had already seen him. There's even a good chance he had been the one who actually wounded Sandokan in that battle...
</li><li> Sindhia, the Rajah of Assam and Surama's cousin who sold her to the Thuggee. He's initially presented as an idiot and a borderline madman, depending on his adviser Teotokris for actual rule. Yet he easily disposed of his predecessor by duping him into not killing him immediately and giving him a gun, and upon breaking out of the asylum he had been sent after being deposed he practically dethroned Yanez by stealing him most of his popular support and building an army under his nose, only losing due Sandokan showing up with a Plague Master. Also, comparing the approximate date of his accession to the Assam throne with Real Life events, he actually extended his dominion, somehow taking back the whole Assam from the British East India Company (who had come to conquer the whole Assam and restored the previous dinasty in Upper Assam only).

Later in the novel, he comes back as a dangerous gang leader in Paris who manages to kidnap and threaten Valjean, breaks out of prison, attempts to break into Valjean's house with his gang, and demands payment from Valjean to let him leave the sewer and save Marius's life... while also knowing that he'll end up running into Javert, who's lying in wait outside.

<ul><li> Warren and the other Nerds of Doom. At first, they're kind of silly with their arguments over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> and the best actor to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a>, and their kinda weird attempts to challenge Buffy in ways that, really, were nothing compared to five seasons of big bads and various monsters of the week. Warren stops being funny when he tries to rape his ex via mind control and kills her when she tries to escape, and near the end of the season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he shoots Buffy and murders Tara Maclay</span>. Then one of the other nerds, Andrew, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills Jonathan,</span> proving himself not just a source of comic relief.
</li><li> The Mayor. At first, he seems like a self-serving politician tapping into supernatural powers for personal gain. Then it turns out he commands a small army of vampires and plans to become a pureblood demon. Oh, and he's also invulnerable; not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>, <em>invulnerable</em>.
</li><li> This becomes Spike's hat in Season 4. Buffy and company get used to thinking of him as harmless thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">chip implanted in his head that prevents him from physically attacking any humans</a>, but he occasionally shows them that he could still cause them problems or even get them all killed, even if he can't attack them directly.
<ul><li> When Faith wakes up from her coma and plans to go on a rampage against the group, Giles and Xander run into Spike, and because he's lived with them, fought demons together with them a few times, and generally been unable to harm them, they make the mistake of assuming he'll be an ally. They ask him if he's heard anything about Faith, and Spike feigns concern, which makes them fill him in on the whole Faith situation (as Spike has never seen or heard of Faith before) complete with a physical description and the fact that she's looking for vengeance against the group. With this information in hand, Spike announces that he's going to find the rogue Slayer so he can tell her where they are so he can watch as Faith kills them. And thanks to their assumption that he's harmless, he even has a rough description of the person he should be looking for.
<div class="indent"><strong>Spike:</strong> What do you need? <br/><strong>Xander:</strong> Her. Dark hair, [raises a hand to about Faith's height] ye tall, name of Faith, criminally insane. <br/><strong>Spike:</strong> Is this bird after you? <br/><strong>Xander:</strong> In a <em>bad</em> way, yeah. <br/><strong>Spike:</strong> Tell you what I'll do then: head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where all of you are, then watch as she kills you. [<em>Spike smiles at Xander and Giles, then sighs in annoyance at their shocked expressions</em>] Can anyone in your damn little Scooby club at least try to remember that I <em>hate</em> you all. Just 'cause I can't do the damage myself doesn't stop me from aiming a loose cannon your way.
</div></li><li> Near the end of Season 4, he manipulates the existing tensions within Buffy's friends and successfully gets them to turn against one another.
</li></ul></li><li> When Harmony shows up in Season 5 with her own pack of vampires, the heroes can't take her seriously. Unfortunately, in the midst of taunting her, Dawn mistakenly invites her into her house, and we are reminded that while Harmony may be incompetent, she is still a vampire. Indeed, the minute she finds out that Harmony has minions, Buffy laughs her ass off but quickly changes her tune when she discovers that Dawn invited Harmony in, gathering a small arsenal of weapons and stakes. Then in season 8, she kills a Slayer with her own stake on national television <em>and</em> convinces the public that vampires are the good guys and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">Slayers are the bad guys</a>, sending the US Military after them. All this from the seemingly brainless vampire that Buffy and Angel repeatedly refused to kill because they didn't see her as much of a threat.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> plays with this in regards to Daniel Holtz, a vampire hunter desiring revenge on Angel and Darla for destroying his life. Angel and Darla were always afraid of him but still didn't think of him as that much of a threat. When Holtz reappears in the present day, Angel and Darla realize just how dangerous he really is.

After about six seasons of being sidelined, outmaneuvered, and humiliated by the other players of the Game, Cersei snaps and has all of her rivals in King's Landing wiped out with wildfire before usurping the Iron Throne as Queen.

At first, she's Big Bad Scorpius' spoiled daughter and spends most of the time whining or backstabbing the villains who do know what they're doing in order to rise in the ranks. Eventually, she leaves, eventually meets up with an old ally of her dad, and gets some combat training. The real fun begins when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>, Deviot, arranges Scorpius' death and succeeds. Trakeena returns to take his place... and the new, badder Trakeena is worse than her dad ever was.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Daleks are a meta-example. While they were always a threat and other characters rarely reacted with anything but terror, their numerous appearances over the original series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">twenty-six year run</a> heavily diluted any fear to be had from the motorised pepper pots. Thus the new series episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E6Dalek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E6Dalek">Dalek</a>" was written with the sole intention of showing a new generation that the Daleks were Not So Harmless, with a single imprisoned, crippled, powerless Dalek killing hundreds of people effortlessly.
<ul><li> On a lesser scale with the Daleks in First Doctor stories. In their third story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E8TheChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E8TheChase">The Chase</a>" they had the potential to become really dangerous when they acquire time travel and pursue the Doctor. However they come across as quite laughable here, one Dalek struggling over a simple math problem, falling over, and getting beaten by Funhouse robots. In their next appearances, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan">The Daleks' Master Plan</a>" and its teaser episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E2MissionToTheUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E2MissionToTheUnknown">Mission to the Unknown</a>" they came very close to conquering the Solar System and other Galaxies, and two companions die during the story.

While never exactly <em>harmless</em>, his appearance here (after a lengthy hiatus) portrayed him less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemy</a> and more a ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>, happy to tear the universe apart to save his own skin. In his next appearance, though his main plan is stopped, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">ends up getting a new body</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">taking over</a> a rather nice character. In the story after that, he goes on a killing spree and causes the Fourth Doctor's death.
</li><li> This was the intention with the Cybermen in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E6Earthshock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E6Earthshock">Earthshock</a>", after their poorly-received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E5RevengeOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E5RevengeOfTheCybermen">last appearance</a> seven years earlier.

Tom spends most of the series as a placeholder for vice president or opposition, and Gaeta watching the radar. They eventually lead a coup against Adama and Roslin.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> has a pair of polite bank robbers. They walk in, request the money, say thank you, and walk out. They are even polite enough to hold doors open for people. Really harmless robbers with a cutesy nickname, or so people think until Charlie predicted their target and Don and a team tries to arrest them. That is when they demonstrated that not having needed to call for backup is not the same as not having backup, and not having needed to use violence is not the same as being unwilling to use violence. Turns out they are ex-special forces working to a deeper plan and perfectly happy to use assault rifles, car bombs, and expertly knife a janitor that gets in the way — just hadn't needed to before.
</li><li> Marlo Stanfield's first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> is very unassuming (blink and you'll miss it).

The Ha'taks themselves were for a number of seasons considered nothing more than a joke. And why not? The Lucian Alliance are not the Goa'uld, they're human (most of them) and have as much ingenuity as Earth-bound humans.

<ul><li> In sports, the "Wounded Tiger" and "Ewing" theories both assert that a team known for one or two-star players is more likely to thrive when said star(s) are not playing. The point being that opposing teams will write them off as they would a wounded tiger, not realizing that a wounded tiger is a very dangerous creature. So for instance, when Deron Williams is nursing an injury, either watch out for the New Jersey Nets or prepare to be baffled and ashamed in defeat; the wounded tiger is on the prowl. Similarly, after LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal left them in the summer, the now-starless Cleveland Cavaliers opened the 2010-2011 season... by beating last season's runner-up squad, the Boston Celtics. This was both an incredible upset and a slap in the face to LeBron, whose Miami Heat had lost to the Celtics the day before, and Shaq, who now played for the Celtics. And shortly after breaking a record-setting losing streak, the "Cleveland Cadavers" showed they were still alive... by beating the previous year's <em>champions</em>, the LA Lakers. And about a month later, <em>they beat the Heat</em>.

In 5th Edition, all of that got retconned into having not happening (like pretty much every other change 4th Edition made) but Cyric is still treated as a legitimately threatening god.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> adventure, <em>Burnt Offerings</em>, the players fend off an attack from goblins that act like pyromaniac 5th-graders who injure themselves as often as their opponents. But weeks after the raid, they discover a goblin who ran and hid under a house, where he slowly went mad from hunger and isolation and <em>killed and ate a man who tried to stop him doing the same to his child</em>.

</li><li> "The Bandits of Bunglewood" from <em>Dungeon Adventures 51</em> seems to be inspired by Tucker's Kobolds. The eponymous Bandits are kobolds who have gotten more training than the typical ones, and investigating their misdeeds is difficult because nobody is willing to admit they were beaten up and robbed by mere kobolds.

To put it another way: most supernatural effects have damage, targeting, and so on that scale with "power" dots (gnosis, etc) plus stat dots plus "skill" dots (sphere ranks, renowns, etc) and occasionally some miscellaneous dots from a third pool.

Before the Horus Heresy, the Iron Warriors legion got repeatedly shit on and disrespected, being treated as semi-expendable workhorses and given all the most brutal garrison and siege duties without being recognised for their contributions to the final victory or even really being thanked. When Horus turned traitor, the Iron Warriors followed; they gleefully dismantled the Imperial defences during the Siege of Terra and wrecked much of the Imperial Palace, and then nearly massacred their rivals the Imperial Fists. Now they're one of the most ruthless and terrifying Chaos Space Marine legions in the entire galaxy, valuing nothing beyond their hatred and their means of expressing it.

<ul><li> Individually, Murlocs aren't much of a threat. They're about two feet tall aquatic humanoids of limited intelligence. However they are rarely found individually. They are usually in large social groups and will come to the defense of one another, and almost always flee at low health; returning with several more. They are extremely deadly at low levels where several quests require killing them. Many a new player has made the mistake of laughing at the little fish man with the incoherent grumbling growling noise. Then that player finds themselves facing a dozen or more and is overwhelmed quickly. Murlocs were finally patched in the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion to be easier to kill and not summon as much help, but they can still overwhelm an unlucky or unprepared player.
</li><li> Deathwing's attack on Stormwind was probably <em>intended</em> to be this, a way to showcase him as a major threat who could do serious damage to the Alliance and the Horde after the previous expansion's antagonist, the Lich King, was called a Saturday morning cartoon villain by the fanbase one to many times. But this attack happens almost entirely offscreen, is barely mentioned after the fact, didn't kill anyone important, and has never been given any (canon) reasoning as to why he chose Stormwind and only took out the park when he apparently could have leveled the entire city.

Then, at the beginning of <em>Reconstruction</em>, a shell-shocked Red soldier named Walter explained to Command over what went down after the Blues at Valhalla scavenged Tex's crashed pelican (see the ending to the Blood Gulch Chronicles).

As Redcloak puts it: "I know he seems funny and charming, but believe me, when you see for yourself the depths to which he'll sink, you will never sleep well again."
</li><li> Qarr the imp is a definite case of playing with a trope.

Fans went into a flurry of speculation about this mysterious new being, but nobody expected him to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImp">a tiny imp</a> with virtually no power of his own and who isn't even all that bright.

Thief actually states that he would stop BM if anything BM did would hurt anyone more than himself. And then, towards the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he calmly takes out all 4 fiends (perhaps the most powerful and certainly the evilest creatures on the planet) AND the other 3 members of the Light Warriors (all also ridiculously powerful- a warrior who can block anything and kill anything that bleeds, a ninja who can dodge anything, including ethereal energies, and a mimic who can cast every spell the universe has ever seen) with simple ease. Course, then Sarda appears and reverts everything</span>.
</li><li> Garland is shown to be utterly incompetent as a villain- he simply has no idea how to hurt anyone, and for that matter really doesn't want to. His Dark Warriors consist of a dark elf who would be exceptionally useful if he had his swords (which were stolen by the Light Warriors and which take him almost the entire story to get back), and who is utterly useless without them; a pirate who can't read, write, do anything nautical, or really anything useful; and a goth vampire who is obsessed with roleplaying and spends his time writing poetry. When they tire of his inept leadership, though, we get a sight of the real Garland; he offers to cater the meeting they have about getting rid of him; when Drizz'l, the dark elf, asks him why he would cater a meeting specifically designed to screw him over, he delivers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> stating how useless the other Dark Warriors are, and informs him that all the food is spiked with amnesia peppers and that everyone will forget the whole idea in an hour or so. It was also shown that he could summon giant monsters (although not controlling them) and took part in killing the Yeti the Dark Warrior met.
</li><li> Hilariously averted with the cultists; after their first plan to destroy the universe ends terribly at the hands of the Light Warriors, they come back a few hundred strips later seeming much more competent; they see through Black Mage's disguise like a window, lock of the rest of the Light Warriors, and actually set up the summoning ritual for the monster that will end the universe. It seems like a massive threat to the universe and the Light Warriors. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then Black Mage kills them all with his knives in a few seconds and summons the monster, who immediately dies to Red Mage (by accident, no less).</span>

</li><li> The Ice King is usually played as a demented old fool, but being a tall order comedic sociopath, he is dangerous at times.

He also proved useful under benevolent purposes, helping Finn defeat the Lich. The most overt example of this in the series happens in "Princess Monster Wife", in which in his first major appearance after "Holly Jolly Secrets" revealed his tragic past and made the audience feel sorry for him, he chopped bits off several women to make himself a wife. "Finn the Human" showed that his crown is powerful enough to freeze the planet for centuries on end and it would overpower a normal person's mind into doing just that in a matter of minutes. The only reason the Ice King remains mostly harmless is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside">a tiny remnant of his original personality is still resisting it</a>.

Seeing as this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Sonic</a> we're talking about, Robotnik always proved too slow and didn't manage to get a single Emerald ... until the very last one.

However, several times over the course of the series he's truly endangered Dunwyn through his schemes, and in the series finale actually <em>conquers</em> the kingdom, losing at the end of the finale notwithstanding. It's also clear that if it hadn't been for the Gummi Bears, he would have taken over Dunwin a long time ago. Even if most people now believe that the Gummi Bears only are fairy-tale characters, they remain a threat to Duke Igthorn, that the king's knights only can dream of being.

<ul><li> Peridot plays with this as her very first appearance carried a lot of threat with the first reveal of an unknown enemy out there with its sights set on earth. In her first direct interaction with the group, however, she's shown to be rather immature and a bit pathetic. Despite this, she does consistently prove to be a problem until she begins her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.

When they first appear they're easily fooled by the Crystal Gems and act like gullible children, with Eyeball mostly just growling and giving everyone dirty looks. "Back to the Moon" reveals that she's a veteran of the Gem war and is much more violent and unhinged than her comrades as she tries to murder Steven while trapped in space.
</li><li> Navy looks like a bubbly fool even by Ruby standards, and in "Room for Ruby" she wants to join the Crystal Gems, acting all sugary and lovey-dopey toward Steven and Earth...then she drops the act and reveals herself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Manipulative Bitch</a> that tricked Steven that whole time, playing on his naïvety and the image of the Rubies as cute idiots, stealing the spaceship back and getting revenge over the Crystal Gems fooling them before.

In fairness, he never counts on Raven's dark side taking over and terrifying him. In Season 5's episode "Kole", we see that without Trigon's influence on his daughter, Dr. Light is more of a challenge, nearly defeating the Titans in the process.

And following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> reboot in later seasons, he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">a minor</a>, but more fearsome role.

</li></ul></li><li> In a meta sense, the Shredder gets less and less harmless with every incarnation. The original is dead in one issue. The '87 cartoon version, as described above, has his moments, but spends most of his time arguing with Krang as if they were married(his voice actor confirmed it was actually intentional). The Movie version was a deadly combatant, but got angry and unfocused easily, leading to his defeats. Then came the 2k3 version, a thousand-year-old alien who took the myth of a demon and used it to control the criminal underworld into modern day, and was a fierce enough combatant to cripple the turtles ON-SCREEN. So did the human, but possibly even more depraved and terrifying 2012 version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>: When Starscream made a bunch of clones, they all set to bickering, and their personalities really affected how they fought (Skywarp was too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">Ramjet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Thundercracker</a> spent too much time talking). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Slipstream</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">Sunstorm</a>, however, were more effective, taking Bulkhead and Prowl down respectively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Decepticons from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersGenerationOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersGenerationOne">Transformers Generation One</a></em> cartoon were originally portrayed as goofy, incompetent villains who constantly lost to the Autobots every single time throughout the first two seasons, but from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">Transformers: The Movie</a></em> onwards, they actually began killing almost half the original Autobot cast! (out-of-universe, this was actually done by the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">just so they can make room for new characters, both 'Bot and 'Con alike)</a> The third and final season, as with the Japanese sequels, actually portrayed all of the 'Cons as true villains.
</li><li> Even in early seasons, there were a fair number of times the Decepticons outsmarted or overpowered the Autobots and were mere seconds away from victory. Megatron, despite his infamy as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a>, was also always just cunning enough to reverse around any of the Autobots attempts to get a long term upper hand in their war with the Decepticons (e.g. he instantly reversed around Mirage's attempt to turn them and the Insecticons against each other and also managed to steal or outmatch some of Wheeljack's gadgets such as the Immobilizer and the Dominator Disc). This inability to gain a definite control over the Decepticons led to the latter having control of Cybertron by the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> at the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, with the Autobots forced into hiding.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Monarch is thought of as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a>... until he starts killing people with poison darts and elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deathtrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deathtrap">deathtraps</a>. This appears to be situational. Against Dr. Venture and Brock Samson? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a>. Against <em>anyone else</em>? The man is <em>actually kind of scary</em>. Compare his banter with Venture(roughly paraphrasing: "At least I've driven you mad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">HAHAHA</a>") to what he says to the Moppets: (again, roughly paraphrasing: "I will feed your bodies to the dogs if you don't move NOW").
</li><li> This also applies to The Monarch's henchmen. Put them up against Brock Samson, OSI, or the minions of other supervillains, and they come off as bumbling, incompetent losers. Turn them loose on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystanders</a> on the other hand... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz4PdpfI7zY">and they're a terrifying group of well-armed killers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, albeit still not truly competent, per se.
</li><li> And Dr. Girlfriend's Murderous Moppets/the Pupa Twins, Tim-Tom and Kevin. Yeah, they're unshaven dwarfs dressed like 19th-century schoolboys, but they're also deadly hand to hand combatants. Specifically, both of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Knife Nuts</a>. They also plot against the Monarch and his henchmen for awhile.
</li><li> Sgt. Hatred seemed too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>, treating Dr. Venture very cordially after being assigned as his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy">archenemy</a>. Then he shot Doc in the stomach without provocation. They were rubber bullets, yeah, but that's just his way of "keeping it lively," which just makes it <em>way</em> worse. He is also a pedophile (A recovering one, but he has trouble controlling his urges).
</li><li> In season 4 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">21, previously an incompetent (yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>) henchman, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taken a huge level in badass</a> and has become not only by far the most competent and dangerous of The Monarch's henchman, but also the most mentally imbalanced as well. This is all because of the loss of his best (and perhaps only) friend, 24</span>.
</li><li> <em>The Venture Bros</em> in general applies this to all villains. The justification is that the villains we see are sanctioned by the Guild of Calamitous Intent, which places strict regulations on arching. OSI, the world police force, tolerates the Guild simply because they have restrictions for their members and the alternative is letting a bunch of pissed-off madmen with exotic weapons, powers, and costumes run around aimlessly.

Yet, when he wants to he can be just as evil: at the end of "The Lost Cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">Townsville</a>", he captures Mojo Jojo and is seen about to experiment on him while saying that his experiment won't kill Mojo, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">will make him wish it would</a>. He also made clear to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Kids Next Door</a> that he is not above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">harming children who get in his way</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lord Hater is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManChild">Psychopathic Man Child</a> who is obsessed with being the <em>GREATEST IN ALL THE GALAXY!!</em> While his inability to do anything about Wander has made him a laughingstock, he's still a skeleton with super strength and lightning powers, and before he met Wander had actually built up a pretty fearsome empire. When Hater goes into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>, even the normally fearless Wander knows to keep away.
</li><li> There's also the Potted Plant from "The Bounty". While it may seem like a joke compared to the other bounty hunters, it actually manages to capture Wander and Sylvia by eating them, although it makes the mistake of eating Commander Peepers as well, who escapes by cutting it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the two-part <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> episode <em>A World Without Wordgirl</em>, the titular hero, tired of missing her birthday party due to stopping villains, wishes she never was WordGirl.

<ul><li> Teenage wanna-be villain Jack Spicer, who underwent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> almost the moment he was introduced in the pilot, and quickly became a one-man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Goldfish Poop Gang</a>. At least, until the penultimate episode, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> shows that, in a timeline where the heroes weren't around to constantly thwart him, he'd defeated all the major villains who were taken more seriously than him, conquered the world, and rechristened himself the Emperor of Darkness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Hannibal Roy Bean</a> even lampshades it in his first appearance by telling Jack that he would have no problems becoming the worst villain ever if he ever learned to conquer his fears.
</li><li> Wuya spends much of her time as a harmless ghost chewing out Jack Spicer...until she regains her physical form and full power, at which point she conquers the world <em>single-handedly</em> and is nigh unbeatable. Even when resurrected in a weakened state later on, she proves extremely dangerous.

However, in one episode, he obtains the Amnesiulet, and uses it to gain the powers of the Night Master. Not only does he ransack the town with the Night Master's army, but he manages to even <em>kill Yin and Yo</em>. It's only averted thanks to Yang using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>.
