It appears to be a suicide — there might even be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodbyeCruelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodbyeCruelWorld">Goodbye, Cruel World!</a> — but no matter the evidence, resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectiveDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectiveDetective">Defective Detective</a> Bob isn't so sure. Maybe Bob is a personal friend of Alice's and can't believe she would kill herself, or maybe the evidence just doesn't add up. In any case, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a>'s warnings to let it go, Bob decides to investigate further.
</p><p>Sure enough, Bob is right. In any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeAndPunishmentSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeAndPunishmentSeries">Crime and Punishment Series</a>, people never seem to kill themselves; with a few exceptions, every apparent suicide is staged to cover up a murder. This happens as a logical consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">Always Murder</a> because simply confirming that it's a suicide is not very exciting, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">doesn't take an entire 40-minute episode</a>. Presumably the police come across a few real suicides between episodes, but if they investigate one onscreen, start looking for the killer.

Sadly, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, a lot of suicide is treated as a murder investigation, because it's easier to comprehend a loved one fell victim to a homicide than that person killing him/herself off without his/her vicinity noticing anything. Sometimes, this is done to cover up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">honor killings</a>.

Contrast this against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotMurder">Suicide, Not Murder</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotAccident">Suicide, Not Accident</a>, two common inversions where the suicide victim intentionally staged their death to look like murder or accident respectively, in order to either allow loved ones to collect life insurance or to frame the person(s) they feel are responsible for the circumstances that drove them to suicide.

</li></ul></li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em> had one. In a bit of a twist, the deaths actually were suicide, but the victims' therapist had purposely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">driven them to it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> does it often too, normally either with Booth not believing it was suicide or Brennan finding some evidence that suggests murder even if suicide would have made sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> did a subversion. Charlie, upset over the death of a student, gets Don to look into it to see if it was really suicide. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was, but in the process of investigating it they uncover another crime.</span>
<ul><li> Played straight in two later episodes, one involving an ex-girlfriend of Don's, the other an old college friend of Charlie's. In the former case, Don simply doesn't believe the victim was suicidal and asks Charlie to look into it, prompting him to discover a key piece of evidence. In the latter, Charlie is suspicious because his friend had told him she was afraid for her life and because three of her colleagues had also died in apparent accidents in the past few weeks, which Charlie knows is statistically unlikely. In both cases, it turns out that the women were killed because they knew something their killers wanted to keep secret.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em> when Crosetti dies, it's almost immediately apparent to everyone that it's a suicide (even if they'd rather not face up to it), but Lewis has a major case of denial and refuses to believe that Crosetti would kill himself, and under the cover of 'investigating' what 'really' happened attempts to undermine the investigation by tampering with witnesses. Eventually the call from the coroner comes in to confirm that it was suicide - and Lewis breaks down.
<ul><li> Double subverted later on when Beau Felton is found with his head blown off. Everyone including Lewis is sure it's suicide this time, since Felton was a troubled alcoholic whose wife had split with the kids. Then the medical examiner reconstructs the skull fragments and finds a bullet hole from a handgun in the back of his head. The killer used the shotgun to both stage it to look like suicide and obscure the actual cause of death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>
<ul><li> Subverted when an investor shoots himself at a party. It originally looks like a staged suicide since he's still holding the gun, which usually doesn't happen, as the muscles relax after death, but this guy had a rare condition that made him an exception.
</li><li> Another variation was when the villain of an arc staged identical suicides of men who were born on the same date that his father was murdered in the same manner (this was also his father's birthday). Up to and including a faked suicide note (well, tape). He did all this to prove his father's murder wasn't a suicide.
</li><li> <em>Inverted</em> in another episode when a man is found in some woods with all the evidence initially pointing towards murder... only it turns out to be an extremely elaborate suicide designed to look like a murder so his wife would receive his life insurance money.
</li><li> And subverted YET AGAIN in another episode, when one man throws himself in front of a car. The entire episode runs like an ordinary investigation, the suicide letter being the final twist, only seconds before the episode ends. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And the car's driver would've been aquitted of all charges, had he not been a narcissistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> who left the guy bleeding to death on his car's hood, thus turning a suicide into a murder, rather than the usual vice versa.</span>
</li><li> One more double inversion, when a Sherlock Holmes impersonator is found shot to death. Like the above example, the episode runs as a murder investigation, until the team discovers the gun tied to an elastic in the chimney, revealing that when the victim shot himself and let go of the gun, the elastic snapped it back into the chimney. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then we find out that the <em>real</em> murderer had <em>set the whole thing up to look like a suicide that had been set up to look like a murder</em>, as an appropriately Holmesian mystery. Yes, a murder, made to look like a suicide, made to look like a murder</span>. Which references "The Problem of Thor Bridge".
</li><li> There's yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> the episode "The Happy Place", which opens with a woman in a bikini jumping from her apartment window onto a bus and dying. The subsequent investigation throws <em>The Erotic Mind Control Story Archive</em> a bone by revealing that a hypnotist was behind it all. She got her clients to rob banks and forget about it via post-hypnotic suggestion; the woman's suicide was the result of the trigger phrase "It's time for your honeymoon." When the woman heard this, she began thinking she was in Hawaii and thought she was jumping from her hotel balcony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">into a swimming pool</a>.
</li><li> Another inversion in an episode where a man is found with stab wounds in his chest and back. Everything looks like murder until it's revealed that the man was deep in debt and had a life insurance policy that would pay out to his brother. He actually jammed the knife in-between a door and a frame and ran into it several times, making sure the knife fell.
</li><li> In another odd inversion, an old lady drives her car through the window of a bar. The team either assume she died from something and the car went out of control or she was trying to kill someone inside; turns out she committed suicide so her grandson could use her life insurance policy to go to college (they were too poor to avoid it otherwise). Unfortunately, the company wouldn't pay out for suicides, so her death was meaningless.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI NY</a></em> had one where Stella was adamant it was homicide even though the rest of the team felt the evidence said "suicide." She was proven right, naturally.
</li><li> A wonderful example from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> episode "The Tailor's Dummy": The titular character and several other witnesses see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a> jump from his bedroom window. In the end they discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the victim had gone blind (which was covered up by him and his family as he was a fashion designer) and his daughter had killed him by taking advantage of his pyrophobia and playing a tape which made him think there was a fire and they were waiting to catch him below the window.</span>
<ul><li> Though it was still played straight, however, this one was an interesting example, as the "suicide" in question wasn't actually the reason Creek got involved, and was assumed by everyone, including him, to be a normal suicide, so it seemed to be simply a background event, until further investigation began to cast doubt on it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> also subverted this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In 'The Eyes of Tiresias', a man made his own suicide look like murder to frame the man his wife was sleeping with</span>
<ul><li> It also combined this with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery">Locked Room Mystery</a> in the first episode, where an old man apparently shot himself in the head within a sealed bunker, but would have actually been physically unable to do so due to his crippling arthritis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately played with by the fact that the <em>murderer</em> committed suicide, overdosing before sealing himself within the wall of the bunker after killing the guy for revenge, having previously faked his own death at sea.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Logan's mother</span>. It really was just a suicide. (Probably. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">They never did find the body.</a>)
</li><li> Played straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dean O'Dell</span>, whose murder is an elaborate suicide set-up to eventually implicate his unfaithful wife and her lover.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> episode "Bad Faith." There are signs that a detective's death might be murder, but it turns out that responding cops tampered with the scene so his widow would get benefits. The case is still a can of worms, because he and Logan were both altar boys under the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">Pedophile Priest</a>.
<ul><li> Another episode had a construction mogul killed in a professional hit; it turns out that he had hired the hitman himself, both as a way of escaping his crushing debt, and to frame his cheating wife and her lover for his murder.
<ul><li> A third played it a bit more straight, with a key witness "committing suicide" at her desk before she could testify. However, as soon as the Autopsy was done, evidence of massive head trauma was found, more consistent with the victim's head being slammed into the desk then just falling over.
</li></ul></li><li> Law and Order managed to pull off "Not <em>Assisted</em> Suicide" in the episode "Called Home." A victim <em>was</em> killed with a euthanasia machine invented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">a Kevorkian expy</a>, but it's later discovered that medical charts were switched around and the guy did not, in fact, want to go through with ending his life. He was killed anyway as part of a plot by the doctor and his daughter to get revenge on a TV producer. This episode also involves a spectacular case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspectExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspectExistenceFailure">Suspect Existence Failure</a>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the doctor poisoned himself in order to die <em>on the witness stand</em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em> episode based on this, "Confession", also inverts this, as just like in the original, the cops tried to make the suicide look like a murder. But it's also subverted when the prosecutors manage to press manslaughter charges against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">Pedophile Priest</a> in question, arguing that the man was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> via PTSD that resulted from the sexual abuse he endured.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em>: at least twice (in "Pigeon" and "Bad Habits").
<ul><li> Played with in another episode. Turns out the deaths are suicides, but the... victims? were hired to test an experimental drug that drove them to do it, making the drug company culpable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>
<ul><li> Played straight <em>and</em> subverted in an episode. A number of parents of children who died in a school accident begin committing suicide at a rate far above what would be expected for the situation. Sure enough, there's a serial killer disguising his murders as suicides. Except for one of the deaths, which turns out to have been a real suicide after all.
</li><li> In another episode, a number of high school kids appear to be commiting suicide by hanging with little obvious connection between the victims. It turned out they were actually being tricked over the internet into playing a dangerous game whereby the kids hang themselves near to death and cut the wire at the last minute to obtain a natural "high"- the deaths are those who failed to cut it in time and thus "lost" the game. The mastermind turned out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive father</a> who has Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy; he forced his son to hang himself near to death over the years in order to get attention and pity as the poor dad with the depressive, self-harming son. The idea of making this an internet game came about when he got tired of abusing just his own kid.
</li></ul></li><li> The Japan episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMindsBeyondBorders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMindsBeyondBorders">Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders</a></em> is centered all around these. The team is called in to investigate an uptick in American suicides in Japan, while the local authorities are sure they're legitimate suicides. It turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a man killing the people he holds responsible for his parents' suicides, framing them as suicides more because he feels it's "appropriate" than to fool the authorities.</span>
</li><li> Subverted several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse">Inspector Morse</a></em>. Morse insists on investigating several cases of suicide which are <em>actually</em> suicide. He has become quite knowledgeable on what details to look for.
</li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> episode "A Murderer Among Us". The detectives determine that the victim staged her suicide <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to frame her husband; she had discovered that her husband murdered a number of Jewish men and she had been his unwitting accomplice. She had also recently learned of her own Jewish heritage.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> has an interesting take on this trope. When investigating the death of two women, an agent suggest it might be suicide only to be told that it didn't matter, standard procedure insists that all deaths are to be treated as murders until proven otherwise. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Naturally in this instance, going by procedure pays off</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scandal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scandal">Scandal</a></em>: Played with in "Spies Like Us" when an ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyofFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyofFiction">B613</a> agent shoots himself in a residential neighborhood in broad daylight with several witnesses - to show his death <em>wasn't</em> a hit.

Finally, after Bentham's identity is revealed as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">John Locke</span>, we are shown that he really did intend on killing himself via hanging...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before Ben appeared, talked him out of killing himself, learned valuable information about Jin and Ms. Hawking, and then proceeded to kill Locke by strangulation, making it look like a hanging</span>.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfBriscoCountyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfBriscoCountyJr">The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.</a></em>.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, where Claire discovers her college roommate apparently having committed suicide by jumping out the window, even leaving a note about how depressed she was, despite having planned out her whole life.

The best friend of the man in charge of the operation to help the aliens appeared to have committed suicide after his wife's corpse is used. His friend isn't so sure, since he had been investigating the aliens and thought they were conspiring right before he died. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted however, since there was no conspiracy, and it really was a suicide.</span>
</li><li> An apparent suicide sets the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StateOfPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StateOfPlay">State of Play</a></em> in motion. Proving it was actually murder is just the start.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> everyone assumes that the emotionally unstable marine with discipline issues was murdered. And to be fair, he didn't get along very well with a large number of the crew. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the trope ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> when it turns out he <em>did</em> commit suicide and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Rush</a> framed it so it looked like a murder, to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Colonel Young</a> removed from command, but making sure to make it look <em>enough</em> like a suicide that Young wouldn't be convicted by the impromptu jury.</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a></em> did this with about half its cases. Nearly every next-episode preview featured at least one case in which someone had been found dead, and narrator Robert Stack would always end it with "the police ruled it a suicide, but the family says...murder."
<ul><li> When the segment aired, it would always be highly sympathetic/slanted in favor of the family's claim that the victim had been murdered, and dismissive of the police's theory, even when <em>all</em> the evidence pointed to suicide and the only thing the family had to go on was a vague insistence that "she would never kill herself." Of course, basic logic would dictate that the family is far more likely to let their affection for the deceased cloud their judgment, and anyway, they're not trained professionals at this sort of thing like the police are. But "Unsolved Mysteries" would routinely imply that the police in a given case had no idea what they were doing.
<ul><li> A better name for the show might have been "Mysteries That Have Been Solved but Which Victim's Family is Still in Denial About."
</li></ul></li><li> Although in the interest of fairness, they did profile quite a few cases like this that were so obviously <strong>not</strong> suicide, involving things like multiple types of blood found on the scene and a man being bound hand and foot before being dumped in an incinerator. you wonder who the police were fooling.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRockfordFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRockfordFiles">The Rockford Files</a></em> uses this trope a lot. A common plot is for a relative or friend of someone whose death was deemed suicide by the police to hire Rockford to prove that it was actually a murder. It always is.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">Boston Legal</a></em> subverted this in one episode that started where the girlfriend of Missi Pyle's recurring character was found by police (hanged) in a manner that suggested murder (hands bound behind back, etc.), then it's later revealed that Missi actually found her dead (still hanged, but that was all) of suicide and staged it to look like a break-in murder. She'd altered the scene since most (if not all) insurance policies (one of these which her girlfriend had had) don't pay out on suicides.
</li><li> A fair number of episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> have the boys investigating "suicides". Given that ghosts, demons and other creature can easily enter locked rooms, and often don't leave any evidence, it fairly justified that these are ruled as such by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a>.
<ul><li> One episode had a man whose death was ruled a suicide when he shot himself in the head...4 times.

</li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlight">Moonlight</a></em> has an alleged murdered acquited, when a book writer lobbies that his case is reviewed and inconsistencies are found. It turns out he <em>did</em> shoot his wife and stage it as suicide. Mick knew it all along, as he was the one who warned her <em>not</em> to get a gun, afraid something like this would happen. The worst part for Mick is that the guy knows he's a vampire and is out for revenge, having spent years reading up on his vampire lore.
</li><li> Inverted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em> episode, the protagonists are hired by an old man in a wheelchair and on life support to witness his murder that he plans to stage by hiring a killer in order for his daughter to get life insurance. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">David</a> shows up, the old man is already dead with no killer in sight. Instead, the police are after him as the murderer. In the end, Maddie figures out that the old man was only partially paralized and could walk. He shut off his own life support just before David got there, planning to frame him all along.
</li><li> Subverted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em> episode, "To The Last Will I Grapple With Thee".
