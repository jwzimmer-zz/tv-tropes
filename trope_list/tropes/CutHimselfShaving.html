The work also makes it clear that no one buys it, or at least has serious doubts that the "shaving" victim is telling the truth.
</p><p>For example, when the police question a murder suspect, they may find that he has cuts or scratches on his face, consistent with the type of wounds that the perpetrator would incur in that sort of crime (perhaps because someone with a knife fought back). When asked where he got them, nine times out of ten he will say he Cut Himself Shaving. Likewise, a guy who beat someone up will often say that the victim "fell down some stairs" or "ran into a door" whenever being questioned by the cops. There are also stories of corrupt or excessively violent police themselves using the same sort of line to explain the injuries they inflicted on a suspect during questioning.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A subversion is a character who really did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">walk into a door</a> but everyone assumes they're covering.
</p><p>In anime and manga, this trope is usually just explained by all characters as "I fell," and keeping it unspecific. This leads to wondering by the characters, as by the reader, "Fell on <em>what</em>?"
</p><p>Also frequently employed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> when he must preserve his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> by explaining away wounds sustained in battle. It may also be used by someone attempting to cover-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm">Self-Harm</a> or someone being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">abused</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">at home</a> (in which case "I fell down the stairs" is a common phrase).
</p><p>Another variant, found in military fiction and military science fiction, has two men  often an officer and an NCO  engage in a brawl in a nice, quiet, out-of-the-way spot to settle some point of honor, with the unspoken agreement being that each will cover for the other's injuries (frequently by claiming to have been practicing hand-to-hand combat techniques.) This is because in many of these settings, striking a superior officer, regardless of the reason, is an offense worthy of court-martial and with very heavy penalties.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, the character Uryu Ishida once explains his injuries from a fight with hollows to a classroom by this. To hang a lampshade on this, the class believes he's lying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist">Blue Exorcist</a></em>, Rin uses 'fell down the stairs' as his excuse for bruises he received in a fight. It gets funny when he attempts to explain his nosebleed.
<div class="indent"> Rin: I landed on an insanely hot babe.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>, when Dr. Tenma finds Dieter on the floor screaming in pain, his legal guardian claims that he fell while standing on a chair. This excuse works for all but thirty seconds before Tenma lifts the boy's shirt and discovers that he is <em>covered with scars</em>. It takes less than ten seconds for Tenma to call bullshit on the guardian's "the ambulance is coming, you can leave now" spiel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaReiZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaReiZero">Ga-Rei -Zero-</a></em>: Kagura explains a large cut on her thigh (inflicted by a spirit armed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">her katana</a>) as her "walking through some glass".

</li><li> Parodied in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousOuttakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousOuttakes">Hilarious Outtakes</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em>. In a "child-safe" redub of a gang fight, mooks exclaim things like "Ow, bee sting!" and "cut myself shaving" as they get shot.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> uses the "fell down stairs" excuse to cover for one of the many times his mother attempted to murder him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Change123" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Change123">Change 123</a></em> a student fights with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">kunoichi</a> whose weapon of choice is a bunch of sharpened keys on a wire (sort of a disguised rope dart). These keys leave a serious wound on the student's leg, but in the school infirmary she tells the nurse that she accidentally cut herself with her own keys. The nurse doesn't buy this story (knowing that normal keys don't leave wounds like this), but pretends to accept it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as she is also a kunoichi, from the same clan as the perpetrator, and has recognized her colleague's <em>modus operandi</em></span>.

Yui casually explains it (at first) as a minor injury she sustained upon entering the book. Later, it's revealed that she did that deliberately because she had been attacked and believed she had been raped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots">Medabots</a></em>: Henry used that excuse to justify an injury he got as the Phantom Renegade. It worked despite the injury being on his <em>forehead</em>.
</li><li> Since the day she transferred Umino, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SatouKashiNoDanganWaUchinukenai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SatouKashiNoDanganWaUchinukenai">Satou Kashi no Dangan wa Uchinukenai</a></em>, had been saying she was a mermaid.

In true Umino fashion she states that they're due to the pollution in the sea. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's really due to her dad's beatings</span>
</li><li> Yuuta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShishunkiBitterChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShishunkiBitterChange">Shishunki Bitter Change</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">stuck in the body</a> of his elementary classmate, Yui. One day she slapped him and when Yui's mom asked he said he hit a door.
</li><li> Yuu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SeraphOfTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SeraphOfTheEnd">Seraph of the End</a></em> gets into a fight with the equally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> Kimizuki. When Yoichi asks him why his face is all bruised up Yuu responds that he walked into a telephone pole.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> is quite fond of this:
<ul><li> For example, in the comics, Bruce Wayne was once in the hospital and the doctor notes that for a supposed lazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionairePlayboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionairePlayboy">Millionaire Playboy</a>, he has considerable scarring (which is from his work as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman</a>). Wayne responded with:
<div class="indent"><strong>Wayne:</strong> I fell from a tree. <br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> A tree? <br/><strong>Wayne:</strong> Yes, it was a very tall tree.
</div></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> had him joking that he Cut Himself Shaving to explain a bandage on <em>his arm</em> (it was actually from a weird chemical Joker injected into him that made him start to act like Joker).
</li><li> This was taken to extremes in the '90s comic book arc <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em>. In it, then new villain Bane deduces Batman's identity, breaks into the Batcave, battles Batman and <em>breaks his back</em>. In order to explain why Gotham's wealthiest playboy is now paralyzed, they claim that Bruce Wayne was in a car accident, complete with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Batclan</a> going out and totaling one of Bruce Wayne's vehicles. Now <em>that's</em> dedication.
</li><li> In an odd turn, an <em>actual</em> shaving cut saved Batman on one occasion in the early comics. As Bruce Wayne, he met and briefly romanced a woman who, unbeknownst to him, was one of the Joker's henchwomen. Later, as Batman, he's about to be shot by the Joker, but she recognizes the shaving cut and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">takes the bullet for him.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> toys with this trope in the dialog between Bruce and both Alfred and Lucius — the former suggests he take up polo to explain his bruises, the latter receives a very flimsy handwave for why Bruce had been drugged with a weaponized hallucinogen.
</li><li> In more recent stories, part of Bruce Wayne's public persona includes a fondness for extreme sports. That would plausibly explain some of the scarring.
</li><li> There is also the scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween">The Long Halloween</a></em> where (while Batman) Bruce gets a scratch on his face from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a>. When they meet up later for a date (as Bruce and Selina) and Selina asks how he got the scratch, he tells her exactly this.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush">Batman: Hush</a></em>, Batman is questioning The Riddler, who's currently under custody. When he doesn't like the answer he gets, he punches Riddler so hard he ends up on the floor. The noise prompts a couple of guards to enter the room.

</div></li><li> Early on in his career the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a> Tim Drake ran into some trouble when a councilor at his school didn't buy his excuses for repeated injuries and thought Bruce was abusing him. He eventually convinced her and his father he'd been getting jumped, and since they live in Gotham they accept this as probable. He also frequently uses his skateboarding as an excuse for injuries.
</li></ul></li><li> Marv from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> uses the "cut myself shaving" excuse with his blind mom after the fight at the apartment complex against the dirty cops sent to take him in when he was framed for killing Goldie.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex">Jonah Hex</a></em> the title character sarcastically gives all sorts of unlikely explanations to his massive facial scarring when asked about it, from the traditional "cut myself shaving" to "my toothpick slipped".

<ul><li> In an old, '50s-era strip, Archie has a black eye. Everyone assumes he got into a fight and lost, despite his vociferous protests. Even his mother doesn't understand how someone could walk into a door. He demonstrates ... and blacks his <em>other</em> eye, prompting him to decide not to leave the house for a week, as no one will believe he walked into <em>two</em> doors.
</li><li> Another <em>Archie</em> universe story inverted this trope with Alex Cabot, one of the managers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JosieAndThePussycats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JosieAndThePussycats">Josie and the Pussycats</a></em>. When Alex gets a black eye, he claims that he got it in a fistfight, while everyone else thinks that he walked into a door. Alex continually denies it, but when he gets up to leave he gets nailed in the <em>other</em> eye by a door. The last panel shows a dazed Alex sitting on the floor with two black eyes, mumbling that it was the same door that got him the first time.
</li><li> Yet another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Archie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Archie">Archie</a></em> comic strip had a surprisingly dark example, when you think about it. Archie is <em>forced</em> by his friends to date Betty because they feel bad for her since Archie always snubs her for Veronica. She's in such a flip to get ready that she slams her cheek AND her forehead and bruises them, but just covers it with makeup. Then her and Archie have to jog through the rain which washes off her makeup, and all the guys at the dance assume he <em>roughed her up on the way</em>. It ends with the guys taking Archie out back and beating him up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie">Afterlife with Archie</a></em>, when her boyfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">beats her up</a> one night Betty's older sister, Polly, ends up with bruises. The next morning she tries to cover it with makeup but her family still sees the bruise on her eye. Her excuse was that she walked into the closet door.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a></em>, it's a running gag for Victor Sage to have a snappy response when someone notes he has no face (the desired look of his special mask) such as "Dang those safety razors, you really have to watch them."

Gladstone excuses his black eye by saying he walked into a door, while Donald says he walked into the same door trying to save Gladstone. Daisy is less than convinced.

A stressed Roger gives Francine a black eye, which she tells the neighbors came from running into a door. Later on, she trips over the mop and bruises the <em>other</em> eye on a door for real, explaining it by innocently remarking "It was my fault for leaving the mop out". Naturally, they assume Stan is beating Francine and call the cops on him. None of this is helped by the fact that Stan, under house arrest, is lazing about in a bathrobe and asking questions like "How <em>did</em> you get hurt?"

<ul><li> Italian painter Caravaggio made many enemies in his short and tempestuous life. Once when laid up in bed with slash wounds on his throat and left ear, he told a clerk of the Roman courts that he had wounded himself with his own sword while falling down the stairs, rather than name his attacker(s) and face further retribution.
</li><li> Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman">Richard Feynman</a> - top theoretical physicist, safe cracker and bongo player - loved to frequent nightclubs in the rougher end of town. One night, he had an altercation with a drunk in the toilets at one such club and gained a black eye in the encounter. The next day his colleagues asked how he got it. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">I had a fight in a nightclub washroom</a>," he replied, to which they laughed and said "Oh Feynman, you're such a kidder..." (Apparently he started his first lecture by glaring up one-eyed at the students, and snarling "Any questions...?")
</li><li> People who like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM">BDSM</a> (or just rough sex) run into difficulties with this; it's hard to explain away ("say, these look like whip marks"), and the truth can be very embarrassing. Families and friends can end up conflicted as well. Many professional tops advertise their ability to leave marks or not, as the customer prefers, for just this reason.
</li><li> Supposedly, legendary manager Casey Stengel, when running one of the horrid New York Mets teams from the early 1960s, saw one of his pitchers in spring training with a bandage on his thumb. When he asked the pitcher what happened, the player responded that he had cut himself shaving. Stengel released the player from the team because he couldn't figure out why on earth he'd be shaving his thumb.
</li><li> NFL wide receiver Brandon Marshall, who seriously injured his hand when he slipped on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> bag and put his hand through a glass TV stand while wrestling with his family. Due to his checkered legal history, many commentators were skeptical of this story, but it ultimately turned out to be true.
</li><li> Infielder Clint Barmes broke his collarbone during his rookie year with the Colorado Rockies carrying a package of deer meat (it was a gift from teammate Todd Helton) up the stairs to his apartment. In order to avoid embarrassing Helton, Bames claimed he fell while "carrying groceries".
</li><li> Black Metal musician Varg Vikernes, after he murdered his bandmate Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth, claimed that he stabbed Aarseth in self-defense and Aarseth's TWENTY-THREE stab wounds were from Aarseth falling on broken glass during the struggle. It is more plausible when you know that Aarseth was only wearing underwear at the time.
</li><li> In a subversion/possible straight example, Soccer player David Seaman apparently broke a bone reaching for a remote.
</li><li> Although today best known for the line of hair products bearing his name, hairstylist Vidal Sassoon was, in fact, a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> who fought with a Jewish resistance group called the 43 Group. In post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> London, there were a fairly large number of fascist and anti-Semitic groups who would heckle and harass Jews and vandalize Jewish-owned shops and businesses; the 43 Group fought back, often with violent brawls resulting. One day, after a particularly bad fight, Vidal showed up to work with a badly bruised face. A client said "My God, Vidal, you look terrible! What happened?" Sassoon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">replied</a> "I tripped on a hairpin."
</li><li> American Comedian Louis CK had a bit about how his daughter got a black eye due to walking into a door, and he coincidentally took her out for ice cream afterward. The other people in the ice cream place gave him dirty looks, assuming he abused his daughter. He exclaimed how offended he was that they thought a black eye was all she would have if he had hit her.
</li><li> According to his book <em>Growing Up Brady,</em> Barry Williams sustained a nasty facial cut in a car accident during the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em>. When he reported to the set the next day, the producer slapped a Band-Aid on the cut and decided that Greg Brady had "cut himself shaving." Barry thought, "What does Greg shave with, a lawnmower?"
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>, Carl Edwards once managed to break/damage something (either his leg, arm, or hand) while playing Frisbee. His friends asked him why in the world he'd be honest about the origin of his injury, pointing out he could have claimed he was rock-climbing or, y'know, almost anything other than playing a game that children are able to participate in without receiving a scratch.
</li><li> "Riding a motorcycle in the shower" and "fell off his tennis racquet" have become popular euphemisms in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> racing to explain why a driver has missed a race due to injuries outside of racing, especially so after a mysterious extra-curricular injury sidelined Juan Pablo Montoya a few years ago.
</li><li> Self-harmers often use similar excuses - scratches from their cat or dog seem to be a popular excuse. Because of this, people whose wounds really do come from their pets may be suspected of self-harm.
</li><li> People in the Society for Creative Anachronism engage in sport fights; they wear armor and use sticks rather than metal weapons, but it's quite possible to get bruises and broken bones. So: if you're a female SCA fighter and your doctor asks where you got the marks, do <em>not</em> offhandedly say, "Oh, my husband and I were fighting..." Even sport fencers get this sort of thing <em>all</em> the time. Foil and epeé leave strange little round bruises, saber cuts can look like whip marks, cuts can last for weeks, and sometimes it's possible to draw blood despite the protective equipment.
</li><li> Falling from your bike (either in dirt cycling, mountain biking, BMXing, or even when riding on rough ground in some parts of town) can give weird injuries <em>despite</em> protective equipment, like a stab wound in the thigh from falling over a dead tree branch or bruises on the torso (which look like bruises from a beating) from falling over a rock or stump.
</li><li> Sufferers of CIPA injure themselves in all sorts of ways, especially when they're too young to know better because the disease prevents them from feeling pain. Early on, it leads to false accusations of abuse. Later, shaving is one of the many activities in which they have to take extreme care. Similarly, children with osteogenesis imperfecta have been wrongly believed to be abuse victims due to their frequent broken bones.
<ul><li> Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is another disorder that can cause this. People with this disorder bruise easily and vividly as well as being prone to joint dislocations, which means they can end up with injuries that, without the context of the disorder, would seem suspicious. Exacerbating the issue, Ehlers-Danlos can also cause difficulties with balance and spatial accuity, so the true explanations of their injuries can end up coming off as excuses (so,for instance, a person with Ehlers-Danlos is more likely than the general population to <em>actually</em> walk into a door, and have bruises to show for it).
</li></ul></li><li> Martial artists, due to the very nature of their sport, are quite likely to get injuries during sparring even if they wear protective clothing. Younger martial artists who haven't learned proper control yet are especially likely to walk away from a training session with bruises from their peers, and it can look like they got a serious beating from an abuser.
<ul><li> Some martial arts with focuses on holds and escaping from holds can result in bruises to the wrists or, in some cases, bruises around the throat. These can look rather nasty.
</li><li> This gets even more awkward if a young martial artist is training alongside a parent who accidentally injures them. It can lead to one of those rare situations where saying "Dad punched me in the face last night" is both true and not a reason to call child services.
</li></ul></li><li> Some chronic eye conditions result in the patient's vision being narrowing progressively. They cannot see objects placed even slightly to their left or right. So, yes, they do run into doors all the time.
</li><li> When San Francisco Giants second baseman Jeff Kent broke his wrist during spring training in 2002, he claimed he landed on it badly when he fell off his truck while washing it. It turned out he hurt it performing wheelies and other tricks on his motorcycle (in direct violation of his contract); this probably contributed to his leaving the team at the end of the season even after making it to the World Series. This is a fairly common sort of thing among professional athletes who injure themselves doing something forbidden by their contract (generally skiing or motorcycle riding). Other notable examples include a stab wound to the stomach while opening a DVD case and a cut hand requiring 40 stitches received while cleaning bagpipes.
</li><li> A woman wrote to Dear Prudence citing her coworkers' concern over the bruises that she often had on her arms and legs. They were clearly not believing her vague excuses and thinking that her boyfriend was beating her when in truth, they were engaging in <em>consensual</em> S&amp;M play.
</li><li> In surprising frequency doctors are confronted with a patient, of either gender, who in act of self-pleasuring or some rather kinky consensual sex have managed to jam something in one of their orifices. The excuses for how that particular object got there range, the most common being, "I tripped and fell on it" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">naked for some reason</a>...) to ridiculously elaborate stories worthy of a teen comedy film. In fact, the excuses are often more amusing that the injury itself. The kicker is that whilst a doctor will indeed write the patient's account of events, they will also note what they believe <em>actually</em> happened. The general advice to anyone in that unfortunate situation is basically: Just come clean and promise you'll not do it again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll">They've seen it all before</a>.
</li><li> One of the notorious West German terrorists, the Baader-Meinhoff Group, was found dead in his cell. The official explanation was that a gun had been smuggled in and he had committed suicide. Despite the fact that to do so he would have had to have shot himself in the base of the neck so that the bullet exited through his forehead at an angle virtually impossible for someone to have done to themselves.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSumOfAllFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSumOfAllFears">The Sum of All Fears</a></em>, the imprisoned terrorist was said to have shot himself in the head... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">three times</a>.
<div class="indent"><em>"He had a real death grip on the gun."</em>
