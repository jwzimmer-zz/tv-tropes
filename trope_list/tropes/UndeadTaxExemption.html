</p><p>Most of the time, this trope is dismissed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> and covered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a>.

</p><p>Historically this can be a justified trope. Prior to the twentieth-century, records tended to be sparse, difficult to retrieve, and even more difficult to verify. Without some overriding need justifying such efforts or a dissenting witness, identities and origins had to be taken at face value. If a character has been around for this time passing themself off as a descendant and then 'dying' and inheriting it several times see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGrandsonMyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGrandsonMyself">My Grandson Myself</a>.

</li><li> The Sailor Star Lights become a famous boy band. Even though they came to Earth from a far-off planet and now are under the media spotlight, no one notices a lack of childhood on Earth. Most of the various villains arrive in the form of being shopkeepers, a traveling circus, a famous medium, or exchange students. Even though almost all of these characters are/become highly successful and get a lot of attention under their disguise, no one notices that they came right the flip out of nowhere.

The original series seems to have the least amount, although the girls do seem to wander into town every so often with little comment. The manga has Mihoshi getting a driver's license (partly after using her high-tech blaster right in front of a cop), and Ryoko tries her hand at it too. The TV series has Kiyone and Mihoshi renting an apartment and working part-time jobs often. And no-one really seems to mind all the aliens hanging around. And think about Katsuhito in the TV series (in the OAV he landed long enough ago to have avoided modern recordkeeping).
<ul><li> The third OAV reveals that "Yosho" has ties to the government, possibly going all the way up to the Emperor. In fact, given the relationship between Earth (Japan) and Jurai, it's pretty easy for aliens to establish any long-term identities they like.

After realizing that his success must have changed the future so much he wouldn't belong, he used his training and a 35th century organic computer to create a new identity - which he admits he only needed so he could get a news media job so he could have an easier time keeping tabs on breaking events for his superheroics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blackbird2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blackbird2018">Blackbird</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Paragon abilities are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathActivatedSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathActivatedSuperpower">Death-Activated Superpower</a>.

The LAPD detective investigating the paragons and cabals refers to them as her "zombie files".</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em> we've seen the government's Agency Zero take care of an alien recruit. Though frankly there's enough weirdness it wouldn't be surprising if their government's non-shadowy branches had official forms for aliens, people from lost or hidden civilizations, and dimensional travelers, at least in one of the 'weirdness magnet' areas, of which there are several.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Icon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Icon">Icon</a></em>, as he basically passes his wealth on to his "son", who is himself, over the years. By the time he meets Raquel Ervin, he's Augustus Freeman IV.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, immortal Hob Gadling avoids suspicion by faking his death once in a while and leaving the money to a "relative" with the same name. It still doesn't solve the problem of government records, though, in the modern era.
<ul><li> Averted with the long-lived caveman who dies in a modern city - when his modern-day son (not aware of his father's secret) starts sorting through his father's possessions, he finds paperwork for multiple alternate identities and funds to take advantage of them, with no explanation available for what kind of double life his father may have been leading.
</li><li> In <em>World's End</em> we see that the immortals take care of one another when they encounter others in trouble — Hob helps out an Indian gentleman who was stowing away on the shop Hob secretly owns — so if there's an immortal of some sort working in an influential position, they probably give the others a helping hand in getting proper documents.
</li></ul></li><li> Actually dealt with early on with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow">The Shadow</a></em>. In a tale written by Alfred Bester, the Shadow encountered a caveman who gained immunity to aging from a meteor. This caveman decided to aid the Axis in winning World War II by sabotaging the US war effort. He sought the position of War Labor Chief of the country, but since he did not have a birth certificate, he stole Moe Shrevnitz's birth certificate, bringing him in conflict with the Shadow (the caveman had earlier attempted to buy some business interests from Lamont Cranston, and displayed unusual personal knowledge about Cranston).

<ul><li> Early on the title character used the identity of Walter Dorian until discovered by the police, with the issue "Diabolik, Who Are You?" eventually clarifying he survived a shipwreck as a child and taken in by criminals in the Far East, who never bothered to register him and didn't know where he came from. A later story then showed that Diabolik later found out of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Identical Stranger</a> named Walter Dorian and stole his identity, and thus his properties in Clerville, after assaulting him and throwing him into a river.
</li><li> Diabolik from time to time invents new identities for himself and Eva for use in his heists. It's explained as him being a skilled hacker, able to hack government databases and alter the data well enough to then have the government provide him with actual paperwork. They usually hold well enough under casual scrutiny, but crumble whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Ginko</a> gets involved... Something Diabolik has long learned to plan for.
</li><li> Occasionally, Diabolik creates identities for someone else that he owes a favor to. His standard modus operandi is to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">one of his perfect masks</a>, recover the necessary paperwork and give them money and a warning to hightail from the country, as they have Ginko's attention and there's a good chance he may expose them.
<ul><li> In one peculiar occasion, Diabolik adopted a different modus operandi: he sent the woman who needed a new identity to <em>Ginko</em>, as she was a witness in a Mafia trial and knew Ginko, as a high-ranking police officer, could simply have the government provide her a new identity as part of a witness protection program.
</li></ul></li><li> In "The Years Lost in the Blood" Walter Dorian turns out having survived Diabolik's attempted assassination only to be captured by rogue soldiers preparing for a coop and, being a foreigner, detained as a spy for years until he managed to escape and reach Clerville's consulate... At which point he found out he was legally dead due Diabolik confessing his murder, and with him having no family or heirs his properties had been seized by the government. Given Diabolik's involvement, Dorian's identity was quickly verified, at which point he was granted a temporary pension until the matter of his properties could be settled and a new identity due the very real risk of Diabolik finding out and finishing the job to take over his identity again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His properties remained in the government's hands due him tracking down Diabolik and trying to force him to pay him money for what he did to him and also to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">promise to leave him alone</a> only to accidentally reveal Diabolik had <em>another</em> good reason to kill him, resulting in Diabolik doing just that</span>.

As the Big Uneasy happened only a decade ago, courts are still hashing out how to apply the law to people who come back from the grave... but Dan <em>does</em> have to pay taxes, so doesn't get a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption">Undead Tax Exemption</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, when the first thing Arthur Winkling gets after being turned into a vampire is a derelict crumbling castle needing thousands and thousands spent on it in repair work; the second thing is a final demand for two hundred years worth of back taxes on the castle. He discovers there's no money worth a damn associated with the title of Count Notfaratoe, and because, legally, vampires never die, it <em>is</em> possible to be legally liable for several hundred years worth of debts.
</li><li> Mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The main character</span> "died" but got better. At least a year passed with the world considering him dead. This has, however, happened enough to wizards that the White Council of Wizards has forms to fill out to get "reinstated". (Which makes sense given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">Wizards Live Longer</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: Wizards and muggles generally live in two separate societies, but in the times when the two worlds must interact this trope can come into play. Wizard children born to magical parents are presumably never registered to receive birth certificates given wizards' general ignorance of muggle customs, yet Ron receives a driver's license in Deathly Hallows. Muggle-borns could cause problems as well, given that at the age of eleven they suddenly disappear from the muggle society for ten months out of the year. The Ministry of Magic maintains a staff of "Obliviators", wizards and witches who specialize in memory charms. Usually, their job is to cover up public displays of magic or appearances by magical beings. However, it is quite reasonable to imagine that they also perform the necessary manipulations of muggle authorities to manage children who seemingly drop out of sight. At one point the Ministry even arranges to have the <em>president</em> of a foreign country "forget" to call the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and reschedules for them to do so the following day, thus showing the extent of their reach. It's also possible that getting these kinds of things taken care of is part of the reason the two governments work together at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos">Journey to Chaos</a></em>: Two aversions:

</li><li> Vaya is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> created by a fugitive in hiding. Thus, when Professor Haburt wants to adopt her, he has to make up a cover story about finding her on the street because she was abandoned by her parents due to the country's regular food shortages. There's no Ceihan paperwork to support this but the scenario is plausible enough for Ataidaran paperwork to be created. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Since she's a clone of his real daughter, he also has to change her name as well as her hair and eye color so no one suspects a link between them.</span>

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a></em>, it's shown that their descendants throughout the centuries continue to come up with ways to hide the fact that they're much longer-lived than their fellow humans. The records of their genealogy, however, are fastidiously maintained in the secret Family files.
</li><li> Explored in the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paranormalcy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paranormalcy">Paranormalcy</a></em>, <em>Supernaturally</em>. Lend's father David helps immortal paranormals by giving them fake paperwork so they can function in society.

Jagi Lamplighter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter">Prospero's Daughter</a></em>, averted. Miranda contemplates the difficulty in getting her ID updated nowadays after she slips by one guard only because she has white hair; a century ago, a letter of introduction was enough to establish someone. Later in the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we learn that they are trying to establish identities for lots and lots of people. They finally came to the conclusion that they would have to forge them in sequence. Even with the ability to compel people to issue birth certificates, etc, and the help of an extensive extended family, it's rough.</span>
</li><li> Repeatedly averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack">Repairman Jack</a></em> novels, in which Jack expends considerable thought and effort on establishing false identities, through which to obtain credit cards and other conveniences while remaining off the grid of officialdom. When he <em>does</em> consider becoming a fully-documented citizen, because Gia wants him to legally marry her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> before their baby comes</span>, the logistics of setting up a sufficiently solid identity for himself are so complex, Jack suspects it'll use up nearly all the gold he's been hoarding from his hired-vigilante work - and as the series begins, he's received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndisclosedFunds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndisclosedFunds">Undisclosed Funds</a> for fighting <em>terrorists</em> for the British government, and gets paid that <em>again</em> for the job that jump-starts the plot.
</li><li> One of the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SERRAtedEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SERRAtedEdge">SERRAted Edge</a> novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a> mentions that an elven protagonist carries a magically-created driver's license (copied with alterations from a human friend's license).

Besides, all three protagonists are deliberately living "off the record" to hide from enemies.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSistersGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSistersGrimm">The Sisters Grimm</a></em>. The ever-alfers (all characters from fairy tales) are immortal (age only if they want to, can be killed but need a bit more than a normal human). Even though non-humans (e.g. the Three Little Pigs) can appear human, most are unemployed and hide in Ferryport or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an underground village in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> Central Park</span> because they do not have official papers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">For those slip-ups, there is always memory dust.</a>

This is so that she can attend university, something most of her people don't choose to do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeMachineSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeMachineSeries">The Rings of Saturn</a></em>: Very noticeable in its future setting — at one point, the time traveller protagonist gets in trouble because the address he gives is years out of date. Nevertheless, he's able to enroll into an elite academy later on and become a full-fledged astronaut (though it's implied he had the backing of a politician).

<ul><li> The Cullen family move every few years and are able to assume identities, get jobs and enroll in school. <em>Breaking Dawn</em> reveals that they work with a professional fraudster who can provide them with fake passports, drivers licenses, etc. They've also been doing this for a long time and have also amassed a lot of money and contacts to grease the wheels.
</li><li> This is pointed out in Maryann Johanson's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/blog/2010/06/062910the_twilight_saga_eclipse_revi.html">review of the film<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Maryann:</strong> Hes a century-old immortal, hes richer than God, and hes not even bound by the clichés of vampirism to avoid sunlight: he could be doing anything and everything fabulous with his endless, privileged life. Traveling the world. Living like a rock star. Anything. What does he choose to do? Attend high school in the rural Pacific Northwest.

Older ones are shown to use a complex web of lawyers, front companies and multinational bank accounts to allow them to openly own property and engage in similar affairs. Of course, most supplement their income with assets taken from victims. Armand amasses a huge fortune very quickly by slaughtering drug smugglers in large numbers and then having the cash he takes laundered. The fact that they possess telepathic powers also goes a long way in enabling them to maintain the upper hand in dealings with mortals and modifying any memories as needed. Lestat selects his first attorney based at least partly on the fact that the man's mind is very easy to read.
<ul><li> Quinn Blackwood comes by it honestly, as in life he had inherited control of a generations-old family trust that has contracted accountants to take care of the taxes and capital gains that come from the trust's earnings, and anything he cares to buy comes from the interest. The trust also takes care of the upkeep of his plantation house and the pay for the employees that work at his estate. Tax men don't usually care much who the beneficiary of a trust is, so long as the trust is taking care of its business.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character from <em>The Vampire Tapestry</em>, who got the urge to hibernate for decades every generation or so, was fearful of doing so in modern times, in part because of this trope. (Also because he was worried humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">might not even be around anymore</a> the next time he woke up.)
</li><li> The eponymous character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyGavrielKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyGavrielKay">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ysabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ysabel">Ysabel</a></em> is briefly annoyed when, having been reincarnated in France for the umpteenth time since the Roman Empire, her old stash of francs that she hid the last go-round is now useless. She steals another woman's purse instead.
</li><li> In <em>Beneath a Gated Sky</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertReed">Robert Reed</a>, The Few that travel between dimensions send someone ahead to spend decades building up influence so that they can <em>avoid</em> this in the first place, allowing them to set up false identities relatively painlessly. When a group of Few enters a new realm intent on settling, they are given a crash course in history and customs by one of those scouts, and relevant paperwork is filed and manipulated.

When they admit they lost their originals without ever submitting them to the proper authorities, he hurriedly throws new ones together... with some spite thrown in at having to do it again, such as deciding that Sally was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> woman, much to her chagrin. Subverted in an episode where they get audited and make up several far-out stories to explain why they haven't paid their taxes before. Eventually, they admit to being aliens and the IRS guy looks at them for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a> before saying "Sorry, I've heard that one too."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em>, all the vampires seem to have jobs. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Herrick is a local policeman, and the vampires' lair is an undertaker. This is justified as vampire society has centuries of experience in hiding in plain sight, and it is implied there are vampires in high places. Also, Annie (a ghost) got a job as a barmaid. This isn't completely impossible, as Annie can (usually) pass for a normal human, and if she gets paid cash in hand, there wouldn't be the fact she's legally as well as biologically dead to worry about.
<ul><li> In Season 2, the system starts coming apart after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Herrick's death</span>, and Mitchell has to work to cover up for the rest of the vampires. Especially whenever one of them slips and kills someone.
</li><li> In one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> Books it's revealed that vampires get normal humans to act as body doubles so they can have passport photos.

In real life, people who have mistakenly been declared dead in some government database can spend years trying to get the bureaucracy to acknowledge and correct the error. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Buffy</span> was never declared dead. The Scoobies actively hid her death through the use of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the BuffyBot</span>.
<ul><li> Although she did get a gravestone. A gravestone in a remote area, so no one other than the Scoobies knew it existed.
</li><li> The social worker handling the paperwork for the Buffy household went a little cuckoo bananas nutcakes after being tormented by an invisible woman. Perils of a Sunnydale life.
</li><li> Anya Christina Emmanuella Jenkins (Lame-Ass Made-Up Maiden Name)? She even goes to high school after losing her powers! Although she <em>did</em> alter reality so that she'd appear to be a normal high school student and not a freaky-ass vengeance demon. She didn't account for the possibility that she'd lose her powers and be stuck that way.
</li><li> In the Season 10 comics, Spike states that it would be a challenge for him to get a job, pointing out that he has no social security number, can't work daytime shifts, and has a hundred-year gape in his resume; he explains that most vampires support themselves by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheDead">robbing their kills</a>. Xander suggests he get a job as a consultant for the S.F.P.D.'s supernatural crimes unit, which Spike confesses isn't a bad idea.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>
<ul><li> Spike and Angel himself both having learned to drive (and Angel holding a driving license). Angel successfully rents property in LA — how many estate agents do you know will send someone out after dark to arrange a lease? This is lampshaded in one episode where someone asks Angel how he can order stuff over the Internet. Fred explains how to hack a company's computer system and steal whatever you want. Angel says he just memorized Cordy's credit card number.
</li><li> Fred spent a few years in a Hell dimension. Afterward, she lives in the Hyperion and gets all her resources from Angel and co, so legal documents are not necessary.
</li><li> Kate comments in one episode about how real detectives have licenses and surnames.
</li><li> They don't into the details of how Angel acquired his first place in L.A, but the team consulted a millionaire who owed them a big favor for financial advice when they decided to take over the Hyperion Hotel.
</li><li> The deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> Gavin Park quickly recognizes that they can shut Angel Investigations down simply by pointing out Angel's ID issues to the government. Just to spite Gavin, Lilah gets Angel all the documents he needs.
</li><li> Humorously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in "The Girl in Question", when Spike's rant reveals that the Immortal had him thrown in prison for tax evasion.

As with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em> example, detailed scrutiny quickly reveals them as false.
</li><li> Both versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkShadows">Dark Shadows</a></em> have this problem for the vampire Barnabas Collins. Pretending to be a cousin from England helps him be accepted by the family, and he can sell his old jewels to get money, but that isn't going to get him a Social Security number or credit card or let him open up a bank account. Especially since he'll have needed those to buy a wardrobe and renovate the old house.
<ul><li> Presumably he had Willie Loomis do most of the shopping for him, as well as bring him up to speed on how to blend into the 20th century.
</li></ul></li><li> Throw in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em>: Something is mentioned in early episodes about switching persona on a semi-regular basis, although this never occurs in the series. The series timeframe never got past the point of plausibility for a normal person. Reapers also get new "real" identities with the help of reapers who work in the government.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original series didn't go into as much detail as to how the Third Doctor managed to keep covert in 1970s Britain, but it can be safely assumed that UNIT was more than able to provide him with enough documentation to keep Inland Revenue happy. By the time of the revived series, the Doctor's psychic paper usually manages to serve this purpose for them  and they're no longer stuck on Earth, anyway.
</li><li> The "John Smith" alias was adopted for this very reason. Mind you, there's a later scene where some big shot visiting UNIT complained that the file on Doctor John Smith is completely empty.
</li><li> The new series has had various moments where the various undercover aliens' disguises were imperfect enough for regular human journalists to pick up upon them, such as the Master  for example, because no one at the university he supposedly went to could recall him. Unfortunately, the villainous alien in question will typically make quick work of anyone who finds them out before the protagonists arrive...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> with the Master in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E12TheSoundOfDrums" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E12TheSoundOfDrums">"The Sound of Drums"</a>. He's using mind control to make most people think he's been around for decades. To the 1% of people who are immune to the mind control, his forgery is actually very obvious.
</li><li> In the spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em>, aliens grow a human boy in a lab; Sarah Jane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalComputer">Magical Computer</a> is able to fabricate an identity for him so that Sarah Jane can adopt him.
<ul><li> Though not without problems  when his "Real" parents (actually evil aliens) turned up to claim him, she had real problems trying to explain why she hadn't gone to the authorities when she found him. At least she realized that "But they can't be his real parents  he was constructed by the Bane!" probably wouldn't help her case.
</li><li> Although her UNIT contacts did at least keep her out of prison on a kidnapping charge while things played out.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>, where a young accidental time-traveller is provided with paperwork, gets herself a job and heads off happily to London for her new life.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka">Eureka</a></em> after a women thought to be dead shows up in town due it having been a clone that died, Carter begins going on and on about how hard it'll be to convince all the bureaucracies that declared her dead that she's now alive. Only to find out the town of Eureka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">has a standard Resurrection Form that takes care of everything.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight">Forever Knight</a></em> the vampire-cop considers moving on at one point and visits a vampire whose specialty is providing false identities for this very purpose.
<ul><li> At one point he also has to dummy up birth records when someone starts looking into his past.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed on the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven">Haven</a></em>. Various characters show up that have been helping Haven, Maine hide the suspiciously high numbers of deaths due to the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Troubles</a> throughout the years, including falsifying news stories and death certificates. Duke Crocker goes missing for six months and is presumed dead, and when he returns, he gets arrested and accused of being an imposter for a while. Audrey Parker was missing for even longer than that, but since she is a police officer, her colleagues help her with the documentation.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> TV series deals with this a few times, although the exact treatment seems to vary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, or maybe depending on the plot of an episode. Presumably most or all immortals have to do this in modern society, and do so successfully (perhaps relying on black market sources and fraud/forgery of official documents). Some even manage it despite very public deaths (most notable are a guy who made a circus act out of the fact that he couldn't be killed, and Richie, Duncan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekick</a>, who had become a professional motorcycle racer and died on the track). Mostly, this is treated as little more than a bother and having to leave town for a while, but a few times there have been attempts at justifications, such as Duncan complaining about how hard it is to forge/alter records and documentation for his friend Hugh Fitzcairn, who has not adapted well to new technology like computers.
<ul><li> Another episode played with the trope: when a friend of Duncan's shows up on his doorstep with police right behind her she claims it was because she was in the same hotel as a VIP that was killed and afterward the police had realized that her paperwork didn't check out and have been following her since. The truth is that, haunted by her failure to assassinate Hitler and potentially save many lives, she has taken it upon herself to go around assassinating would-be dictators and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">those who spark off hate crimes</a> so that the world will never go through that again.

In one episode, Jeannie wanted to travel overseas with Major Nelson disguised as a normal woman, not hidden in her bottle. He told her that she'd need a passport and that she could go with him if she could get one without using magic. Of course, he knew there was no way a centuries-old genie could produce the proper documentation.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> zigzags this trope to hell and back, sometimes justifying it, sometimes glossing over it:
<ul><li> Emma Swan has an easy explanation: she is officially found as a baby by the side of the road, so she enters the system as any abandoned baby would. The same can be inferred of Lily.
</li><li> The Dark Curse seems to provide all the needed papers to the Storybrooke residents. It makes sense within the magically isolated bubble that is the town, but apparently, the new identities have a certain reach even on the outside. Regina has all the right credentials to adopt infant Henry from an agency in Boston; Mr. Gold has enough contacts and power to grease the wheels and make the adoption happen, even having a couple dropping off the list at the last moment; Sidney Glass has a wide enough ear network to crack open a classified file from a closed adoption. Did the Dark Curse give them all leverage on the outside world?
</li><li> Ursula and Cruella fall into a portal to the Land Without Magic and manage to get by for three decades afterwards. Ursula seems to work a low-pay job and live in a modest-income flat, so she might have pretended to just be an undocumented immigrant from somewhere. Cruella was married to a rich and corrupt husband, who might have had a hand at integrating her. Neither gets an explanation in-universe.
</li><li> Ingrid the Snow Queen is even more puzzling: a single lady from another dimension gets integrated well enough to own a house, work as a foster parent for orphaned children and file for adoption for one of them. She even does this in-universe when she turns up in Storybrooke, blends into the background and even opens an ice cream parlour without Regina, who has eyes everywhere in town and is aware of the Curse, being the wiser.
</li><li> Baelfire/Neal Cassidy seems to avert this at first, living at the edge of society as a petty thief. Flash-forward ten years, and he seems to own a flat and have a corporate job.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995">The Outer Limits (1995)</a></em>: Averted in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S3E4LastSupper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S3E4LastSupper">Last Supper</a>". Laura/Jade was caught by the FBI when they found multiple false identities she used to conceal herself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlayer">The Player</a></em> had a former Witness Protection officer go into private business creating false identities with the assistance of an insider in a government records facility who entered fake births into the system which would form a basis for the new IDs. The inside man was given away when it was noted how people connected with the forger seemed to have been born in a small rural county which just happened to have the records facility.
</li><li> Played oddly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em>, with travelers from the year 3000. Its explicitly stated that their drivers' licenses are invalid in the present... but getting a new one is a simple matter of taking the test, with no problems of legal existence.
</li><li> Jarod of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender">The Pretender</a></em> presumably has to forge any and all documentation he uses to establish himself in each new identity. Only rarely does this come up in the series — for example, when he's working as a paramedic and a hospital bureaucrat complains that he can't get ahold of Jarod's tax forms.
<ul><li> It is alluded to in the series that his personas are temporary at best and would not stand closer scrutiny. He only has to pass the initial check, find what he is looking for and then leave. He does his research in a very low key position and only then assumes the high profile persona needed to accomplish his mission. Once he 'saves the day' he has to leave really quick before he is stopped or the bad guys find him.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em>, where the protagonists have to go to great lengths to hide the fact that Chuck is alive from just about everybody. She uses an alias in public and doesn't have any valid ID.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele">Remington Steele</a></em>: The eponymous character is actually a made-up persona taken over by a con man. He had no problems the first season, but the second season starts out with a visit from the IRS, curious about the lack of about twenty-odd years of income tax filings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a></em>:
<ul><li> At least half a dozen aliens here and there have been found off-world, presumably brought to earth and integrated into human society, and never seen again. The Witness Protection Program must have a permanent office set up in Colorado Springs, CO, and/or Stargate Command has a permanent liaison with the WPP.

In the end, the clone decides to go back to high school and make his own way. How they get him the necessary documents to do so is not explained. Of course, this is the same organization that can hide Stargate Command, which is an element at least the size of a few battalions. One kid oughta be easy.
</li><li> Ba'al. He ends up on Earth, as a freaking CEO of a huge high-tech company, and no-one seems to know where he came from, or how he got to be in charge. Of course, one must remember that Ba'al has control of the Trust, a shadow organization that has roots in most major government agencies. No doubt they could manage to forge the relevant documents.

At the end of season one, she vanishes after defeating the Demogorgan, and in the next season (which takes place a year later) it's revealed that she was shortly after taken in by Hopper.

The protagonist once had to sit tight in a small county jail cell because they didn't check records with computers.
</li><li> Lampshaded on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> with Sophie-Anne, the Vampire Queen of Louisiana. She amassed immense wealth over the years, using undead tax exemption to her advantage. But now that Vampires have come into the open, the IRS is after her.
<ul><li> Indeed one of the central themes of the series is coming out, being taxed and having rights.
</li></ul></li><li> In the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>, Stefan tries to become a new student and is quizzed on his lack of vaccinations and paperwork. He has to hypnotize the secretary to believe that everything is in order.
</li><li> This is addressed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em>. Neal Caffrey is a conman who regularly uses fake identities. However, he is fully aware that even his best identities cannot survive a thorough investigation. When he considers breaking his parole and fleeing the country, he is referred to a master forger who spent decades creating a set of 'perfect identities'. The man registered a number of fake births with the government and over the years he created fake school, medical and employment records for his 'kids'. He planted those records all over the country in government archives. He made sure that the identities had credit histories and that they all paid their taxes on time. Anyone doing a background check would have to do a very thorough in-person investigation to discover that these people never existed. For obvious reasons, the forger is asking a lot of money for one of these identities.
<ul><li> In general, the series presents fake identities only working until someone starts taking a closer look at you. Once the FBI starts investigating, it does not take them long to spot the tell-tale signs of a fake identity.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> spends a whole day trapped inside a book. Upon being released, she is convinced that it's still the same day and immediately goes on with her life. Even if we assume she's a total idiot and won't eventually notice that it's a day later, there's still the little issue that there would be an AMBER Alert on her by that point.
</li><li> The 2016 miniseries revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> plays this for laughs. When a lizard-man turned human suddenly has the urge to get himself a job, Mulder questions how he managed that without any documentation. The lizard-man claims he just BS'd his way through the whole thing.

<ul><li> While not undead, this issue sometimes comes up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">wolf-born</a> Garou. The game itself doesn't explain what they do if they want to integrate with human society, it's just taken for granted that the other werewolves and their kinfolk (humans born with the gene recessive) forge identities for them, and possibly teach them reading and other basic skills.
<ul><li> Considering the Glass Walkers, it's not hard to figure out how they pull it off...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> also touches on it. Between being able to create Ghouls and (depending on the clan) other mind-control powers, most vampires find little intrinsic problem in arranging things. Source material/fluff occasionally mentions both the necessity of ensuring your own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption">Undead Tax Exemption</a> and the effectiveness as a tactic of screwing with your enemies'.
<ul><li> However, the fluff (Book of Nod specifically) also says "There will always be Caesar, pay him his due". The notes on that specific line imply that tax evasion is one of the biggest threats to the Masquerade.
</li><li> This is part of why the Ventrue are in charge of the Camiarilla; they have all the business and government influence necessary to handle this kind of problem.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> also takes into account that characters will likely look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">a little different</a> due to their time in Faerie if they're not presumed dead. There's a Merit called New Identity that runs from 1 dot (a forged driver's license that <em>might</em> pass inspection when you're pulled over) to 4 dots (a well-constructed identity that would take some deep probing by a federal agency to dismantle).
<ul><li> The stand-alone sourcebook <em>Immortals</em> has a similar Merit, Alternate Identity, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">Blood Bathers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">the Purified</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Body Thieves</a> have no need of the Merit, for obvious reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean</a> who manages to become human. While usually one of the Created can operate 'under the radar', when they become fully human their history is going to be rather interesting. <br/>"So what did you do before this?" <br/>"Oh, I wandered the earth as a monster trying not to fuck up the world too much until I managed to become human, what'd you do?" <br/>"I was in banking too."
<ul><li> Reborn Prometheans usually have no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryGuidedAmnesia">memory</a> of their former existence, which means even <em>they</em> wonder about the gaps in their past, with occasionally tragic results.
</li><li> This has been averted in 2e, however, as the act of completing the Pilgrimage now means that reality rewrites itself so that the Promethean was <em>always</em> human, complete with an appropriate background for their particular Pilgrimage.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">Demon: The Descent</a></em>, when the God-Machine creates angels under mortal guises, it also provides resources, contacts, background, anything the newly-minted angel needs. Frankly, manufacturing new identity whole cloth is child's play for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">an entity of such power.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em>. Angels and demons have to have "Roles" crafted for them to fit into society, get a driver's license, etc. Role creation is an equal mix of metaphysical miracle (a powerful superior convincing the universe that you "belong there") and of having celestials in their own Roles (in the DMV, Social Security Office, etc.) manipulating records to make this possible.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomineSatanisMagnaVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomineSatanisMagnaVeritas">In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas</a></em> completely averts the problem by having angels and demons incarnate into an existing person. Demons incarnate when a person dies with few enough witnesses, while angels incarnate in very pious people who donate their body. Archangels' (and demon princes') Avatars just pop into existence, but they vanish within a few minutes so it's not a problem either.

Baron Hauptmann transfers his mind into a new body every few decades and assumes the victim's identity, then kills his old body (with the victim's mind in it) and produces a will that transfers his property to his "heir".

<ul><li> Aigis seems to blend in with society quite well with just a simple wardrobe change, despite being a robot. Being backed by a considerably powerful organization helps justify this.
</li><li> There's Ryoji, who appears out of nowhere as an exchange student. As <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> and Avatar of Death</span>, questions like where he spends his off-school hours and where his transfer records came from are left unanswered.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> Teddie, who is a being from beyond the TV, also manages to slip into society quite easily (well, at least <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>looks</em> very human underneath that bear layer</span>), despite lacking any ID, and any attempts at scanning his body with X-rays or similar medical equipment automatically fails. The only time this is an issue is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Golden</a></em> where he uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RollerbladeGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RollerbladeGood">roller blades</a> instead of a motorbike most of the other Investigation Team acquires after getting licenses.
</li><li> Marie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Golden</a></em> somehow is even worse than Teddie in logistic department; with her previously living in a place between conscious and unconscious, even less social skill than the previous attendants of the Velvet Room, without identity and memory, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">said memory turns out to be a part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of mankind's desire shaped like a Japanese Goddess tasked to be the garbage bin for the fog her fellow aspects expelled after they were defeated, and disappeared after you kick said Japanese Goddess' ass in final boss fight</span>. Cue a year later, and she becomes a weather forecaster on TV, a quite famous one at that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Probably justified after the final battle, said Goddess and her aspects fused with Marie, and she gained their powers. When you can do things such as <em>change the weather on a cheerful whim</em>, you likely don't need to worry about little things such as establishing a paper identity.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Arcueid the True Ancestor vampire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> is magically-self sufficient enough to not require food (her drinking blood would be bad), shelter, or sleep and just wanders Tokyo all day and all night; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless">since she doesn't rely on society's infrastructure</a>, she doesn't need an official identity. When necessary, she presumably hypnotizes her way into getting a hotel room should she need to recover from damage. She actually has a special ability to psychically absorb cultural knowledge so that she instantly knows the language and general customs of any place or time she wakes up in. (Although there is a funny gap between theory and practice.) She's fairly rich, though, as she has a friend in the Clock Tower who sells her fairy gold for her.
<ul><li> Also averted with Ciel, who blatantly states that she just brainwashes everyone, with a standard 'trust what Ciel says' command, and lets their brains fill things in (in fact, she doesn't have to attend classes! She just hangs around the tea ceremony room; well, except when she attends classes for the fun of it).
</li><li> The Back-Alley Alliance, Satsuki, Sion, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riesbyfe</span>, is another aversion. They're not old enough or powerful enough for the shenanigans Ciel and Arcueid do; and while Sion <em>could</em> hack people's minds for an identity, she doesn't. Sion spends most of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a> game sleeping in an alley, and them being homeless is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>.
</li><li> Averted for most of the surviving Servants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateHollowAtaraxia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateHollowAtaraxia">post-Fifth Holy Grail War</a>. Lancer and Rider make a living through part-time jobs, Archer Projects whatever he needs and spends a fair bit of time in spirit form, Berserker and Assassin are unable to interact in any meaningful way with people, and Saber's decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders">freely indulge in Shirou's hospitality</a>. Gilgamesh and Caster are the only ones who actually bothered to set up a legal identity; the first is so filthy rich he can afford to throw money at any problem (hell, somehow he's a <em>business owner</em>), and Caster's main reason to have records at all was to be able to legally marry Kuzuki.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harkness</span> is an android from the Commonwealth named A3-21 who had his face altered and his memories as A3-21 repressed by Dr. Pinkerton. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's now in charge of Rivet City's security and is on their leadership council.</span> Arguably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> case, what with the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-nuclear apocalypse thing</a> — people are no longer likely to be very concerned with paperwork. Hell, as long as you can shoot something reliably, most places will take you no questions asked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> takes android identity forging even further, with three factions at war with each other over android rights: The Institute see the androids they created as soulless robots whose only purpose is to look and act even more human than actual humans because they're emotionless and capable of computing emotions instead of feeling them, and test this out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">ordering their androids to murder survivors and take their place as robot moles</a>. The Railroad see androids as a new race of humans who have even fewer rights than slaves and seek to give them new human identities (and memories), no matter the cost to everyone else. And of course, the Brotherhood of Steel see identity-stealing androids as the ultimate incarnation of the technological abuse of human rights that their charter was created to fight against - and discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their paragon champion was killed and replaced with a robot years ago</span>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>. When Shepard returns to the Citadel after being reported KIA two years prior, C-Sec records still list them as dead. A brief chat with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Captain Bailey</a> has the latter explain that rectifying this sort of thing would usually require about nine days of running around various Citadel bureaucratic offices but he handily fixes everything with a push of a button (it helps that Shepard is a legendary hero and that the C-Sec DNA scanners have verified that it's truly them).
</li><li> Count Janus Hassildor of Skingrad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em> maintains the illusion that he's a very crowd shy noble who never makes public appearances and rarely meets with visitors in person. It turns out that he's a vampire trying very hard to conceal his identity. If his secret were to get out, he'd likely be hunted down and killed. His longevity is attributed by the populace to the fact that he is (or has at least cultivated a reputation as) a powerful wizard.
<ul><li> Averted in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> high-level wizards in the Mages Guild are aware of his status. Instead of owing money, he trades favors to the Mages Guild in exchange for them concealing his secret. Eventually, the Player Character is let in on the secret by Hassildor himself.</span>

Lampshaded from time to time with her lack of ID for buying alcohol, and Allison suspecting that she's an undocumented immigrant.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile">Misfile</a></em> Ash and Em's new identities are justified by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a>, but how Rumi and Cassiel get enrolled in the local high school is a bit of a mystery, and how Rumi's brother Vash gets employment in the local med center as secretary is similarly unexplained. Possibly justified in Cassiel and Vash's case as they are both still in heaven's good graces but Rumi is on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">semi-permanent suspension</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KevinAndKell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KevinAndKell">Kevin &amp; Kell</a></em>, Catherine and Nigel Aura manage to establish human lives in the human world, but to do so, need to forge some documents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Narbonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Narbonic">Narbonic</a></em>: Apparently the Knipl Award committee does no background checks at all on their grant recipients, because in the <em>same year</em> their three winners were a mutant shapeshifter, a battle android, and a were-gerbil.
<ul><li> Correction, a were<em>human</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WapsiSquare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WapsiSquare">Wapsi Square</a></em>, Bud and Brandi are able to acquire modern birth certificates and social security numbers despite being immortal clay golems who predate most known civilizations. However, it is made believable in that it was done by Jin, who has been playing political manipulator in multiple countries for over a thousand years and probably has more than enough contacts to make someone exist (or cease to exist).
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> with Aylee, who mentions she has problems surviving in society because she doesn't have photo ID.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> is an aversion. The heroes go to great lengths to give Aelita a plausible identity ("Aelita Stones, transfer student from Canada"), Jérémie even creating false ID papers for her. And the cover almost gets blown several times, mostly because of Sissi's snooping.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>, Star Butterfly is a princess from another dimension. Star's parents enroll her into Echo Creek Academy and arrange for her to live with the Diaz family by giving her principal (and presumably anyone else with authority to ask) gold and jewels to look the other way.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Because of the Crystal Gems' status as aliens, Pearl mentions in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E6LastOneOutOfBeachCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E6LastOneOutOfBeachCity">"Last One Out of Beach City"</a> that she can't legally acquire a driver's license and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E8GemHarvest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E8GemHarvest">"Gem Harvest"</a> reveals that Greg and Rose Quartz couldn't get legally married.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em> is about two aliens and a robot who come to Earth to hide out. They quickly manage to buy a house and a car (using counterfeit cash their robot printed), enroll themselves in a high school, and one of them even obtains a driver's license.
</li><li> In the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, Beast Boy spots Terra (or a girl who looks exactly like her) going to high school, despite the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Terra is a criminal, supposed to be petrified, and (as of her origin story in the tie-in comic) an undocumented immigrant.
