</p><p>Some names have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">obvious meanings</a> but often, this is done when it is not the original name for the person, place or object, but rather, a new one given by someone or assumed.
</p><p>Renaming oneself can often signify casting aside an old identity, especially if one wishes to part with a particular aspect of oneself. Other times, they may take on the new name in order to reflect a change in their personality or role in life. Renaming someone or something else often is used to claim ownership or to dictate that person or thing's purpose. In the case of this trope, such a renaming is intentional and generally symbolic, and the characters often state their reasons for the renaming.
</p><p>Changing your name <em>back</em> to the original is also a Meaningful Rename.

Eventually, he earned the title Kenpachi properly by killing the 11th division Kenpachi in a duel and replacing him.
</li><li> Yachiru Kusajishi was also nameless. When Kenpachi named himself, he also gave Yachiru her name.

</li><li> Captain Commander Genryuusai Shigekuni Yamamoto. He was originally known by the name Eijisai Shigekuni Yamamoto because of the shape of a scar on his forehead.

He decides to take his talents to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neo-Hong Kong</span>, and renames himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Asia, and through further training, also takes the name <em>Tohofuhai</em> (Undefeated of the East)</span>.
<ul><li> In the anime proper, Master Asia, upon appearing at the opening ceremonies of the Gundam Fight Finals, declares his intention to win and retain the title of Gundam of Gundams for Neo-Hong Kong, and once he accomplishes that, he will truly be Undefeated of the East, West, North, South, and Central, and will declare himself "Super Asia". The drama CD <em>Gundam Fight: Round 3</em> parodies this, as the movie version of Master Asia declares that he already <em>is</em> Undefeated of the East, West, North, South, and Central, resulting in confusion from the other characters in the movie, and catcalls from the audience, particularly the real Chibodee, much to the real Master Asia's chagrin.

Initially this happened because they were trying to hide that Shogun Iemitsu was dead and the person that posed as him was a woman, but after Iemitsu the Younger reveals herself and women started openly becoming family heads, they took masculine names, to the point that a few generations later, only Shogun Yoshimune questions why this is so. Oftentimes the new name is derived from the reigning shogun's name (such as Yoshimune's name being derived from Shogun Tsunayoshi) with those that will indisputably become the next shogun, whether by birth or adoption taking a name that begins with the character 'Ie-' after the Tokugawa dynasty's founder Ieyasu.
<ul><li> Likewise, men in the Ooku adopt more 'feminine' names upon entering, particularly the concubines that father Tokugawa heirs. This started originally when Iemitsu the Younger renamed the men in order to insult them but as heirs started being born it became traditional.

<ul><li> A staple of superhero comics, where usually the first or second thing a person does after gaining superpowers is to think up a name that either describes or obliquely alludes to those powers ("Spider-Man", "Flash"), their source ("Green Lantern", "Radioactive Man" and "Fallout Boy"), or amounts to a mission statement ("Justice League of America", "Brotherhood of Evil Mutants", "Plunderer"). This is especially noticeable with superheroes who start their careers without a secret identity, such as the Fantastic Four.
</li><li> Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a> adopt code names.

</li><li> Superheroes and supervillains sometimes take a new code-name which can be meaningful, e. g. if it is taken in reaction to a traumatic event, switching allegiances, growing up and standing on one's own feet (e. g. Kid Flash (Wally West) becoming the third Flash, the first Robin becoming Nightwing), gaining new powers etc.

He keeps the name even after discovering that he was never an orphan and that his parents just gave him away, partially on the advice of his boss, who said that if he changed it back people would think he was trying to reclaim the days before U-Go Girl's death.
<ul><li> After the death of U-Go Girl (and a legal battle), the Orphan changed the name of the team to X-Statix. He actually said he doesn't really know what the new name means; it came to him in a dream and it's better than nothing.

Similarly, Redlance's initial name was Redmark and One-Eye used to be called Woodhue.

Sidonie was retitled <em>Sidonia</em>, which sounded better, and Schalulleke was renamed <em>Schanulleke</em>, because a <em>schalul</em> was a Flemish word meaning a <em>onion</em>, but Dutchmen didn't know the word and the word <em>-lul</em> meant <em>penis</em>, so Vandersteen changed one letter in the character's name.

<ul><li> The Amavikka culture on Tatooine includes a ritual performed by slaves who have gained their freedom in which they affirm their identity as a free individual, and may give themselves a new name if the old one has associations they wish to discard with their old life. (Not everybody does choose a new name; in the AU "The Guiding Winds", when Darth Vader does the ritual to mark his freedom from Palpatine, he names himself Anakin Skywalker, returning to the name his mother gave him.)

</li><li> In <em>Heretic Pride</em>, Jedi younglings who come from a famous family are given new names to prevent them from finding out who their birth families were and reforming an attachment.

Even at the end of the story after he leaves for good, she decides to break with the past by continuing to be known as Lola Rose. It's also symbolic of a break from her father, since her original name was a portmanteau of her parents' names (Jay and Nikki.)
</li><li> <em>Cookie</em> has a similar plot involving a girl and her mother fleeing from an abusive father. The heroine, Beauty, is a plain and overweight girl who has struggled to live up to her name; but when she and her mother start a successful cookie-making business, she becomes known as Cookie (also a play on her surname, Cookson) and decides that she is much happier to live under this name.

<ul><li> Another example (in a roundabout way) is the way Werewolves receive their full, four-syllable name: They are given the first syllable at birth.

The third is granted by the Pack Leader at around nine or ten years-old, after a First Kill (successful solo hunt). The fourth is received after a wolf's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsRiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsRiteOfPassage">ritual first mating</a> - traditionally both partners taking the other's first syllable as their last. It is apparently traditionally the first for both parties. A werewolf isn't considered a full adult Pack member until gaining the fourth syllable.

</li><li> Aragorn's rename that was initiated to hide his identity from the Enemy, 'Estel' ('high hope' in Sindarin), is especially meaningful as he was foreseen, given the fact that Sauron was coming back and the Elves were leaving, to either be the last man of his line or the one to restore it to its former glory. The foresight came at the first from his grandmother Ivorwen, who also saw him wearing a green stone that would be the source of his other Meaningful Rename - Elessar Telcontar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">Elfstone Strider</a>).

Similarly, Sauron's name before he went evil was (probably) Mairon. ("Sauron" is Elvish for "the Abhorred".)
</li><li> Many of Tolkien's bad guys are renamed, or otherwise lose their names. Sméagol becomes "Gollum". Gríma becomes "Wormtongue". The Nazgûl are nameless, at least in the core books. Sauron's ambassador has forgotten his own name, and just calls himself "the Mouth of Sauron". Even Saruman ends up as just "Sharkey" (which Tolkien conjectures is from the Orcish <em>Sharkû</em>, "Old Man").
</li><li> Several hobbits have been mentioned in the backstory who have adopted a new family name, apparently as a result of becoming leaders or patriarchs. For example, Gorhendad Oldbuck, who led the colonization of Buckland, renamed himself to Brandybuck, and his descendants like Merry use that family name. Samwise Gamgee, likewise, becomes Samwise Gardner by the end of the timeline, which seems to be the result of his work to reforest the Shire, his becoming the master of Bag End, and being the mayor of the Shire for many decades and a known friend of the King.

The clan leader can also rename elders to fit with any battle scars they might have earned, etc... E.g., a cat who lost an eye becomes One-eye. A leader can also change a young cats name, the only known instances being because of deformities (i.e. Deadfoot, Lostface and Crookedjaw).
</li><li> The protagonist of the first several books starts off as a pet cat named "Rusty". When he joins Thunderclan he is renamed to "Firepaw", due to his red pelt color. Eventually that too is changed to "Fireheart" and then "Firestar".

Later he goes by Ordeith (Wormwood) and Jeraal Mordeth, but still mostly thinks of himself as Padan Fain in his own POV.

<ul><li> Happens a LOT in the various incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, due to upgrades, new altmodes, new continuities...
<ul><li> Probably the most famous is Hot Rod becoming Rodimus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Prime</a> in the movie upon opening the Matrix of Leadership.
</li><li> Megatron becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedMentalIllness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedMentalIllness">Galvatron.</a> In the first instance (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em>) it's up for debate as to whether he's even the same person as Megatron.
</li><li> In that vein, many recolored versions of the same toy are marketed as upgraded versions even if they never appeared in the show, occasionally with five sentence backstories explaining why they're a different color.
</li><li> The original cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> was implied to have taken their known names around the time they got stranded on the planet.

(Or, alternately, Megatron takes his from Cybertronian scripture, suggesting the G1 Decepticon did the same.)
<ul><li> Rampage was known as "Protoform X" until he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">Made a Slave</a> by Megatron, who renamed him. He would later admit that the new name suited him.
</li></ul></li><li> Orion Pax becoming Optimus Prime, though he generally has this change made for him, rather than being the one who decides to make it.
<ul><li> The Aligned continuity puts a spin on this, in which it's revealed in the <em>Covenant of Primus</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Optimus Prime is the real name of "Thirteen," the last of the thirteen original Primes created by Primus. After the Fall of the Primes, he willingly entered the Well of Allsparks so that he may be reborn as an ordinary Cybertronian in order to better understand the needs of the next generation. It then reveals that he was reincarnated into Orion Pax. When the humble data clerk Orion Pax accepted the Matrix of Leadership, he regained his memories as one of the thirteen original Primes, and retook his name as Optimus Prime.</span>

Or, at least, that's what he says at first. A later episode shows the real reason: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was the name he chose when he was reborn as an immortal as his way of memorializing the woman he loved, who he always skipped with.</span>

She transforms into her monstrous wolf form and runs off into the forest in a rampage.

<ul><li> In some societies (the Cherokee, for instance), a person is given a name when he is born, then receives a new name upon being recognized as an adult. Often the new name reflects some aspect of their personality or social role. In pre-modern/non-Western societies with very high infant and child mortality, this custom may have originated because many babies would not live to become functioning members of society.
</li><li> In ancient China, men adopted style names upon reaching adulthood, and emperors were referred to by their ruling era, with a new name granted posthumously. Indeed, it was socially taboo to for somebody to call somebody else of the same generation by their birth-name.
</li><li> In pre-Meiji Japan, it was common to give a baby a short, easy-to-remember, and auspicious name that would be used throughout childhood and then to create a full-length adult name when the person came of age. Childhood names were customarily written with a single kanji while adult names used two or more. It was common for an older family member or a social superior to honor the person coming of age by "gifting" them a kanji from their own adult name to incorporate. A person might be renamed more than once in their lifetime, in honor of major events like inheriting a title or taking Buddhist monastic vows. The custom began among the nobility and the warrior classes (the first to adopt true surnames in place of patronymics or epithets) and eventually spread to the merchant and peasant classes as well.
</li><li> During the Japanese colonial periods in Taiwan and Korea, Taiwanese and Koreans were 'advised' to change their names from the original Chinese and Korean style to Japanese, which many proceeded to do, in part to avoid potential discrimination against those with native names.
</li><li> People who convert to a new religion sometimes change names to reflect their new faith. This seems to be particularly prevalent with Western converts to Islam. Famous examples include boxing legend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> (formerly Cassius Clay), American football player/sportscaster Ahmad Rashad (Robert Moore), basketball players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KareemAbdulJabbar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KareemAbdulJabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> (Lew Alcindor) and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (Chris Jackson), singer/songwriter Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens), or, in an earlier century, General Abdallah Menou (Jacques Menou de Boussay). Islam does not require this and the choice is supposed to be voluntary (although some were duped or misled into believing otherwise): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> has been a Muslim since 1998, but did not change his name.
<ul><li> However, it <em>was</em> standard practice in the Nation of Islam sect: adherents would first change their surname to "X" (rejecting their birth surnames derived from old slavemasters), then later would adopt entirely new Arabic names. Muhammad Ali (who was briefly known as Cassius X) is one such example. Others include civil rights activist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a> (born Malcolm Little; later named Malik El-Shabazz after converting to orthodox Sunni Islam), and the sect's current leader Louis Farrakhan (formerly Louis Wolcott, then Louis X). Although Ali and El-Shabazz both left the Nation of Islam they kept their new names.
</li></ul></li><li> Jewish converts to other religions: 19th-century German theologian Johann August Wilhelm Neander (Greek for "new man") used to be David Mendel before he was baptized. German poet <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeinrichHeine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeinrichHeine">Heinrich Heine</a> used to be Harry Heine before he converted to Christianity.
<ul><li> It is a tradition of Jewish converts to retain the <em>meaning</em> of their name, but translate it to other language. <em>Baruch</em> Spinoza became <em>Benedictus</em> Spinoza after baptizment. Both names mean "blessed" - Baruch in Hebrew and Benedictus in Latin.
</li></ul></li><li> It's customary for Jewish children to get a ceremonial Hebrew name at birth, in addition to their common name. Thus, people who convert to Judaism as adults must give themselves a Hebrew name, though it's not so much Meaningful Rename as Meaningful Additional Name, or perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName">True Rename.</a>
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subud">Subud<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a "spiritual movement" that started in Indonesia in the 1920s and gained a following in America in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, advises its members to change their first names if they feel it doesn't reflect their inner self. This was really just a carryover from Indonesian culture, where people will sometimes change their name following an illness or misfortune, to signify a new beginning. Notable Subud members who did this were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">Byrds</a> leader Roger McGuinn (formerly Jim McGuinn), comedian/writer/singer/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">voice actor</a> Lorenzo Music (originally Jerry Music) and actor/musician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HamiltonCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HamiltonCamp">Hamilton Camp</a> (previously Bob Camp).
</li></ul></li><li> Western and Central European princesses who married into the House of Romanov had to become members of the Russian Orthodox Church and that usually entailed changing their name, partly because of the limited number of given names officially recognized by the Orthodox Church. However, princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst did not choose the existing Russian form of her name (Sofya) when she married the heir to the Russian throne, but instead became Katherine (Yekaterina), later Empress Catherine II (the Great).
</li><li> French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, Prince of Ponte Corvo, was elected heir to the throne by the Swedish Estates. He had to join the established Lutheran church, and in the process changed his name to the more Swedish Karl Johan, later king Karl (Charles) XIV. "Johan" is Swedish variant of French "Jean".
</li><li> Then again, there are stage names, more specifically explained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames">here</a>.
</li><li> Popes take a new name upon being elected pope. This custom started with Pope John II in 533, who, prior to becoming pope, was named Mercurius. He felt it inappropriate for a Pope to be named after a Roman god. Catholic nuns frequently take a new name upon taking their final vows. Less significantly for the purposes of this trope, Catholic teens take a saint's name upon receiving the sacrament of Confirmation, although these days their Confirmation name may often in fact be the same as their birth name (if they happened to be named after a saint); even if it is not, they tend to continue to be addressed by their birth name in practice, so this last one isn't nearly as good an example of this trope.
<ul><li> The Confirmation name's generally used as a middle name, although occasionally (for stylistic badassitude) people prefer it to their given middle names. Definitely fits the "symbolic of some character trait" part of the trope, though, as people often pick the patron saint of some important aspect of themself.
<ul><li> One case from history was Vaclav, the son of King John the Blind of Bohemia, who grew up at the French court and at his Confirmation took the name Charles. He became the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV.
</li></ul></li><li> Many Christians, especially Catholics, in cultures where Christianity is uncommon take a baptismal name different from their birth names. This is often the name they use within their religious community.
</li><li> Orthodox monks and nuns take new names as well (by extension, this applies to Orthodox bishops and partiarchs, since all of them are monks). The current Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus' (full title) is Kirill I. His secular name is Vladimir Mikhailovich Gundyayev. Although Kirill is a common Russian name, many monks and nuns are given obscure or archaic names.
<ul><li> This can also apply to Catholic nuns, some of whom can be named after male saints. Often when a nun chooses a male saint she adds "Mary" to the beginning to make it more feminine. Examples include Sister Mary Luke, Sister Mary Finbar, and Sister Mary Richard.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p></li><li> Other real-life examples for monarchs (as well as more fictional examples) can be found in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_name">Regnal Name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> article on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>.
</li><li> In European nobility the title(s) held within a certain family can take precedence over the family name, including when the holder(s) sign papers etc. This works to such an extent that sometimes the original name is widely forgotten (for instance, outside of Britain not too many people recall that the Duke of Marlborough's family name is Churchill). The change from one name to another can indicate an individual's position within the family hierarchy. To use a fictional example to illustrate this real-world phenomenon, in P. G. Wodehouse's Blandings novels, there is the Threepwood family headed by Clarence, Ninth Early of Emsworth, who is colloquially referred to as Lord Emsworth and would sign letters "Emsworth". His elder son, his prospective heir, is Lord Bosham, holder of a minor Threepwood title that presumably was born by his father while the Eight Earl of Emsworth was still alive.
<ul><li> A real world example from France: In the house of Bourbon-Condé, a side-branch of the royal house of France, the head of the family was the Prince of Condé (referred to as simply "Monsieur le Prince" at the royal court) and his prospective heir was the Duke of Enghien.
</li><li> Also the Cavendish family of Englandthe head of the family is the Duke of Devonshire, and his eldest son is (traditionally) the Marquis of Hartington (though for some reason he may also style himself 'Lord Cavendish'.)
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> became Emperor, he made his brothers and his brother-in-law Joachim Murat take Napoleon as a second name when he made them monarchs of other countries, clearly a reminder of just who put them on their thrones. When he also started to award titles of Duke and Prince to various marshals, generals and ministers, he also was very punctilious to use these new titles instead of the family names. It was very noticeable that except in cases where it could not be avoided (e. g. Marshal Kellerman, Duke of Valmy, who was too old to have served under Napoleon) he generally gave the generals titles referring to battles in which they had served under his command rather than independently. Thus Marshal Masséna was made Duke of Rivoli and later Prince of Essling rather than e. g. Duke of Zurich (a very important battle Masséna won in 1799 before Napoleon's coup d'état).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> was born as "Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili", later russified the name to "Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili", took the secret name "Koba" during the Bolshevik Revolution, and then changed to "Stalin" ("Man of Steel") to symbolize his power, his distancing himself from his Georgian heritage, and his new Soviet identity. The notable part is that, apparently, "Stalin" is grammatically incorrect since noun formation doesn't work like that in Russian—but would <em>you</em> say so to Stalin? (He'd probably say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">"Well, now it does!"</a>)
<ul><li> Lots of Bolsheviks did this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Lenin</a> was born Ulyanov, though it doesn't appear to be a symbolic change. Lev Bronstein changed his name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonTrotsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonTrotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> (conveniently hiding his Jewish identity) when escaping from Siberia for the first time. Lenin had many pen names to escape censorship and persecution pre-Revolution. He just chose one of the most popular as a 'main name'. However, the more popular explanation of the name "Lenin" is that it referred to the Lena, a river in Siberia, meaning "my views landed me in Siberia" (he was banished there from 1897 to 1900, and in 1900 he took the name Lenin.
</li></ul></li><li> Many revolutionaries for various causes took on various meaningful pseudonyms. Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky and other Bolsheviks fall into the category. Ditto with Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh (meaning "he who brings the light", who used 2 or 3 other meaningful names, including Nguyen Ai Quoc, or Nguyen the Patriot), China's Sun Yat-sen, Yugoslavia's Tito, formerly Josip Broz, various Palestinian leaders<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ooin');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ooin" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ooin');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">many of whom liked using the <em>kunya</em>, or Arab inverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Patronymic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Patronymic">Patronymic</a>, i.e. calling yourself "Abu [name of eldest son]" (where "Abu" means "father of"). Often the son was fake, adding an extra level of confusion (e.g. Yasser Arafat went by "Abu Ammar", but had no son by that name); other times, the name was real.</span>, various Zionist leaders, etc. This is in part because of their desire to show off their revolutionary zeal and ideology and also to evade police pursuits by obscuring their "real" identity.
</li><li> Some people who changed their identity to escape from Nazi persecution and/or fight in the Resistance retained their new names afterwards. Examples include French general Jacques-Philippe Leclerc, born Philippe Francois Marie, comte de Hauteclocque, and (West) German federal chancellor Willy Brandt, born Herbert Frahm.
<ul><li> Another example: Marcel Dassault, the French aircraft designer, born Marcel Bloch. Dassault ("Assault") was his <em>nom de guerre</em> as a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResistance">The Resistance</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. He kept the name after the war.
<ul><li> His brother, General Darius Paul Bloch had <em>nom de guerre</em> "Chardasso" (<em>char d'assault</em> = <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">tank</a> in French). He too assumed the surname "Dassault" after WWII.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In a somewhat humorous example, NFL player Chad Johnson changed his name to Chad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish">Ochocinco</a> in the mistaken belief it was the Spanish word for his jersey number, eighty-five. In fact it translates as eightfive. Ochenta y cinco is eighty-five in Spanish.
<ul><li> He also claims to want to change his name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese">"Hachi-go"</a> (which is also eight-five, not eighty-five — that'd be hachi-juu-go) to appeal to Asians, who'll probably wonder why he kind-of named himself after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hachiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hachiko">an iconic Japanese dog.</a>
</li><li> Though it should be noted that American football players frequently refer to each other as "one-four" and "three-nine" instead of fourteen and thirty-nine. So he might actually have intended to be called Ochocinco and not Ochenta y cinco. And a few years later, he changed his name back to Chad Johnson (though keeping "Ochocinco" as a middle name).
</li></ul></li><li> Honduran player Carlos Pavón Plummer changed the order of his last names when he finally decided he would recognize his father at age 36. I wonder how commentators will feel of calling him by a different last name now that he is more or less ending his career (though he could further cement his legend status by scoring in the World Cup).
</li><li> Numerous heavy metal musicians have adopted pseudonyms under which they they perform and record, many of whom are not broadly known by their birth names in the metal scene. Usually bandmates will pick similar sounding names, though from time to time one member might leave to be replaced by some who isn't interested in stage names, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> subverts the trope with Nathan Explosion and William Murderface. They sound like mockery of metal musicians' names... except these are in fact their real names (William's grandparents are Stella and Thunderbolt Murderface, while Nathan's parents are Oscar and Rose Explosion).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a>: Soon after Farrokh ("Freddie") Bulsara co-founded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> together with the remaining members of the band Smile, he changed his surname to Mercury. It seems he just liked the sound of the name, but it <em>is</em> connected to the adjective <em>mercurial</em>, which is fittingly defined by Wiktionary as (among other things) "Having a volatile or lively character; quick-witted, changeable, animated."
</li><li> Christopher McCandless renamed himself Alexander Supertramp after he graduated from college, gave away all his money and decided to wander the country, as documented in the book and film <em>Into the Wild</em>.
</li><li> Several cities have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSelectNewCityName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSelectNewCityName">more than one name reflecting each time they have been conquered</a>. Sometimes it might be advisable to be careful which name you use, as that reflects who the "legitimate" owner is and the locals might be touchy.
<ul><li> Although this frequently simply involves names in different languages which actually existed before the city changed hands. Other meaningful renamings of cities and villages may reflect political changes within one country, e. g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs">Sankt-Peterburg</a> was renamed Petrograd during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> to become less "German" and more "Russian", then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Leningrad</a> to honour the father of the Soviet Union, and then after the fall of communism it became Sankt-Peterburg again. Or they reflect famous persons or events from the place's history, for instance after the so-called battle of Hastings, the place where it actually had happened (Senlac) became Battle, after the battle of Minden (1759) the nearby village of Tonhausen ("clay-houses") was renamed Totenhausen ("dead men's houses"), and Eschenbach, home of the medieval poet Wolfram of Eschenbach, is now called Wolframs Eschenbach.
</li><li> A well-known American example is the city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York</a>, formerly Nieuw Amsterdam.
</li><li> Another example is the Northern Irish city formerly known as Londonderry. It was originally called Derry (Gaelic: Doire), but was officially renamed during the 17th century, although until the 1960s both names were generally used interchangeably. Since then Unionists (Protestants) typically prefer to call it by its original name, and that name is still used on most maps. Nationalists (Catholics) disapprove of the use of the word 'London' in the name, and insist on calling it 'Derry'. Because of the still politically charged nature of the area, and lingering memories of the troubles, one must be careful of what name is used. Local radio announcers have resolved the issue by calling the city London/Derry, pronounced "London-Stroke-Derry", or "Stroke City".
</li><li> Famously, the city of Byzantium was renamed to "Nova Roma" (New Rome), but was widely known as Contantinopolis (Modern, Constantinople, the City of Constantine). Currently, it is known as "Istanbul", which is an Arabic form of the Greek word for "The City". However, for centuries, it was still known by all of its older names, even in official texts.
</li></ul></li><li> During the French Revolution a number of place-names were changed because they included references to royalty or specific kings, running from streets and places (e. g. the Place de la Concorde, formerly Place Louis XV in Paris) to cities and islands (e. g. Réunion, formerly the Isle de Bourbon). Many of thes renamings survive to this day. During the Reign of Terror, there were also renamings of cities etc. that rebelled against the revolutions once these rebellions were suppressed. Thus Lyon became <em>Commune affranchie</em> ("liberated community"), Toulon <em>Port-de-la-Montagne</em> ("port of the mountain", a reference to the radical <em>Montagnards</em> in the national convention), Marseilles <em>Ville-sans-nom</em> ("city without a name") and the dapartment of the Vendée <em>Vengée</em> ("avenged") for a time.
<ul><li> Likewise, during the same era, many noblemen who supported the Revolution — or at least wanted to pretend they did — dropped the aristocratic-sounding "de" from their name or fused it with the rest, and abandoned their seigneurial names in a similar fashion: examples include Louis-Nicolas Davout (formerly d'Avout), Louis-Antoine Desaix (des Aix de Veygoux) and Etienne Bordesoulle (Etienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle). For most of them, the change stuck even after the Restoration.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> hundreds of towns and villages, especially in East Prussia and Silesia, were renamed because their names were too obviously Slavic or Lithuanian in origin. In the case of northern East Prussia, which became part of the Russian Federation after World War II, all towns and villages then got all-new Russian names rather than reverting to the old Lithuanian and West Slavic names, partly to set off the Kaliningrad from neighboring Lithuania (then the Lithuanian SSR).
<ul><li> Lithuanian capital Vilnius went through several phases of this. While the historical capital of Lithuania, it was, by the beginning of the 20th century, a mostly Polish-speaking city with largely Jewish population surrounded by mostly Belarusian countryside. It was also known by several different names among various ethnicities. It officially became Vilnius, the Lithuanian version, once the Lithuanians took it over when Poland was defeated in 1939 by the Germans and the Soviets. In a peculiar concession to Lithuanian national sentiment, Soviets officially kept the name Vilnius even in Russian references after annexing Lithuania later that year, rather than Vilna as it was previously known to the Russians.
</li></ul></li><li> Renamings of streets etc. are one of the most common forms of meaningful renames, reflecting changing attitudes to historical figures and events. East Germany went through two big waves of this, first under the Nazis, then under Soviet occupation and during the GDR.
<ul><li> World War II-era renamings in Russia (and Russian controlled territories) became the basis of the following joke: A Russian Guide in Moscow says to a visiting British military officer in 1942: "This is Eden Hotel, formerly Ribbentrop Hotel", "We are on the Churchill street, formerly Hitler street", "The Beaverbrook railway station, formerly Goering railway station." The British officer: "Thank you comrade, formerly bastard!"
</li><li> A recent example from West Germany: In 2012 a referendum was held in Münster in Westphalia to rename the <em>Hindenburgplatz</em> in front of the university building (and former episcopal palace) to its pre-World War 1 name <em>Schlossplatz</em> ("palace square") in view of Hindenburg's crucial role in helping Hitler to power.
</li><li> In the 1970s Glasgow City Council renamed a street 'Nelson Mandela Square' in honour of the ANC leader, then still in prison. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">It just happened to be the street where the South African Consulate is located...</a>
</li><li> Remarkably averted in the case of a 1950s housing estate in Colchester, with its main thoroughfares named for the leaders of the Allied powers. Efforts to rename Stalin Road <a class="urllink" href="http://www.essexcountystandard.co.uk/search/4216206.Colchester__Stalin_should_stay_/">have been steadfastly resisted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Many early Zionists replaced their names with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebraization_of_surnames">Hebrew names<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to erase remnants of their life in exile and to show their commitment to a new Jewish nation. This turned into an official policy during the administration of Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion (originally Grün), when all state officials were ordered to Hebraize their surnames.
</li><li> Many immigrants to the United States <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaturalizedName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaturalizedName">changed their names</a> either to blend in better in their new surrounding or to avoid majority prejudices against their particular ethnic group (or out of exasperation with Anglophones trying to pronounce it properly). There is a myth that many immigrants were assigned new, usually British-sounding names by immigration officials at Ellis Island, but this is untrue; at most, some of them might have inadvertently anglicised the spelling or pronunciation and the new arrivals decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat">just go with it</a> for simplicity's sake.
</li><li> Slaveholders would often give a newly acquired slave a new name, which could involve the given name and the family name (often the slave-owner's own).
</li><li> A lot of people are called by the name their parents gave them as kids, but as they get older, they'll start going by their middle name or a nickname for any number of reasons.
</li><li> The House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, being a very German name, was not that popular an appellation in Britain during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. It became even less popular when the German air force started bombing raids against London using their Gotha bomber. As a result, in 1917 they changed their name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">The House of Windsor</a>, of whom you have probably heard.
<ul><li> This was reportedly in response to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a>' complaint about Britain's "alien and uninspiring" court. George V is said to have said, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ITakeOffenseToThatLastOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ITakeOffenseToThatLastOne">I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien</a>!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> took a more cynical view of this in the 1919 preface to his play <em>Heartbreak House</em>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "Tearing the Garter from the Kaiser's leg, striking the German dukes from the roll of our peerage, changing the King's illustrious and historically appropriate surname for that of a traditionless locality, was not a very dignified business; but the erasure of German names from the British rolls of science and learning was a confession that in England the little respect paid to science and learning is only an affectation which hides a savage contempt for both."
</div><ul><li> Speaking of the royal family, it will eventually become the house of Mountbatten-Windsor; the Mountbatten name is also the result of a similar Meaningful Rename, when Lord Battenberg caved in to British Germanophobia during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> (funnily enough, they did not rename Battenberg Cake in Britain). On the other hand, the royal house of Belgium, another branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha with grievances against German, did not change its name and continues to use it to this day.
<ul><li> They <em>did</em> technically change the name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Belgium, it is used in official documents and identity cards, though it is still called its original name by everyone.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the 20th century, members of ethnic minorities in various European countries either chose to adopt a name more in keeping with that of the majority ethnicity or were compelled to do so. With frontiers moving on a few occasions, this could happen more than once to the same family.
<ul><li> The phenomenon is somewhat older. For instance, when Corsica's bid for independence was defeated and the island indisputably became part of the Kingdom of France, the small nobleman Carlo Buonaparte frenchified his name to Charles Bonaparte and his sons Giuseppe, Napoleone and Luciano officially became Joseph, Napoléon and Lucien (even though they continued to use the Italian forms at home for years). This move was looked upon as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">sell-out</a> by Corsican nationalists, while in later years some of Napoléon's enemies would treat it as foul imposture by someone who wasn't really French at all and therefor pointedly referred to him as <em>Buonaparte</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted by town of Wolfsburg, Germany. The town hosts the gigantic factories of Volkswagen AG, and was originally founded by the Nazi Party, and named simply <em>Stadt des KdF-Wagens</em> (Town of KdF Cars). The British occupation changed the name in 1945 as Wolfsburg after a nearby castle to de-Nazify the town. In this case a meaningful name was changed into something non-meaningful.
</li><li> A district of India held a renaming ceremony for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-10-22/India-women-names/50869628/1">285 girls named Unwanted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ("Nakusa" or "Nakushi" in Hindi) in an effort to fight gender discrimination caused by religious restrictions and the expense of marrying off a daughter.
</li><li> Almost without exception, this is the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Transgender</a> people. In a few cases, the new name is a feminized or masculinized version of the old name, if the person wish to never forget their struggle with their gender identity— making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a> in addition to Meaningful Rename.
</li><li> In the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, especially in Germany, it was quite fashionable for people to show off their erudition by changing their names to a Latin or Greek name that was either a direct or loose translation of their original name (e. g. <em>Neander</em> (Greek: new man) for <em>Neumann</em>, <em>Agricola</em> (Latin: peasant, famer) for <em>Bauer</em>) or something with a similar sound. Thus Jean Cauvin became Johannes Calvin(us), and one of Martin Luther's closest collaborators interpreted his name <em>Schwarzert</em> as <em>Schwarz-Erd</em> ("black earth") before translating it into Greek as <em>Melanchthon</em>. Martin Luther himself looked at this with some amusement and said that if he ever did this himself, he would call himself <em>Eleutherius</em>, a name that sounds like an elaboration of <em>Luther</em> and is based on Greek <em>eleutheria</em> ("freedom").
<ul><li> The man now known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> is listed in the original baptismal record as Joannes Christophus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart; since this document was written in Latin, it is not clear if 'Theophilus' means that his third name was actually 'Gottlieb' (which means the same thing) or 'Theophil'. When he first travelled to Italy, he discovered the Italian form of the name, 'Amadeo', and started using that, although he soon preferred using the French form 'Amadé'. He never did use Amadeus, though, and people who knew him well enough apparently just called him Wolfgang (or derivations thereof).
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion">writer Gary Keillor</a> starting submitting stories to magazines he changed/"extended" his first name to Garrison because it sounded more distinguished.
</li><li> Civil rights activist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> was born with the name Michael King, as was his father. The elder King changed both their names in honour of Martin Luther when the younger King was five years old — King Jr. grew up to become a Protestant preacher.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls">French Foreign Legion</a> used to require applicants to sign up under a different name, though this is now optional.
</li><li> After the fall of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FascistItaly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FascistItaly">Fascist Italy</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the destroyer <em>Camicia Nera</em> ("Blackshirt") and the battleship <em>Littorio</em> ("Lictor") were renamed <em>Artigliere</em> ("Artilleryman") and <em>Italia</em>, as the previous names were too closely associated with the Fascist regime.
</li><li> During the Turkish War of Independence, three provinces, Maraş, Urfa and Antep, saw some of the heaviest fighting. After independence in 1923, these provinces had honorary titles added to their official names, becoming Kahramanmaraş (Maraş the Heroic), Şanlıurfa (Urfa the Glorious) and Gaziantep (Antep the Veteran<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32t4k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32t4k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32t4k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This title should not be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise">Damned by Faint Praise</a> in comparison with the others. Although the direct translation for "Gazi" is "Veteran", it generally refers to someone heavily injured in the line of duty, similar to a Purple Heart recipient, and therefore denotes significant respect in the Turkish culture</span>). Unlike most examples in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSelectNewCityName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSelectNewCityName">Please Select New City Name</a>, the shorter and longer versions are both acceptable, though the longer versions are considered more formal.
</li><li> Carl Linnaeus, the naturalist who invented taxonomic nomenclature, <em>would</em> have been named Nilsson as per Scandinavian tradition, had his father not adopted this trope to complete his enrollment paperwork at the University of Lund. Needing <em>something</em> to put down as a "family name", Nils chose "Linnaeus" in reference to a gigantic linden tree that grew on the family property.
<ul><li> Carl is better known in modern Sweden as <em>Carl von Linné</em>, which is what he called himself after being knighted. Basically, his family kept changing their surname as they gradually moved up from one social class to another, Nilsson being a farmer's name, Linnaeus being a scholar's name, and von Linné being an aristocrat's name.
</li></ul></li><li> Black civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael adopted the name "Kwame Ture" (in reference to African leaders Kwame Nkrumah and Ahmed Sékou Touré) in order to link his own name to his pan-African ideals, as he rejected the idea that black people should just integrate into white institutions. He passed down the name "Ture" to his children too.
</li><li> An inverse of the example from the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a></em> happened when Richard Nixon resigned. Nixon was onboard Air Force One when his resignation took effect and Ford was sworn in. The pilot then radioed the air traffic controllers to officially change the plane's call sign from Air Force One to SAM 27000 (the standard call sign used for the plane when it wasn't transporting the president).
</li><li> J. D. Vance, most notable as the author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HillbillyElegy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HillbillyElegy">Hillbilly Elegy</a></em>, did this when he married his Yale Law classmate Usha Chilukuri in 2014. The future author, whose last name before the wedding was Hamel, did not want to use the name of the stepfather who had abandoned him, and saw a chance to symbolically start a new life. He and his wife took the name of the grandparents who had largely raised him.
</li><li> The custom of "quốc tính" - "surname of the nation", i.e. the family name of the king, since the king is the father of the nation - appeared briefly in Vietnamese history during the Lý and Trần dynasties. It was awarded to people who made great contributions to the ruling dynasty. For example, Lý Thường Kiệt was born Ngô Tuấn (or Quách Tuấn, depending on the source), renamed Ngô Thường Kiệt as an adult, and awarded the surname Lý for his military successes and wise counsel. This was stopped in 1467 (the Lê dynasty), and Emperor Lê Thánh Tông allowed descendants of the people awarded surnames to return to their original names.
<ul><li> The custom of renaming continues, after a fashion, to this day. Initially, children were referred to with simple, if not plain "no one sane would actually call your child that" names, in order to avoid attracting demonic attention. It was believed that demons liked children with beautiful names, and would kill the children. They would be addressed with fancier names upon adulthood. The rigors on this custom has relaxed, as children nowadays can get "home names" like Puppy, Kitty, or even foreign-sounding names. However, as compulsory education came into effect, children had to be addressed by their legal names at school. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> (or aggravation) annually for teachers, because many parents forget to teach their first-graders to respond to their legal names.
