Stranger still, all this can still hold true if the woman in question has already been established as a badass (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">Chickification</a>). As a mark of the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> this trope exemplifies, a woman is more likely to lose the audience's favor by getting another <em>woman</em> killed than by getting a man killed.
</p><p>The boundaries between this trope and one that it spawned (the existence of characters who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">Wouldn't Hit a Girl</a>), are sometimes confusing and difficult to define, but as a general rule, that trope refers to when characters within the story are unwilling to harm women, this one refers to when the story <em>itself</em> seemingly refuses to let a woman come to harm. The disparity is most obvious when the source of danger that is threatening the cast has no actual intelligence or sentient character of its own, as when you see the rampaging T-rex, tornado, human-killing robot uprising, nuclear bomb, or hungry zombie horde ignore a female character in favor of killing a male one, with no plausible or justified reason for them doing so other than the author doesn't want a woman to be hurt. Conversely, this trope could be a meta-example of Would Not Hit A Girl from the author.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Perhaps strangest of all, this trope also bleeds over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains">villain roles</a>: the suffering and death of female villains is generally either not dwelt upon or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">played for sympathy</a>, if only because they are generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">less evil than their male counterparts</a>. But the suffering and death of <em>male</em> villains, on the other hand, is much more acceptable if only because they are often so much, well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">eviler</a></em>.
</p><p>About the only place where this is usually averted is in the horror genre, but even then, there's usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">clear disparity</a> in male vs. female deaths - male deaths are <em>much</em> more likely to be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious">comically</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">portrayed</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend">quickly forgotten about</a>.
</p><p>The consequences in fiction of this are complicated, but in summary:
</p><p></p><ul><li> If the story requires random anonymous characters to die just to move the plot forward, they'll likely be male. If the plot requires a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">tragic death that motivates the protagonists</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">shows how evil the villains are</a>, the victim will be female. One exception to this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> that is commonly committed by a man and often for a woman and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>. Similarly if the story demands random mooks get a beat down by a character to up the sense of danger or because they are generic enemies in a video game, or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">show off how awesome</a> the protagonist is, they will be male. If there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> that includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">one woman</a>, when the party gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">cut down one by one</a> expect the lone woman's survival to be basically guaranteed. In fact, if there's one woman in the party she's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfMortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfMortality">safer than the actual protagonist</a>, who might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies">still perish</a> in the climax - especially if it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">for her sake</a>. If the male and female leads have had sex at any point during the story, the safest place for a man to stand is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">directly behind that woman</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Female villains are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">more likely to be redeemed</a> and/or have sympathetic justification for their villainy, especially if the main hero is a man. They are also less likely to be taken seriously or depicted unsympathetically in their schemes. Only exception is when a female villain kills children <em>with her own hands</em> (simply giving the order isn't enough) or, more rarely, if she kills helpless (i.e., elderly or disabled) adults in a particularly brutal way. In other words, female villains are only taken seriously if they walk into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> territory.
</li><li> Male characters get more explicit and brutal deaths. It's no secret that viewers are more uncomfortable watching women get tortured, maimed, and/or killed. If a man and a woman are killed in equally grisly ways (or even if the woman's death is <em>less</em> gruesome than the man), the woman's death is still treated as worse. Extra points if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">the camera cuts away</a> right before she gets butchered. If a woman <em>does</em> die, and we actually get to see her body afterwards, expect her never to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsNeverTarnished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsNeverTarnished">look</a></em> dead.
</li><li> Male villains who target female characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">lustfully</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">out of hatred</a>, are portrayed as more evil than those who target men. Female villains who target primarily men, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainessesWantHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainessesWantHeroes">lustfully</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">out of hatred</a>, are often considered sympathetic, often more than a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti Villainous</a>, played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>, or simply not taken seriously.
</li><li> Female-on-female violence is dismissed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">Cat Fight</a>, much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnFemale">rape and molestation</a> which are often played as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> rather than a threat. A woman who targets other women needs to be particularly violent and brutal in her aggression in order to be treated as a serious threat to other women, let alone to a man.
</li><li> If a woman does die in a gruesome or violent way, she's much more likely to be evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">ugly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">or both</a> - or at least <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">portrayed</a></em> as ugly. This partly goes along with the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">protagonist female deaths are tragic</a>, protagonist male deaths are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend">quickly swept under the rug</a>" rule above.
</li><li> Sympathetic male characters are expected to put themselves at risk to protect female characters. Female characters do not lose as much audience sympathy for being unwilling to put themselves at risk to protect characters of either gender and are less likely to be accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">cowardice</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Another" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Another">Another</a></em> manages rather oddly to both subvert and play this straight. It's subverted in that, in a class with roughly equivalent male and female ratios, only a handful of onscreen deaths are male, and by the end of the series (the novel as well; the manga subverts this slightly) only <em>one</em> of the main female characters is still alive (in fairness, she's functionally the only female character in the novel, so this isn't hard). It's subverted in that, when male deaths <em>do</em> occur, their repercussions are generally downplayed or flat-out not brought up: the first major onscreen death is a girl, which leads to one of the main conflicts in the final episode; a male student's death midway through is <em>implied</em> to have caused a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> for a female student, but this is never outright stated, while her own death is the main thing that sets the two main groups at odds. In a series which features two rather gruesome and bloody throat injuries and dismemberment by <em>boat motor,</em> the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a> is also reserved for one girl, who bloodlessly (but still painfully) is strangled to death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>: The only female character to even get noticeably injured in the bloody events aboard the Flying Pussyfoot is Rachel — and we never actually see her injury, only the gunshot and her subsequently bandaged leg.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Earlier on, there's a limited example of the lack of anonymous women in the Soul Society arc. At the beginning, Soul Reapers are generally being used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, and all such are male, as opposed to the leading cadre which includes a handful of females. Once the named characters have been shown enough that we can start sympathetically viewing Soul Reapers as a group, we start seeing Academy flashbacks in which a reasonable proportion of the anonymous Soul Reapers are female, and proceed from there, making it clear this trope is the <em>Raison d'être</em>.
<ul><li> This is especially apparent in the Arrancar and Hueco Mundo Arcs, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only two female arrancars in the manga die, one of whom is revived. In contrast, over 20 named male arrancars are permanently killed in the manga</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>: Part 5 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em> Downplays this and also exaggerates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenFemale">Trish Una's</a> survival was a driving plot point, but what happens to her at the end makes it very bizarre.

This kills her. Diavolo's <em>main goal</em> was to kill her. But as her soul left her body, Bruno (Who swapped bodies with Diavolo, while Diavolo swapped with Mista, who swapped bodies with Trish) breaks the sun behind his head, which kills Silver Chariot Requiem (The creature responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">body swapping fiasco</a>). As a result it's abilities are undone, returning everyone to their original bodies. Trish (Whos sharing Mista's body with Diavolo) is returned to her original body as is everybody elses. Reviving her in the spot</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>: Plays this completely straight. On the one hand, many women die horribly. On the other hand, the characters very directly responsible for most of the death are girls, whom we are still expected to feel sympathetic for even after they slaughter dozens of people, innocent or not. And when a scientist shoots a rampaging disclonius, we are expected to see him as a heartless bastard. Also, most of the women killed off get a slow-motion sequence to go with it, while the guys get their heads torn off with brutal swiftness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> mixes this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial">Men Are Generic, Women Are Special</a>. You would be hard-pressed to find a random ninja that was female. Pretty much any female in the series is important in some way, and outside of flashbacks (where women tend to die much more often, and even then they are still rarely generic), important [good] characters very rarely die, and if someone does die, they are likely male. This becomes really noticeable when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ninja world unites to take on Madara and a shot of the united army is shown. If there are random female ninja there, they are buried under the males</span>. So when the ninja casualties start happening, only men tend to die.
</li><li> A similar thing also happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, just replace ninja with soldiers. Thankfully it is a bit more justified and lenient about it, it's set in a 20s setting so female soldiers would be uncommon (they still are, for reasons of this trope), and even then, many characters that are male get lingering shots and it's shown with Mustang that to him, his men are not expendable, his friends are not mooks merely sent to die. I.E an example of a lingering shot on a dead male character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Colonel Maes Hughes</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em>: The two main characters are female assassins who mow down the male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a></em>, the trope is completely inverted. A plague reduces the male population to one-fifth of the total. Men thus become very valuable, especially for their seed, and are kept out of harm's way and carefully bartered.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>: Despite the high death count, all the female Saints — Marin, Shaina, and June — manage to survive while all but the five main bronze boys die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls">Sky Girls</a></em>: Mentioned but never expanded upon. It was stated that nearly 90% of the male population aged 20-30 was wiped out in the first war with the WORMS. Among the surviving humans actually seen, however, there appear to be just as many young adult men as women.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em>: Men are pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> for the Neuroi, on the other hand, the show treats all deaths as equally tragic, even Minna's boyfriend was given a well-rounded backstory which is more than can be said for a lot of male deaths in such stories. Witches are the only ones who can seriously harm Neuroi, conventional weapons are fairly effective but not nearly as much. Obviously the military brass are not too happy that the women are getting all the military glory while the men are sent back in body bags or soup cans, on the other hand, it's not expanded upon exactly how much male combatants are actually involved in direct combat and as such it seems that most men are limited mostly to support roles while the Witches do all the heavy lifting. Most instances where men actually do fight seem more accidental than intentional. The fact that there are no non-Witch women serving on the front-lines is on the other hand justified by simple reality and explained in-universe. The brass originally didn't want girls on the battlefield just like in real life which is why they were almost all male but had to conscript teenage magical girls because nothing else was effective. Despite this, there do appear to be non-Witch women serving on battleships but even their roles are not elaborated upon. If there's any reason women aren't being hired as cannon fodder it's because the brass doesn't want women killed unless absolutely necessary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> tends to follow its Shonen brethren in this issue, in that women are often seen in combat roles, but only in positions of authority (the show has been accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">The Smurfette Principle</a>, but women are numerous enough generally to dodge that) and never in the faceless pirate/marine hordes that serve as cannon fodder. The closest comes in with Amazon Lily, where, by the island's nature, women had to serve as mooks. Civilians, meanwhile, tend to be a realistically even mix.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>. Would you expect anything less of what is essentially an action movie parody?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> tends to zigzag this trope and mixes it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">Females Are More Innocent</a>: on one hand, you have the Night King arc where the presence of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a> warranted a high female death toll; on the other hand, this was the only time this would occur and, after that arc, you would be hard-pressed to see a woman die brutally. In addition, there aren't many villainesses in the series and neither one was ever killed for what she did... unlike male villains who are almost always dealt with permanently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> averts this pretty much across the board. The military sees men and women serving together in all capacities, and being slaughtered in roughly equal numbers. Whether their death is played as tragic or not depends less on gender, and more on that particular character or the senselessness of their death. Among the Trainees killed at Trost, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Marco's</span> death is the only one played as tragedy while the girls killed are mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a> never mentioned again. Civilians can be of either gender, and there doesn't seem to be any sort of "Women and Children first" standard in play. The Titans play with this in a strange way, as while they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> and <em>appear</em> to be male; in reality, Titans lack any sort of external sexual organs and may or may not even have a distinct gender.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove">Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!</a></em> thanks to all the non-lethal combat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> averts this. Men and women die over the course of the story and whether or not their deaths are noteworthy depends heavily on their role in the narrative. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> has said in interviews that she feels she kills her male characters off too easily. In particular, she regretted killing Jadeite off so early once she heard his voice for the anime.

<ul><li> Two male astronauts who survived the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide">Gendercide</a> by being in orbit when it happened die ensuring the survival of their female crewmate after a fiery re-entry, because she was pregnant with a baby that could have belonged to either of them. Their deaths are shrugged off by the characters with a sort of "What idiots but hey a baby!" reaction.
</li><li> Also, male corpses are pictured in an advanced state of decomposition as well as piled on each other and loaded into a garbage truck. Female corpses, on the other hand, are handled with a lot more discretion. This is probably because there are just so many bodies that they can't deal with them all like they should, and the woman who Yorrick sees loading men in a dump truck does go out of her way to see every man gets a proper funeral at the end of her one-shot and states how disgraceful it was to the men.
<ul><li> However, Yorick is shown mostly being disgusted by male corpses, even if those corpses are those of his loved ones. In comparison, having to defend himself with fatal force against a woman trying to kill him is portrayed as so traumatizing it causes his mind to start shutting down, as opposed to the death of every other man on Earth.
</li><li> And while the comic tries the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> of saying that males will (eventually) get an (offscreen) funeral, every on-page portrayal of dealing with them shows the corpses being thrown in piles in trucks or for burning, emphasizing that their deaths are purely treated as the impetus for starting the story, a plot hook. Virtually every female death in the series is treated with at least some form of dignity, up to and including a massive state funeral.

The only reason for having only the men killed appears to be this trope.

Bendis's reply was that, looking back over the stories the reader mentioned, three women had been brutally killed, but so had something like forty men.

Before her death, four supporting characters had been killed off in-story really without causing a ripple among readers, all men of various ages: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Uncle Ben</a>, Bennett Brant (Betty's brother, caught in the crossfire to provide a reason for her to hate Spider-Man), Frederick Foswell (<em>Daily Bugle</em> reporter) and George Stacy (Gwen's father, died trying to save people's lives to provide an obstacle to her romance with Peter Parker). In later years <em>The Death of Jean DeWolff</em>, the second female supporting character to be killed off, caused another major stir. The deaths of various male supporting characters — Professor Miles Warren, Nathan Lubensky (Aunt May's fiancé), Ned Leeds (one of Peter's oldest <em>Bugle</em> colleagues), and even Harry Osborn (Peter Parker's oldest and <em>best friend</em> of the male persuasion) — not so much. Harry Osborn who, as it turned out, could not well be replaced in his role in the cast, but that was fourteen years after his death. Even Aunt May (whose apparent death in <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> #400 was widely seen as a satisfying ending to a fulfilled life) was brought back to the living more quickly. And while only Uncle Ben is referenced in-story nearly as often as Gwen Stacy, quite a few of the dead male characters are all but forgotten both by the writers and the fans.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> comic has Conan finding out just how many of the men he is presently dealing with (most of whom need killing) have had carnal knowledge of his current concubine. She responds with a quiet dignity, "it's not easy being a woman in a man's world." Conan then bluntly subverts the trope by countering, "You should try being a man in it."

</li><li> No females died in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push">Push</a></em>. There were two female villains, and neither died. They were specifically scripted to not have done anything too bad that they can cross the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>. They at least didn't kill anyone, but merely get in the way of the heroes. One pulled a gun and was about to kill someone but was stopped just in time to avoid facing Karma. Conversely, all the male villains, including mooks died, regardless of whether they killed anyone or not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetTerror">Planet Terror</a></em> kills off nearly every male character of consequence while having all the female characters but one survive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHappening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHappening">The Happening</a></em>, almost all onscreen deaths are male and often gruesome. Women get injured — or pick up guns — but do not die onscreen and not nearly in the same numbers. The one woman who dies gruesomely (off-screen) is established as unlikable prior to her death. Since this is about a neurotoxin released by plants in populated areas, the difference in the film's treatment of male vs. female death is particularly <em>un</em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifiable</a>, except explicitly as an instance of this trope.
</li><li> When Grendel attacks the hall in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beowulf2007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beowulf2007">Beowulf</a></em>, he targets all men, except for one woman whose death was far less explicit (as it was implied but not seen) than that of her male companions. The hall was filled at the time with revelers of both genders. Possibly justified as the women there would be civilians (and thus likely to run for their lives) while the men were the king's soldiers (who would thus stay and fight and die). Plus, well, he's implied to be kind of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a>.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> trilogy none of the Rebel pilots or grunts are female, at least until Leia insists on going on the mission to Endor. This is particularly striking in the first film when the Rebel pilots flying against the Death Star are all male, even though the idea of women combat pilots is now widely accepted both in real life and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> (such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em>). The special editions did add in a brief shot of a female X-Wing pilot checking in prior to the Death Star attack, but since she was apparently added just for the sake of Lucas proving he wasn't a sexist, she's never shown thereafter; certainly she isn't shown dying in an explosion like most of the X-Wing pilots that aren't Luke.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTwelve">2012</a></em> three out of five of the male main characters die. One out of three of the female main characters die. The women are routinely shielded from bad news by the men. During the climactic scene where the stowaways have to fix the mechanical problem, they created by stowing away illegally, only the male protagonist and his son attempt to fix it. Despite the fact that the female protagonist is just as responsible and, presumably, as an adult stronger and more competent than her ten-year-old son.
</li><li> This is lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathRace">Death Race</a></em>. All of Machinegun Joe's navigators somehow keep dying during every race, so he's the only racer with male navigators so as not to unnerve viewers. Also played straight in the movie itself, where we see many explicit deaths of the male racers, while (most of) the deaths of the female navigators are either offscreen or implied. By contrast, the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathRace2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathRace2000">Death Race 2000</a></em> featured the deaths of most of the female drivers and navigators and running down women was worth 10 points more than men in all age categories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010">The Wolfman (2010)</a></em> is a big offender; dozens of men are killed and messily dismembered on-screen while the very few female deaths are merely implied. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Or, in the case of Lawrence's mother played for maximum tragedy and horror as against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a> the male victims go through.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange2016">Doctor Strange (2016)</a></em>, antagonist Kaecilius is accompanied by a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> known as the Zealots, who consist of nine male members and two female members. All of the male members are killed before the final battle, while both female members survive, albeit experiencing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.
</li><li> An early version of the screenplay for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProfessional">The Professional</a></em> provides a very clear example of this trope. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> demonstrates his Big Badditude by coldbloodedly massacring Mathilda's family, including her father, mother, teenage sister and infant brother. The sympathetic Leon and his protégé adhere to a "no women, no children" creed; gunning down random men in a park for target practice is just fine. This got toned down in the production to having Mathilda shoot just one man in the park with a paint pellet, and asking to "use real bullets next time", but the fact that the original idea was even considered is telling. Additionally, countless male mooks are massacred, together with a SWAT team (who were only doing their jobs, albeit for a corrupt boss), and Leon's contracted targets who were never depicted doing anything unsympathetic.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">Predator</a></em> film has the party of main characters getting gruesomely killed off except for two people: the main character and the party's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmurfettePrinciple">sole female</a>, how convenient! It's averted (regarding minor characters, at least) during the subway massacre in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator2">Predator 2</a></em> where it kills male and female commuters alike. Also averted if you count <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienVsPredator">Alien vs. Predator</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliensVsPredatorRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliensVsPredatorRequiem">Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem</a></em>, but then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">most don't.</a>
</li><li> While most of the characters survive their encounter with the killer crocodile in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rogue">Rogue</a></em>, those who don't are all male and the only female character to become trapped in the crocodile's jaws ends up surviving.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">Braveheart</a></em> spends one scene on William Wallace's grief over the deaths of his father and brother, but the death of his wife is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionalTorque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionalTorque">Emotional Torque</a> that drives the rest of the film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic (1997)</a></em>, there are dozens of male corpses floating around in the water, but the lingering shot is on a woman with her young baby. True to the event, many men are shown choosing to give their spots on the lifeboats to women and children. The trope is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Molly Brown who chides the other women for leaving their men behind to save themselves.
</li><li> Almost every secondary character dies over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans2010">Clash of the Titans (2010)</a></em> but the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a> is a much bigger deal to Perseus; later Zeus brings her back to life, but everyone else stays dead. This was due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> since Io was meant to stay dead and Perseus would have ended up with Andromeda with Io and Perseus's relationship being more brother/sister. The studio disagreed. This was also inverted with the death of Andromeda's mother, which got swept under the rug as quickly as any faceless mook. Several of the male characters who died in the fight against Medusa were given far more import. The sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WrathOfTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WrathOfTheTitans">Wrath of the Titans</a></em> has Ares massacring Andromeda's army. He kills about five male soldiers with no fanfare. But when he stabs the lone female, it's presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>. The death that serves as the movie's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch">Gut Punch</a> is that of a male, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neytiri's father</span>. The movie likewise kills off two developed females in the final battle, with only one significant male death. The rest of the male protagonists survive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpirit">The Spirit</a></em> many male characters are killed off with their deaths often played for black comedy. All female characters whether good or bad are allowed to survive the film.
</li><li> The first death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a></em> is female. It is also the only female death in the film out of 5. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of the 4 characters who meet the villain and survive, all are female.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes2">The Hills Have Eyes 2</a></em>, the sequel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes2006">the remake</a>, has some unnamed woman die at the beginning, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>both the female characters in the movie survive</em> while only one out of the males does</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splice">Splice</a></em> is a very blatant perpetrator of this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> every major character except the females dies. Dren is only killed after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurkeAndHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurkeAndHare">Burke and Hare</a></em> (based on the real life <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_and_Hare_murders">Burke and Hare murders<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) tries to make its main characters sympathetic. Consequently, they almost exclusively murder (young) men (some of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">asshole victims</a>). In contrast, the real life murders were almost exclusively women (the exceptions being an elderly man, a mentally disabled man, and a blind child).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, it's suggested that on some level Bruce Wayne feels angry at his father for not defeating the murderer, protecting himself and Bruce's mother, and saving Bruce from emotional trauma and orphanhood. The possibility that Bruce's mother could have done anything whatsoever to protect herself, her husband and her child, let alone that she <em>should</em> have, is never even suggested. This despite the fact that the murderer had a gun and none of the Waynes were armed, so Martha probably stood about as much of a chance of defeating him as her larger and presumably stronger husband did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>:
<ul><li> Batman chooses to save love interest Rachel Dawes instead of Harvey Dent and Dent yells at his rescuers that they should rescue <em>her</em> (then again, he is in love with Rachel). Rachel ends up dying and Harvey continues to live, though he dies at the end of the film anyways.
</li><li> The only corrupt cop on Maroni's payroll to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">sympathetic motive</a> for being on the take is the female Ramirez, where the corrupt male cops are treated as spineless cowards. Ramirez is <em>also</em> the only one to face Two-Face's coin-flip judgement and live.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlexanderNevsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlexanderNevsky">Alexander Nevsky</a></em>, most of the women stay home while the men go out to fight. There is at least one female soldier who is allowed to fight (without anyone trying to stop her), but she gets declared as the bravest soldier on the battlefield at the end of the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigBoss">The Big Boss</a></em>: The hero had plenty of friends in his foster family, and his love interest is the only woman present. Guess who is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of the family when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> sends his mooks to massacre the entire household.
</li><li> There's only one female victim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UncleSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UncleSam">Uncle Sam</a></em>, and her death is completely offscreen. She's also never named and has about one minute of screen time.
</li><li> <em>Mother's Day</em> (the 2010 film, not the 1980 flick it is loosely based on) has seven male characters and nine female ones. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> six of the seven men die while only three of the women do - and all three women who die are presented as someway 'unsympathetic' (one is an adulteress who has been sleeping with the heroine's husband and the other two are spoilt and obnoxious rich girls and very minor characters to boot). The men who die regardless of whether they are presented as sympathetic or not.</span>.
</li><li> Up until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">the fourth film</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> franchise, no human female characters were killed and the first death (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zara</span>) was also the only human female to die in the film. Much of this stems from an absence of human female characters in the franchise, with the fourth film being the first to have more than two in danger. This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">the first film</a> when Ellie is disgusted by Hammond implying he should put himself in danger instead of her simply because he's a man, despite also being an old man who needs a cane to walk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005">King Kong (2005)</a></em> has this trope in spades. Ann Darrow, the beauty to the beast, is the only major female character and survives the film relatively unscathed. On the other hand, numerous male crew members (seventeen by the film's count) die in the attempt to save her - including the only two non-white cast members. Of the natives killed in the initial clash, only a man is shown shot to death. Kong does accost several women in New York trying to find Ann, but none of them are explicitly shown to have been killed or even seriously injured. Though the male deaths are treated sympathetically, the comparatively brutal and gory nature of them makes this trope seem especially egregious.
</li><li> The 2007 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> plays this straight with no women being killed throughout the entire film. There are sequences that deliberately spare female characters including several deleted scenes, one of which where after killing all the male henchmen and executing his target, Agent 47 leaves the room but as he does it is revealed that all the women in the room safely survived the carnage.
</li><li> The main reason there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">no female giants</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackTheGiantSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackTheGiantSlayer">Jack the Giant Slayer</a></em> or the fact Isabelle is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">the only female</a> as the director didn't want any women killed in the film.
</li><li> In the French film <em>Baise-Moi</em>, two women abandon their morals after a savage sexual assault (where a group of men rape them). In an act of revenge, the women go on a wild lark littered with sexual escapades and murder. Although a few women do get murdered in the film, the movie has an excessive amount of violence towards men with little to no regard as the men are written off as pigs. In a sequence at a bar/brothel, the women choose to kill many of the patrons participating in sexual acts in the back. After the massacre, the camera pans around the room only slowing down on two of the female victims while clearly passing over the dead male victims with no consideration. Even during the attack, all the men are killed in graphic detail on-screen while the few women get discretion shots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenSwallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenSwallow">Golden Swallow</a></em> had an onscreen death toll of roughly 250 people (including a child!) and all of them are male. The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">Hooker with a Heart of Gold</a> supporting character survives. Of all the named characters, with the exception of one, as long as its a male with more than two lines of dialogue, they'll be dead before the credits.
</li><li> The 1990 film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHandmaidsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHandmaidsTale">The Handmaid's Tale</a></em> begins with a short scene, not in the book<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bg05');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bg05" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bg05');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">but maybe implied in it?</span> where Offred, her husband and daughter attempt to flee Gilead. As border security orders them to stop, Offred's husband runs out of the frame in an attempt to distract them while Offred and her daughter try to get away. The point of the scene is to explain how Offred has been forced into Handmaidhood, but the husband's behavior is extremely irrational given the situation and serves only to get him written out of the plot.
</li><li> In the 1972 made-for-tv disaster movie, <em>Short Walk To Daylight</em>, nine characters, five men and four women are introduced in a subway car before a big earthquake hits, leaving them trapped underground. The unnamed train conductor dies from injuries after being buried in rubble. Later on, as the remaining eight try finding a way out, a junkie starts acting wild and irrational due to going through withdrawal after he and his girlfriend have separated from the others to go their own way and ends up throwing himself on the subway's third rail and dying of electrocution. Afterwards, the tunnels are being flooded and the survivors must cross the huge leak by shimming along a set of pipes, and the train's motorman (the only character who didn't know how to swim) is the last to cross but falls in the water when the pipes break, where he drowns and is swept away. After one more obstacle, the rest of the survivors finally find an exit, with three out of five men dying, and all four women surviving.
</li><li> An in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></em>, as the War Boys as a whole are taught from a young age that not only are they expendable, but that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture">death in battle is the only way to reach Valhalla</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors">Tremors</a></em>, the Graboids kill several people, but their only female victim is Megan. Her death is probably the least gory because instead of being eaten, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">Buried Alive</a> and suffocates offscreen. Afterwards, there are no more women killed until the fifth movie.
</li><li> During the siege of Helms Deep in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Two Towers</a></em>, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Theoden draft every male that looks to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">eight years old</a> and up to shore up their defenses, while the women, girls, and any boy too young to fight are told to flee into the mountains if Saruman's army breaks through. We only see a couple of pre-pubescent boys throw rocks from high up on the castle walls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">but the implications are hard to ignore considering the Uruk-hai's use of volley fire from their powerful crossbows.</a>

Both groups include one woman. Out of these nine people, only the women and one other rescuer make it back alive. The end result is that four men give their lives so that one woman can be rescued.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em> has every male member of Thor's Asgardian team get slaughtered (most completely offhandedly) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hela" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hela">Hela</a>. The sole female member is not only absent (allowing her to avoid being killed) but is simply never mentioned, to avoid any questions of why she didn't turn up to help. Also neither Hela nor Valkyrie, the only female main characters, even take a single injury in the course of the film (barring Hela's final death by bloodless vaporization); the same definitely could not be said for the male characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter">Manhunter</a></em> Will Graham's half-cocked plan at the end once he knows the killer's identity gets two policemen killed in order to rescue the final victim. The framing following the encounter shows the film lets us know it was more important to rescue Reba than to wait for backup.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016">Deadpool (2016)</a></em>: Colossus takes the time to rescue Angel Dust rather than allow her to be blown up in the final explosion.

Afterward, he apologizes and says if they had been three men, they could have all stayed and fought, but he could not leave her in danger.
</li><li> The original novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> has a mention of men and women pilots kissing goodbye to each other before the attack on the Death Star. There are no female Imperials ever seen, although the Expanded Universe retconned this, saying the Empire was sexist. All of Jabba's thugs in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> are also men. In the prequel trilogy, all of the pod racers (one of whom dies in the race) and Naboo soldiers and guards in the first movie are male, plus all of the clone troopers in the second and third are male. In the case of the clone troopers, this is because they are all cloned from the same man. <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> subverts this trope, though, and shows both male and female Jedi being massacred when the clone troopers carry out Order 66. The fact that there are only male villains, but male and female Jedi, plays to the trope though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rand goes to considerable effort to remember every woman who died for him (including the one who died because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">wouldn't fight back against the evil sorceress trying to kill them all</a>). The considerably more numerous men can apparently go hang. It's not really clear where this attitude comes from, seeing as the women of Two Rivers aren't exactly delicate flowers.
</li><li> The trope also plays out in the city of Ebou Dar, where men give women a knife on their wedding day. To quote the other wiki, "By custom, the wife is to stab the husband with this knife if he should ever displease her."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> plays this straight. There are female pilots, but all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">infantry</a> are male. The movie and its first direct-to-video sequel, however, subvert this and include female infantry, many of whom are killed in battle. However, the second direct-to-video sequel surprisingly played this straight. Seven people are stranded on a planet — five men and two women — and only the women survive. Also, pretty much everyone else killed in the movie was male.
</li><li> Although inverted (once) near the end of book three, most of <em>The Black Jewels Trilogy</em> lives and dies (pun intended) by this trope.
</li><li> Scott Adams lampshades this in his blog turned book "Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain", saying that the reason that the military is composed mainly of men is because their deaths aren't as much of a tragedy; if it were children, people with special needs, or other groups of people, there would be no war because it would be too tragic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>, the villain hordes, while not exclusively male, have many more males than females. The hordes are usually wiped out. The male heroes/goodbeasts also have a higher rate of death or injury than the females do.
</li><li> Dr. Warren Farrell examines this trope (which he calls "male disposability") in <em>The Myth of Male Power</em>, which is about the ways the system that feminists often call "patriarchy" serves to harm men as well as women. Adam Jones wrote <em><a class="urllink" href="http://adamjones.freeservers.com/effacing.htm">Effacing the Male: Gender, Misrepresentation, and Exclusion in the Kosovo War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which examines the way this trope applies to discussions about victims of war.

All else is surplusage, excrescence, adornment, luxury, or folly, which can  and must  be dumped in emergency to preserve this prime function. As racial survival is the only universal morality, no other basic is possible. Attempts to formulate a "perfect society" on any foundation other than "Women and children first!" is not only witless, it is automatically genocidal. Nevertheless, starry-eyed idealists (all of them male) have tried endlessly  and no doubt will keep on trying.</em>

Someone who kills a man is therefore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">instantly</a> seen as a monster; meanwhile, the deaths of criminal women and female marines alike are only remarked on in passing. There is a single case of a family where only the fifteen-year-old brother survived, and <em>that</em> was because spies for the enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm">abducted him</a> before the enemy killed every single other family member. This is in the backstory, and the narrative is not clear on whether the enemy would have killed the brother, or instead considered him neutral and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm">arranged a suitable marriage for him.</a>

<ul><li> An iPad app breaks down the series and tracks the deaths throughout the books. Overall, there have been 1,528 male deaths, 26 female deaths, and 207 children killed. The male deaths take up 85% of the deaths in the series whereas the females only take up 2% (children take up 13%). The series has many battles in it, but it takes full advantage of killing as many men as possible while keeping the females very clearly out of harm's way.
</li><li> Early on in the first book one instance introduces the recurring character Osha, a wildling who is found running through the woods with a gang of other wildlings when they come across a young Stark. They try and steal his horse but are interrupted by the young Stark's brother. He and his partner kill all the wildlings except Osha, but in an aversion, there was another woman with them who was killed (unceremoniously) by Grey Wind the direwolf along with the three men (one of whom has more focus and is the only one besides Osha named). Played straighter in the TV-Series adaptation, where Osha is the only woman and there are two men who die.

Their brother Peter gets a sword and shield and no such warning against using them proactively, presumably because it's somehow less "ugly" when it's men doing the fighting and dying.

</li><li> Literally the case on Lyrane II in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Second Stage Lensmen</a></em>, where the males exist only for the purpose of procreation, and when they have sired enough children they are killed via mind-blast.

They all wind up dead by the end of their arcs.

<ul><li> In an episode, Ivanova futilely tries to prevent one ship from firing on another by crying out, "There are women and children on board!" This is an especially weird example since Ivanova herself is a woman and never hesitates to put herself in danger even if it's something a male character could take care of. Either she was trying to play on the shooters' sexism, or she somehow forgot that "women and children" is not a synonym for "civilians" despite being a woman and a soldier herself.
</li><li> Na'Toth, a female Narn and a warrior, has done the same thing. This is even more strange than the Ivanova example since one would assume the Narn don't carry the same cultural baggage we Humans do, and wouldn't necessarily consider women to be more helpless than men by default. Narn women all seem to be tough as their men, with no indication of sexist norms in their culture.

The camera lingers on the woman, and another man is shown coming to her aid and holding her; the man shot with the crossbow is apparently irrelevant as he isn't seen again nor is it shown that anyone comes to his aid.

Although the show plays this trope straight in that far more men die, and all the mooks cut down are male, there's an emotional subversion in that neither of the female deaths is counted as particularly heinous, whereas some male deaths are hugely emotional and serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> or other important moments for the female mains.

Note that just moments before his arrival, the girls' teacher was sharing stories with a room full of small children that could <em>easily</em> fit with the most radical of Taliban doctrine if the genders were reversed. After the entire episode shows just how badly things could go in that kind of environment, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the ending goes and shows that there are other men, all in cryostasis, and the narrator basically proclaims that humanity doesn't really need the male gender, aside from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorifiedSpermDonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorifiedSpermDonor">Glorified Sperm Donor</a>.

<ul><li> In "Exile on Main St.", Dean is attacked by three Djinn, two male one female. He beats one to death, his grandfather stabs another and a third they trap in a sack. Guess which one was female.
</li><li> There's also the season 1 episode "Nightmare", wherein a young psychic kills his father and uncle, and would have killed the stepmother if not for Sam.
</li><li> There is also the hunter Gordon, who it seems every time he pops up tells a tale of how he killed/tortured a monstrous or possessed woman, just to show how terrible a person he is. Even though, as noted below, the brothers do the same thing.
</li><li> The ratio of deaths is roughly 2:1 (male:female) throughout the series (as of S6, total of 227 male deaths to 116 female deaths).

</li><li> Far more men (or about double) are killed quickly to set the scene for any given episode, but <em>Supernatural</em> subverts this with recurring female characters. Mary, Ellen, and Jo all sacrifice themselves (rather pointlessly) to support Sam and Dean's endeavors, Pamela is killed while helping them, as is Charlie, and Ruby is obviously set to defend them with her life, whatever her reasons may be. None of these really fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">Women in Refrigerators</a> trope either, because with the exception of Mary (and Charlie, whose death does cause some tension between the boys for Sam's getting her involved in what she was doing at the time), Sam and Dean feel bad for like two minutes and then move on.

With the exception of Andrea, however, they are all willing to allow the men to do the far more dangerous job of protecting the camp from the Walkers. When Rick suggests traveling back to Atlanta to retrieve a bag full of guns, the group that goes is all male, to use one of many examples from the show.
</li><li> In Season 7, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Negan</a> says that he has no problem killing men, but tries to avoid killing women if he can.

<ul><li> While the background material hints that there are just as many females as there are males in the Imperial Guard Army, most of the Imperial Guard Models are all male, with few to no female variants throughout the years. Other races tend to have one set of "female" traits for every 3 "male" traits (breastplates mostly). One whole regiment of Imperial Guard is made up solely of males as well, the aptly named Vostroyan Firstborne (made of firstborn sons). Space Marines may be this at a glance, due to genetics basically making female space marines in fluff impossible, but are largely balanced because each new initiate marine is still infinitely more valuable than 10k imperial guard women and that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>, the Sisters of Battle, are all female.

<ul><li> Played with a bit, but generally averted, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series, where all victims (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victims</a>) are treated with at least a degree of sympathy and their murderers (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">sympathetic ones</a>) are not pardoned for their crimes, regardless of gender.
<ul><li> The first five games contain twenty-three cases and only five female murder victims: Cindy Stone, Mia Fey, Valerie Hawthorne, Elise Deuxnim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> AKA Misty Fey</span>, and Cece Yew (who only was a murder victim in the backstory of the case). Three of these women are treated to far more grief than the typical murder victim. However, of the three who <em>are</em> given more compassion, two of them were genuinely sympathetic and plot-important characters, and the other was an innocent who was killed because she happened to possess evidence that would have brought down an international smuggling ring. Cece's role as the tragic "innocent victim" is by no means unique, nor limited to her gender; in case 3-1, for example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doug Swallow was murdered by Dahlia Hawthorne because he tried to warn Phoenix Wright that she was stealing poison from the science lab</span>. He is treated just as sympathetically by the game as Cece. Additionally, the discrepancy between the numbers of male and female deaths can be attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, where men are three times more likely to be the victims of murder than women.
</li><li> It is also important to note that all male victims who are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victims</a> are treated to the same amount of sympathy as female non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victims</a>, and female murderers whose victims were male (i.e. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dahlia Hawthorne to Doug Swallow and Terry Fawles, with attempts on Diego Armando and Phoenix Wright</span>) are not given any leniency because of their sex (the aforementioned character is arguably the evilest and most unforgivable villain in the series). Male victims are also never shamed or made out to look incompetent.
</li><li> In regards to the gruesomeness of the victims' deaths, gender doesn't seem to factor in, and females are murdered just as ruthlessly as males: Cindy and Mia are bashed on their heads by statues <em>onscreen</em>, Valerie and Elise are stabbed in the back, Cece is stabbed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Candice Arme is hit in the head with a heavy bomb, Constance Courte is stabbed <em>with an awl</em>, and Metis Cykes is impaled by a katana</span>; the sheer gruesomeness of the last one's death scene may have been a contributing factor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">the game's</a> M rating.
</li><li> In one case in particular, a male character is blamed by another for not protecting one of the women who died, despite the fact that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a>, was a young rookie at the time, and she was his far more capable and experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorIndex">Mentor</a>. However, the character blaming him (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Godot/Diego Armando</span>) is revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the boyfriend of the deceased who is projecting his own self-loathing for being unable to protect his girlfriend (despite the fact that he had been in a coma during her death and was thus physically unable to do anything to prevent it) onto Phoenix Wright, who was <em>technically,</em> by Godot's reasoning (i.e. he was alive and conscious), in a position to have stopped it</span>. It is neither of their faults that the victim died, and the game makes it quite clear that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Godot</span> is sorely misguided — by having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the victim herself, a channeled Mia Fey</span> point it out to him, thus saving him from himself. It's also worth noting that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Godot</span> is a character with established sexist tendencies, hence his belief that men need to protect women at all costs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em>:
<ul><li> Every human enemy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1">the first game</a> is male. It isn't until the 4th and final expansion pack that you end up fighting a very small handful of female assassins. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> continues with this, with the only female characters you fight in the entire game being the Sheriff of Lynchwood, Laney White, Motor Mamma, and the Sorcerer's Daughter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!</a></em> continues this, even having the main enemy force be led by a female leader despite her being, apparently, the only woman in her unit. The Bandit-like Scavs are all male too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands3">Borderlands 3</a></em>, however, very much averts this, with the reveal trailer prominently featuring several female psychos as normal enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallofDutyModernWarfare2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallofDutyModernWarfare2">Callof Duty Modern Warfare 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyModernWarfare3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyModernWarfare3">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a></em> feature missions where random civilians can be seen running around during shootouts with various enemies. Despite these operations taking place in heavily populated areas, the only time women are present is in the <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> mission "No Russian," where the player is directed to participate in a terrorist attack. Hungarian Resistance fighters who assist the player during <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> are all exclusively male, despite seemingly able-bodied female civilians also being present during most encounters. Female mooks wouldn't appear within the franchise until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</a></em> though by then they are simply present, and not treated as overly remarkable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> averts this trope for the most part, even to the point where the main villainous faction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">Caesar's Legion</a> playing it straight is treated in-universe as one of the many reasons why it's so bad. Which makes it all the more odd in the one instance in the game where it's played unironically straight: The backstory of the Bitter Springs Massacre, where the Great Khan noncombatants accidentally killed by the NCR Army are often described as "women and children" in an obvious attempt to make the incident seem even more tragic, yet it falls flat when the Khans have many female fighters that players can personally kill should they choose to take on the faction.
<ul><li> It also bizarrely comes up in a singular instance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, where Reilly of Reilly's Rangers mentions Talon Company killing a town with "women and children" as why she thinks they give mercenaries a bad name. This is despite the fact that Reilly herself is a woman who is the highly capable leader of a mercenary team (that even has another woman in it), Talon Company having female mercenaries among their ranks, and the Capital Wasteland in general having plenty of fighting women of all stripes, many of whom will die at the player's hands over the course of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series, 99% of generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> are male, and any female enemy is either recruitable or a plot-critical antagonist. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> are the only games to have common female mooks outside of classes that are exclusive to females (pegasus knights and troubadours), even with occasional female mooks sprinkled among the enemy forces, they were still vastly outnumbered by their male comrades. The subsequent Fire Emblem games would end up dropping the concept of liberal use of female mooks altogether. Similarly the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">minor</a> female bosses was only seen in <em>Genealogy of the Holy War</em> before vanishing for good.
</li><li> Despite being a major, multi-million dollar defense contractor, Armacham Technology Corporation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">First Encounter Assault Recon</a></em> somehow managed to only employ one woman at its Fairport offices in the original game, who just happens to be the daughter of one of the company's chief scientists (the most recurring Board Member is also a woman, but she's also unseen until the sequel). When REPLICA forces storm the building, numerous office workers are slaughtered at random, and at one point the player can find soldiers dumping bodies into an elevator shaft: somehow, there are no women among them. The sequel manages to subvert this to some degree: ATC Black Ops mercenaries slaughter their way through the fake Armacham hospital indiscriminate of men and women, but the Remnants, zombified former Fairport residents corrupted by Alma are exclusively male in both the second and third games. The random <em>favela</em> residents running around in the unnamed South American shantytown in the third game's opening also manage to be exclusively male, as are all corpses, and all enemies in all three games.
</li><li> The developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForHonor">For Honor</a></em> said in an interview that their game should be inclusive by having both male and female playable characters. This is what they did with the heroes, though the weaker soldiers and captains are all exclusively male. That said if the soldiers speak your language (that is, they are friendly in multiplayer or are of the same faction as yours during the campaign), their mid-battle chatter will use both male and female voices despite the models being exclusively male.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em>: The first two games and the novelizations play this straight with the military. Only men do the fighting. All fertile women are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryMotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryMotherhood">expected to reproduce</a> to replenish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">war losses</a>, while non-fertile women serve in support roles. The third game, however, subverts this. The women fight alongside the men. This is because humanity is down to its last throes and needs every available body to fight. The prequel also averts this.
</li><li> Meta example between two games: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarAscension">God of War: Ascension</a></em> was met with accusations of misogyny by feminist groups after players received the trophy "Bros Before Hos"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4caxr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4caxr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4caxr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Now "Bros before Foes"</span>, (which occurs after Kratos seemingly kills a single female enemy), despite the fact that the two events were not directly related.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note525x7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note525x7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note525x7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The trophy is awarded because a male character sided with Kratos ("Bro") over the Furies ("Hos"). Interestingly, the woman actually survives unharmed by the end of the scene.</span> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider</a></em> reboot released soon after, gave players the 'Widowmaker' trophy for killing many male enemies, and received no such controversy, despite the fact that the two were <em>explicitly</em> related.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> allows the player to kill men and women at their own leisure as far as pedestrians are concerned. However, there are no female antagonists at all except for Catalina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em>, though her motives for betraying the player character is greed and nothing more.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> scientists and security guards Gordon Freeman encounters in the game are male. Writer Mark Laidlaw joked that all of them stayed home that day because they knew something was wrong, but the real reason is that they wanted to include female scientists, including a sequence where one would betray Gordon, but the system simply couldn't support it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake">Fan Remake</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa">Black Mesa</a></em> adds some female scientists, but all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Headcrab</a> Zombies and guards are still male.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> the Combine Overwatch and Civil Protection units who make up the majority of the enemies the player will kill in the game are humans who are either voluntarily collaborating with the Combine or are being forced to do so and seem to be exclusively male, or at least have male character models. Then again, Combine soldiers are so heavily armored/augmented and even conceal their real voices with voice modulators, so females should be completely indistinguishable from males to the player, making creating a separate model for them pointless. The overly feminine <a class="urllink" href="http://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Combine_Assassin">Combine Assassin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> may have been cut from the game for this very reason. However, no explanation is given as to why Headcrab Zombies are also exclusively male.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxterTheLostFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxterTheLostFrontier">Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier</a></em>, we meet the Aeropans in the beginning and see both men and women (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourChildren">no kids, though</a>) wandering around the city. Once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's revealed that the Aeropans are bad guys, not only do they all become identical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, but they all become male</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Although, under all that heavy armor, it is very hard to be sure.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em> has it to where you can gun down dozens of men, but a woman that shoots you you simply knock out. There is even a side mission where a woman and her two male accomplices are robbing a vault. You gun down both the males but if you gun down the woman you have to restart the mission.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em>. You will fight female Infected, but any non-Infected enemy you encounter will be exclusively male (the exception being a single female who the player can kill in contrast to the dozens of men). However, the Boston Militia is co-ed, and Tommy's group has plenty of armed female members. Whether it's a case of time constraints, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> misogyny, or simply a desire to save money by not hiring female voice actors for the mook dialogue, is hard to say, considering that while there are most definitely women in the group of enemies you face during Winter, they seem to have more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">domestic</a> responsibilities. Also subverted in relation to the main characters: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joel is horrifically wounded and neutralized during the ending of Fall and most of Winter, and since the Laconic for the trope describes itself as "Male suffering is less meaningful than female suffering"..</span>.
<ul><li> Shortly after arriving in Pittsburgh, you can hear two men talking about a woman that tried to fight them off. They considered recruiting her, but they realized that recruiting a woman who already killed some of their own probably wouldn't be a smart idea.
</li><li> In multiplayer, teams will usually consist of three men and one woman, as you can customize what items your character wears, but their model is randomly assigned each game. It is possible, though rarer, to get a team with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">two women and two men or even three women and one man</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> in the exceedingly rare times, Link faces human enemies in the series, they're always males in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">face obscuring armor</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> would introduce female thieves that you had to sneak by in their fortress and you also had to fight some of them to free their prisoners. However, beating the guards causes them to just run away instead of dying. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">The Wicked Witches</a> in the same game are killed, however. This May be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a> however, as several enemies, and boss monsters are identified as female. In the rare times, Link faces human guards with their faces exposed, as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>, they also run away.
</li><li> Most of the zombies you encounter in half the games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series are male. This is averted in the second and third games, as well as the <em>Outbreak</em> spin-offs since the T-Virus escaped in a midwestern city. In the original game and <em>Code: Veronica</em>, the virus infected an isolated laboratory without any listed female personnel and an isolated South American prison complex that either had no female prisoners at all, or stored them on a part of the island that you never visit during gameplay. That being said, female characters are <em>far</em> more likely to survive than their male counterparts, even when the men are far more skilled; of STARS Bravo team, Rebecca Chambers is the squad's rookie and least competent member, yet also the only survivor, and the only woman. In fact, it wouldn't be until <em>Code Veronica</em> that a named female character with actual dialogue would be killed (Ada's death had been implied in <em>Resident Evil 2</em> but that same implication was undone by the end of the game), and the female character in question also manages to be a <em>villain.</em> It wouldn't be until <em>Resident Evil 6</em> that named female heroes would be killed, and to date, no canon ending involves a female player character not surviving.
</li><li> While the Luminoth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> avert this trope as noted in Numerical Aversions below, the Galactic Federation Marine Corps in the same game appear to play this trope almost entirely straight; of the many Marine corpses Samus encounters, only one is confirmed female, with her log entry voicing complaints that she's relegated to noncombat comms duty despite being a better shot than over half of her squadmates, and is heavily implied to be the only woman in the entire squad of dozens of marines. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> is marginally better by having female crewmembers aboard Federation ships during battles, but they're still greatly outnumbered by men and all of the marines that Samus speaks to have male voices. And then there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>, where there are no women in Adam's squad, and the flashbacks to Samus's time in the Federation military show that she's the only woman under Adam's command and outright states that she gets treated differently because of her gender. As a whole, the Metroid franchise implies that the Galactic Federation and humanity in general has something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> attitude, which is rather unexpected for a futuristic civilization. What makes this even more jarring is that the few advanced alien races seen like the aforementioned Luminoth and the Reptilicus from Prime 3 seem to follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject">Gender Is No Object</a>.
</li><li> For a long time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> had no female police officers or playable female robbers, so all the violence was directed towards males only. Sometime during the sequel, two playable female characters were added and female FBI agents were added as enemies, though the latter only appear for one level. The Biker DLC adds a heist where you fight a gang of bikers that are composed of both men and women. The gang member that holds the keycard in day 2 is a female that wears a mask like the players, has a ton of health, and wields a light machine gun, a weapon that is only seen on Skulldozers (Death Wish difficulty) and the Commisar.
</li><li> Female fighters cannot be killed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Samurai Shodown</a> 3</em> and <em>4</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> didn't have female antagonists or mooks for a while until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> introduced Wendy O. Koopa as a boss character. Wendy remained the resident token female enemy for the majority of the series, though the RPG spin offs would put female antagonists more in the spotlight. Admittedly it's hard to tell the gender of most Mario enemies to begin with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> for Wii U</em> has an event match that plays the trope straight. You'll face off against Marth, Peach, and Zelda and you win by defeating Marth. Knocking out Peach or Zelda is an instant failure and the two princesses will always crowd around Marth to make your job that much harder.
</li><li> Averted in <em>Syndicate Wars</em>, the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate">Syndicate</a></em>: While the Unguided and the Church of the New Epoch include plenty of female fighters, Eurocorp agents and guards, as well as the Police, are universally male, barring one or two renegade female Eurocorp agents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider (2013)</a></em> starts out with eight named characters, four white men, one white woman, one Eurasian woman, one black woman, and one Maori guy. Half of these characters die before the game ends, and no, you do not get points for guessing which half. Also, all enemies are men, and the <em>vast</em> majority of them white (there is one black guy as well as a small number of undead Samurai). However, all the villains have actually been browbeaten into serving the malevolent spirit of a <em>female</em> Japanese Empress who wants to transfer her spirit into the body of her descendant for likely malicious reasons, making this an interesting case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a> decreeing men as the expendable gender as she <em>needs</em> a female sacrifice to continue living.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> has female villains, but they are quite rare and only appear as boss characters that advance the plot (Natla in <em>Tomb Raider/Anniversary/Underworld</em>, Sophia Leigh in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em>, Kristina Boaz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheAngelOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheAngelOfDarkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a></em>, and Amanda in <em>Tomb Raider Legend/Underworld</em>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeministFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeministFantasy">All other enemies in the series are men</a> that either advance the plot or serve as nothing more than mooks for Lara to shoot. Compared to the female villains in the series that have somewhat complex motives for their goals (reshape the world in their own image, revenge, etc.), the male villains tend to go for more simple goals, such as taking over the world or gaining power.
</li><li> Near the end of the first episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, the player has to choose between two characters to save from the zombies. They also track player choices. 75% of players chose to save Carly over Doug. Something of a cheat by the developers though: she's the only one with a gun, and the scene is laid out to look like she could save Doug better than the player character can if you toss her a fresh clip, but if you try to save him she will definitely be overrun while you're fighting in close quarters. One of the dialog choices immediately after even lets you state this was your intent.
<ul><li> Inverted in Episode 4: the player has to make a choice between helping Christa or Omid on to the moving train. Omid obviously needs your help more than Christa due to his injured leg, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and even though he manages to get on board even if you help Christa she chews you out for helping her instead of him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> This behavior is encouraged in one of the missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III: Reign of Chaos</em>, called <em>Ravages of the Plague</em>. There you pass through a village that is about to be sacked by bandits. Only one female villager appears there, and she is also the only named villager there — her name is Splendora.

The hyena Digger comes to name Ed is an exile who killed his wife, because it was the only way to protect his child. Having been driven half-mad by the death of her first child at birth (which, while common to hyenas, she thought she was exempt from, since Ed was a surviving firstborn and therefore a living good luck charm), she began to beat first Ed, and then their daughter, at which point Ed realized his wife was never going to get better; so he killed her, in her sleep, to keep her from doing their daughter lasting harm, and then peaceably accepted exile because he knew that what he had done was technically unforgiveable (technically because most of the tribe knew the circumstances and felt he <em>should</em> be forgiven, but his in-laws, lead by his wife's sister, insisted upon exile if not the death sentence). It's worth noting that Digger's hyenas are an aversion in a more general sense as well, because, being based on real hyenas, the gender roles as we know them are reversed (males are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">smaller and physically weaker</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">females</a>, and tend to be the noncoms while women are hunters and warriors).

Most notable when Belkar and the Cleric of Loki fight their way through a massive crowd of thieves, and all of the men are slaughtered while the lone woman gets kissed.

<div class="indent"><em>Female protagonists of modern horror in general push the boundaries in terms of defining the feminine and add a certain emotional touch to the genre that a male protagonist often fails to provide...</em>
</div></li><li> <em>The Mary Sue</em> faces this criticism for their condemning of comics and videogames where female characters are put in harm's way, yet seldom showing outrage when the same happens to a male character. Case in point, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> is considered misogynistic filth due to the treatment of Barbara Gordon, while no mention is made of James Gordon's kidnapping and torture in the same book, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Jason Todd</a>'s ordeal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily">A Death in the Family</a></em>,

One episode it depicted a woman getting shot and slumping over to suggest the chaos had gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">too far</a>. Considering this was interspersed between images of men being decapitated and graphically disemboweled, it was a particularly jarring and perhaps intentional invocation of this trope.
</li><li> Some mild but significant examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>. In the episode "Zuko Alone", we learn that the soldiers lord their power "mostly over women and kids", this small dialogue serving both to damn the soldiers in the audience's eyes as well as gain more sympathy for Zuko and forgive him nearly killing the guy with firebending towards the end. Also, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zuko agrees to an Agni Kai with Azula so "no one else has to get hurt", implying Katara being hurt is worse than him losing and possibly dying (this despite knowing firsthand how competent she is)</span>.

Homer and Marge find that Lisa went with Marge's reporter friend to a feminism convention and go to find her, only to learn that she and the reporter went to an erupting volcano instead.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, OSI strictly forbids the killing of women among its agents as a way to maintain a moral high ground. Brock really doesn't understand this and asks his mentor Hunter if any loopholes exist.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> genre tends to have most villains female, either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstersOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstersOfTheWeek">Monsters of the Week</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a>, or both. Especially noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, where the [MOTWs] are 99% female and end up destroyed (the only male monsters who can't be defeated by being healed are in the Supers season, and even there they're barely a 1% of the monsters used).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> averts this in more ways than one.

In fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HemoErotic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HemoErotic">he seems to enjoy eating women more</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em> he begins to view his minions less as disposable and more as useful (But plentiful) pawns, but doesn't grow out of his sexually motivated diet choices. Later parts confirm that between PB and SC he went eating both men and women to eating exclusively women (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualHarassmentAndRapeTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualHarassmentAndRapeTropes">Among other things...</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is a notable aversion and yet a variation. While men are technically more shown dying than women due to most battles happening on a battlefield (it's a Medieval era drama), if the battle takes place anywhere else or if we're talking about executions, evil-aligned astral beings attacking villages or Apostles rampaging, women are just as likely to die and the author makes it a point to show it to us clearly and on-panel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> R2 has female Knightmare pilots dying, including an entire all-female unit.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, particularly in the Universal Century series, does a good job of keeping significant male and female death rate about the same, contributing to director Yoshiyuki Tomino's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> reputation. Of particular note is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em>'s <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">infamous all-female Shrike Team, that dies off one by one from the moment they're introduced</span>.
<ul><li> It's important to note that while this trope is frequently averted with regards to the main characters (which often have a relatively decent male-to-female ratio on the front lines, making aversions unavoidable) Gundam usually plays it straight otherwise. The vast majority of anonymous extras killed off, be they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt">redshirts</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, are male. Most female deaths are from the main cast and are thus significant and/or tragic. This is a rather bizarre phenomenon when one thinks about it: with there being women in the main cast as members of the Federation/Zeon/Alliance/ZAFT/etc. it would seem that those organizations have no problem allowing women to serve, but when pretty much all the <em>background</em> mobile suit pilots, grunts, and officers are men.

(In other words, men, women, and children all die onscreen, and men and women die at roughly equal frequencies.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Freezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Freezing">Freezing</a></em>, battles with Novas require the involvement of Pandoras and Limiters, who are always female and male respectively. Battles with the Nova always involve insanely high mortality rates for <em>both</em> genders and the death of a Limiter is typically as horrific and emotionally scarring as the death of a Pandora.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> there are the yoma, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">man-eating monsters</a> that disguise themselves as humans. And it is mentioned at the beginning of the story that yoma does not make any difference in the genders when they are hunting for humans.
<ul><li> However, every yoma killed in the course of the act is male. The manga explains that yoma develops because humans are attacked by a type of parasite that mutates their bodies and turns them into cannibals. So every yoma in the anime and manga <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>, at least everyone you see in the story.
</li><li> On the other hand, all half-yoma warriors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">are female</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths">In the first generation of the organization</a> most warriors were male, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility">but men can not handle yoma forces good</a>. Thus, all warriors killed in the succeeding 77 generations, and during the time of the plot, are female.
</li><li> In the anime you see more male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn">Awakened Beings</a> than female, so more male of them are killed. In the manga, on the other hand, there are approximately equal numbers of male and female Awakened Beings, or even slightly more female of them, who are killed.
</li><li> The only arc in which far more men are killed than women is the one in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">a band of robbers</a> ravages the warriorness Teresa.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathRace">Death Race</a></em> averts this numerically, but plays it straight in its use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shots</a> for most female deaths.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> franchise has always been remarkably unbiased about the genders of its xenomorph victims.

One woman gets dragged down a burrow by her crushed legs, another is bisected by a closing emergency door, while another is impaled through the shoulder. The women suffer just as much as the men, and Paul Verhoeven goes into excruciating detail with every kill, making it hard to really find standouts. The only notable female death given any attention is Dizzy, but even then, her death was no cleaner than any other in the film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OlympusHasFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OlympusHasFallen">Olympus Has Fallen</a></em>, there's a couple of female terrorists during the initial attack on the White House.

Especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>, which has both male and female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Resistance pilots</a> fighting and dying onscreen in great numbers as early as the opening battle, which even ends with a female bomber pilot performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to win it. The First Order is a bit more ambiguous due to having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a>, but considering all the female naval personnel seen, and that the leader of the stormtroopers, Captain Phasma, is a woman, it's probably a safe bet that many of those First Order stormtroopers and pilots getting gunned down and shot down onscreen are women as well. (Granted, thus far all but one of the stormtroopers with speaking parts besides Phasma have male voices, but considering the trilogy's willingness to avert this trope this may be more due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial">Men Are Generic, Women Are Special</a>.)

Both Fiona and her mother are killed and Simon lives. The villain's henchmen later debate killing the boy because he saw the dinosaur and decide not to, with Simon's gender never entering their decision-making process. Males and females still die in essentially equal numbers but this incident of the brother surviving and the sister dying in a sibling pair is noteworthy as usually writers will seemingly choose the girl to spare and not the boy.
</li><li> David Weber's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series completely subverts this.

There are women serving in the navies, marines, and armies of Haven, Manticore, and every state except Grayson, plus there are female pirates, merchant crewmembers, thugs, and Havenite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> personnel. The women die as often as the men-which is very frequently, considering that it is a military sci-fi series. In-universe, the conservative Graysons are the only ones who play this straight, but they are gradually moving away from it.
<ul><li> For a long time in their history Graysons had to adopt this strategy as they were teetering on the brink of planetary extinction. They needed babies to survive which required lots of women having lots of babies. Due to a massively unequal sex ration between males and females, they practiced polygamy for the same purpose.
</li><li> A major subversion occurs in "A Short Victorious War." Captain Helen Zilwicki is commanding cruiser escorting a Manticorian convoy that comes under attack by the Havenites. She orders the convoy to scatter and engages the Havenite fleet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">destroying three ships and crippling one before her ship is destroyed.</a> Her husband and four year-old daughter were on one of the ships in the convoy that managed to escape.

The village of Carvahall loses a number of male villagers during the resistance, but only three old women die from cold in the mountains, off-screen and with passing mention of their names. The sole exception to this trope is the elven queen, killed during the final confrontation with the king's forces in the final book.

In addition, while there are more male terrorists and criminals than female ones, the male ones have a much higher chance of surviving: while a good number of male terrorists wind up only captured by the end of a season, even including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or two, female terrorists will <em>always</em> die by the season's end with the only exception being Mandy.

Season 2 rectifies this by not only pretty much eliminating depictions of sexual violence, but also clearly having male and female mooks, both CTAC and regular soldiers, police and criminals, who are frequently fought and killed regardless of gender, with the explicitly all-male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> being an outlier.

That said, the vast majority of the mostly-all-killed-off villains were male. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it's hinted quite often, particularly by Spike in Seasons 2 and 3, that vampire feeding habits are very connected with sexuality. In other words, they kill whatever sort of person they used to be attracted to as humans (male heterosexual vampires would kill women, and so on). As a result, we could expect a relatively mixed vampire population. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the hordes of vampires Buffy kills are male. The female-male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> ratio is generally around 2:5.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> has plenty of female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> to go around. In the first game, female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> seemingly show up randomly and can be anything from snipers to soldiers to biotic commandos. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> still has female enemies but they show up in specific roles, mostly commonly the heavy trooper class, but also as engineers and vanguards. This is likely because it's easier for the game designers to make a class of enemies one particular gender for programming reasons, although in one mission you go up against an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">all-female</a> mercenary army that obviously has female characters fulfilling all roles. Finally, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, the only organic enemies you'll face (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">kind of</a>) are the all-human Cerberus forces, which has two types of enemies that are always female: the Nemesis sniper class and the Phantom biotic class. And of course, allied female characters show up all over the place and are just as readily dispatched as the men by big-honking robots and machine gunners within the first half-hour of each game alone.
<ul><li> Several species in the <em>Mass Effect</em> universe play this straight, however, for entirely practical reasons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Krogan</a> females stay on Tuchanka, their homeworld, and breed with male krogan rather than leave to become mercenaries, but this is because the krogan have been hit by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague">Sterility Plague</a> that makes fertile females astronomically rare, so obviously they can't be thrown into the fray. The salarians also don't have any women in dangerous occupations, but this is because selective breeding habits make only 10% of the entire species female. As a result, the salarians are a matriarchy where the women are "stuck" leading the salarians.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> absolutely averts this with female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> and characters running around in both the enemy and allied forces, even if they're numerically rarer than male enemies. Nonetheless, as far back as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> you could saw a female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a>'s head off with your sword, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> included an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a> street gang that you could potentially end up fighting. The Qunari don't let their women fight, but they're a largely offscreen presence in the games. The only outlier to this otherwise very clear cut aversion is a main mission in the first game where Redcliffe village is under attack by the undead and only the men of the town volunteer to join the militia and fight against them, while the women and children hide in the chantry.

Male cannon fodder enemies still outnumber female ones, but not by a very wide margin. The only human enemy types that don't have female character models are the Arctic Templars and the Illuminati Commandos (the latter may be justified with the possibility of them being cloned).

Due to in- and out-of-universe oddities with how the second generation characters are recruited, it's the father that needs to be present for the story to make sense, so most of the men the player recruits will only be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">permanently wounded</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, whereas any non-plot-crucial female (that is, most of them) will buy the farm for real. Meanwhile, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory">Another Side, Another Story</a> nature of the game means your enemies have the same fairly equal gender ration the player does, and they die in droves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand">God Hand</a></em> also averts this. The only exception is in the first stage as all the enemies are men.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetForceGemini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetForceGemini">Jet Force Gemini</a></em> very quietly averts this. The game's enemies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens">Insectoid Aliens</a> whose gender isn't readily apparent, but multiplayer mode identifies the ant-like soldier drones that make up the lion's share of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> as female. The larger termite-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> are indentified as male, but they're a minority of the enemies encountered, making this an aversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial">Men Are Generic, Women Are Special</a> as well.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUsPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUsPartII">The Last of Us Part II</a></em>, there are about as many female mooks as there are male and Ellie can brutally kill anyone she meets regardless of gender.
</li><li> A subversion or something in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> where the opening cinematic of the first game shows Zoey (a female) telling the rest (males) to go on while she holds off the tank (a big freaking zombie) and she almost dies. Yes, a young, attractive, female character almost heroically sacrificed herself. Then played straight by the second game, we see that Bill (a male) actually DID die defending the rest of the group, although he was the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a></em>. The background of the story, however, hints that the females are much more susceptible to being infected than males, as males apparently possess the gene required to be immune to the virus and then become carriers. This is reflected by the fact that both teams of survivors only had one female in the group. However, you encounter roughly the same amount of females and male common infected in-game. Special Infected, however, are largely lopsided towards the male end of the spectrum, with 2 dedicated female Special Infected and around 5 male Special Infected, and 1 that has both a male and female version. This may be a subversion, however, as Mass Speculation thinks it may be due to certain hormones and chemicals that cause this, rather than it being lazy on the dev part (or both).
</li><li> The Luminoth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> has both their men and women being slaughtered by the Ing during the war before the start of the game. As you progress, the game isn't afraid of showing you many dead Luminoth peppered throughout every region and scanning some of them shows how both male and female Luminoth met their end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> averts this among the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">mons</a>. Among Pokémon, gender (or lack thereof) will not save you from a fight. The move Attract (which creates a failure chance on an opposite-gender Pokémon) can be learned as easily by males whose species can learn it as by the females. Further, the gender of human characters is completely irrelevant to any battle mechanic, with the only consideration being how good a trainer you are. The only difference is that characters will often have Pokémon matching their gender.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em> all the rival gangs are destroyed completely except for 2 important male characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Benjemin King and Donny</span> while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tanya Winters and Lin, 2 of the <em>only</em> 3 important female gang members (Aisha never actually joined the Saints) both die by the end of the game</span>.
<ul><li> Also averted numerically: enemies (whether gang members or police officers) are just as likely to be female as male (indeed, sometimes it seems most of the cops are female) and the game never makes a big deal out of it.
</li><li> DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> allows boss and a female supporting character to kill literally dozens of Space Amazons with laser weapons. The whole thing is just the setting of a movie, but the weapons are all shown to be quite lethal and if boss is a woman herself, then the whole thing is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">Fight</a> with no men even being seen. Still not convinced? There are <em>two</em> achievements for killing 35 Amazons with one of the ray guns and another for beating 7 to death with melee attacks! <em>Saints Row</em> may be a lot of things, but it <em>does not</em> discriminate against its characters.
<ul><li> The main game also had a mission called "Trojan Whores" where one of the Saints' cribs is attacked by an army of "hooker assassins" hired by the DeWinter sisters. By the end of the mission, all of them are dead and many lonely men are left without company for the evening.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> While the mooks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Star Wars: Battle for Naboo</a></em> are genderless droids for the majority of the game, the eleventh mission pits the player against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Borvo the Hutt</span>'s private fleet of mercenary fighters, whose pilots have a roughly even male/female ratio. The kicker? The only indication of the pilots' genders is from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">the screams they make over the radio as you shoot them down, one by one...</a>
<ul><li> On the good guys' side, there are also female pilots in the Royal Naboo Airforce who are just as in danger of getting shot down in-game as the males.
</li></ul></li><li> Among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">crowds of people that try to kick your ass</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a></em> are a surprising amount of women.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefTheDarkProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefTheDarkProject">Thief: The Dark Project</a></em> had only male enemies, but its sequel went out of its way to avert this; nearly half of all guards, police, enemy zealot Mechanists or others were female.
</li><li> Depending on the level you're playing, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters">TimeSplitters</a></em> franchise pits the player against both male and female enemies. While a lot of environments, especially in Future Perfect, feature a pretty even split between genders (for example, you face both male and female security guards in the U-Genix levels), others have you exclusively fighting just one gender (you fight only male outlaws in the Wild West and an all-female hacker gang in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeoTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeoTokyo">Neo Tokyo</a> in TS 2). This actually makes considerable sense since you spend every game jumping to different time periods; of course, your enemy set would vary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> has monsters and boss monsters in both genders and can be killed all in the same way if you choose to go for the violent route.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> partially averts this. While the Corpus seem to deploy only men onto the battlefield (backed by a variety of cyborg and robot units), the Grineer have a number of female combatants- primarily either harpoon-throwing assassins or highly-armored heavy gunners. Given that the Grineer are a bunch of degenerate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneArmy">clones</a>, most of whom are extremely violent and have a natural lifespan of less than a decade, it's possible that both of their genders have no actual role in reproduction and women are considered just as expendable as men. As for the Tenno... while the Warframes themselves have gender-specific physiques and are called "him" or "her" in their in-game descriptions, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the fact that they are manufactured shells psionically-controlled by Operators may preclude them actually being able to reproduce</span>.
<ul><li> Overall Zig-Zagged as on one hand, all Grineer women experience mandatory military service and are locked out of scientific and scholarly efforts, due to the stigma that such actions are considered beneath them. The Grineer as a society is a matriarchy, lead by twin queens, and although the women are required to serve, they are simultaneously given greater assistance through various augments, even when in lower rankings, while the men are generally left to fend for themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> is noteworthy even in comparison to other games in its franchise in that while XCOM has always been able to recruit female operatives and troops, XCOM 2 has them fighting on <em>both</em> sides of the conflict. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">ADVENT Coalition</a> Peacekeepers can also be either male or female, which only becomes even more remarkable <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with the revelation that ADVENT's forces are essentially a clone army of artificially created alien/human hybrids, meaning ADVENT is deliberately manufacturing both male and female soldiers</span>. More than that, the game even features a handful of female alien units, specifically the Vipers and the Berserkers.
</li><li> Almost all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XIII">XIII</a></em> has the player gunning down male soldiers/mercenaries/security guards etc. However, there's a select few levels in the last third of the game in which both male and female bodyguards are fought and killed without any hesitation by the protagonist. An innocent female lifeguard also suffers a particularly graphic death in the game's second level.

The egalitarian Horde is presented as the epitome of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil">Equal-Opportunity Evil</a>, both in-universe and out, having plenty of female members in all ranks.

<ul><li> Season 1 combines both numerical and gorn aversions since Dracula wants to kill <em>all humans</em>. The show is all too eager to show the violent deaths of men, women, children or <em>literal infants</em>.
</li><li> Played straight and justified in one scene of Season 2 where Dracula goes after a group of (all male) traders who "wronged" him. He wasn't targeting their wives and children, (who were already long gone by the time he found them), or any of the other inhabitants of the town for that matter, just them. However he isn't depicted as any less evil for sparing them, just more petty. Imagine watching your entire village burn down and seeing the corpses of countless men, including your husband/father impaled on sticks just so you would see it.
</li><li> Also averted during the battle in the penultimate episode of Season 2, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all of Dracula's surviving vampire soldiers and generals are killed by the heroes</span>, male and female alike, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsToATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsToATeam">there are only two of the latter</a>.

</li><li> The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte">Parasyte</a></em> shows parasites that take over human bodies, only to subsequently kill and eat other people. The parasites do not distinguish between the genders and eat both men and women. In fact, among the victims, whether they are parasites or humans, are about the same number of men as women (the parasites are actually sexless, they only take on different male and female bodies). In the course of the plot, the hero's mother is killed, while his father survives the attack. And the first victim killed at the beginning of the anime is a woman.
<ul><li> The real-life movie drives it even more to the extreme. A parasite kills fourteen girls at a school, but not a single boy.

Cosmo's death is long, tragic and beautiful; Molly's not so much, perhaps because she's only in one episode while Cosmo is a character throughout the third series. Of course, if you watch the 4Kids English dubs you'll walk away thinking they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">were just Put On A Bus or something</a>.

Among the defenders are an all-female unit with an extremely risky role: they jump off the wall, with ropes attached to metal rings around their waists, to attack the monsters at close range and then get pulled back up. One of these women is grabbed and pulled down by the monsters and her bloodstained metal ring, the only thing left, is pulled up and tossed onto a pile of similar rings.
</li><li> The 2015 Russian film "Battalion" tells a very fictionalized story of the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death that averts, subverts, and plays straight this trope. After the fall of the Tsar, the new Russian government recruits female soldiers. The male soldiers who have been fighting on the front for three years are demoralized and in many cases refuse to fight. The generals and the new government leaders agree to recruit women and send them to the front lines, with the expectation that this will shame the soldiers and encourage them to fight. The women are sent to the front lines and find that the men have no interest in fighting because they believe the war will be over soon and they just want to go home. The women fight in three battles. In the final battle they end up getting trapped in their reserve trench and the male soldiers get convinced to aid them and charge into battle to rescue them. (In real life, the women overran all three German trenches, but had to withdraw when they didn't get any reinforcements.)
<ul><li> There are also numerical and gorn averions here. During the battle scenes, the Germans gas, shoot, choke, beat, and stab a lot of women. All of these deaths are depicted very graphically.

For Lucia Márquez, it's because she intended to wipe out the Taino people including a woman who was very likely her own half-sister (not that either knew) as revenge for the (probably deserved) death of her father. And in Jing Lang's case, she and feigned a romantic relationship with Assassin in an attempt to get information of a treasure cache and played to both brothers' paranoia so that they killed one another.

<ul><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, again.
<ul><li> Casca is considered less expendable than the rest of the Hawks during the Eclipse but not because she's female, but because she is in charge in the absence of Griffith.
</li><li> More literally, during the Conviction's Arc, Nina's cowardly and indecisive behavior in the face of imminent danger, even though she wasn't a main character or anything. Her failure at being useful to the group she was tagging along with (which included a child, Isidro, and a retarded thus <em>truly</em> helpless woman, Casca) and trying to avoid putting herself on the line for everyone's welfare was met with unanimous disapproval.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfMotherSarah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfMotherSarah">The Legend of Mother Sarah</a></em> is an aversion in that, even though it's a woman-centered story, it doesn't treat female death (which happens quite a lot) as something to be grieved over more than male death. If anything, women just get no special treatment for being women.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>.
<ul><li> Dio Brando and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">the Pillar men</a> view their male vampire minions as disposable props to achieve their goals, frequently killing them for the slightest infractions and absorbing them to rejuvenate themselves. Although they're less picky when it comes to their enemies and victims.
</li><li> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PhantomBlood">Phantom Blood</a></em>, though Dio cares little for most of his male allies, he often consumes men and women who are against him. In fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HemoErotic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HemoErotic">he seems to enjoy eating women more</a>. He begins to view his minions less as disposable and more as useful (But plentiful) pawns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, but doesn't grow out of his sexually motivated diet choices.
</li><li> The Pillar men in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleTendency">Battle Tendency</a></em> straight up find it distasteful to harm women. Most of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> victims happen to be male and they appear to avoid harming women because of this. Although Esidisi and Kars didn't seem to have a problem latching his brain onto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzie Q</span> and risking her getting killed to outsmart Joseph and Caesar, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brutally stabbing Lisa Lisa in the back after tricking her into attacking a body double</span> respectively.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder43');">    Films  Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder43" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich">Munich</a></em>, the Israeli assassins kill a Dutch woman who killed one of their co-workers. Although they retain audience sympathy or at least remain morally ambivalent, that assassination is also portrayed as more noteworthy than the assassinations of numerous male characters and the only assassination that was questioned in-movie, which is especially interesting as she is an amoral hitwoman working for pay and thus arguably morally <em>worse</em> than the ideologically motivated Black September members that make up the other victims.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em> Hooker begins a relationship with a waitress who (unknown to him and the audience) is actually an assassin contracted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob">The Irish Mob</a> to kill him. She is killed before she can do it by a bodyguard hired by Gondorff. The moment itself is shocking, but there is no angst or condemnation about it - she might as well have been a male hitman.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromParisWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromParisWithLove">From Paris with Love</a></em> features a lot more in the way of the heroes killing male mooks, Wax has no trouble shooting and killing a female terrorist and isn't demonised for it. Reese <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is eventually forced to shoot his fiancee Caroline when she is threatening to trigger a suicide bomb and while he hesitates and it's obviously sad it's presented as absolutely the right thing to do</span>.
</li><li> Walter shoots, Phyllis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleIndemnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleIndemnity">Double Indemnity</a>,</em> disgusted at her manipulation of him, shortly before dying himself. Despite the fact that he did all the actual killing and most of the cover-up, the film makes sure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">depict Phyllis as a shady lady right from the beginning</a> and thus make her look like an evil manipulator and Walter look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">helpless schmuck.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Red" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Red">Red</a></em> has two villainous female characters: a rocket launcher carrying hitwoman and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cooper's boss CIA agent Cynthia Wilkes who is eventually revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a></span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Both are killed by <em>male</em> good guys without pause or comment regarding their gender.</span>
</li><li> While many modern action films have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a> (who may or may not be killed) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em> is unusual in having plenty of female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> in the ranks of the villain's organization who get killed off with as little fanfare as their male counterparts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DjangoUnchained" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DjangoUnchained">Django Unchained</a></em> has a female bounty hunter getting shot without any more focus than the other male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> in the same scene, and Django <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots Laura Candi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">across the room</a> without any hesitation</span>. Should be no surprise coming from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>: Miranda/Talia is the main villain and nobody sheds a tear for her when she dies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HaloNightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HaloNightfall">Halo: Nightfall</a></em> averts this. Once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Condor crashes</span> and "lifeboat rules" are brought up when the protagonists realize <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only two people will be getting off the Alpha Shard alive</span>, no one mentions making sure the two female soldiers on the team - Wisner and Macer - are the ones to go. Instead, they all agree to draw straws to decide who makes it out alive once their mission is complete. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or that how it would have gone if everyone didn't start to betray one another until it's only Locke, Aiken, <em>and</em> Macer who end up drawing straws in the end</span>.
<ul><li> The straw drawing scene is more of a subversion than a clear cut aversion. During the final scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Locke, Aiken, and Macer</span> draw straws, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Macer is initially left out of the drawing not because she's a woman, but because she's the youngest one in the group, and both Locke and Aiken have something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWish">Death Wish</a> at this point. She demands being let in on it though, so she draws with Aiken and Locke and ends up getting to leave the Alpha Shard with Locke</span>. Subverted <em>again</em> when it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aiken rigged the drawing so that he would be the one to stay behind and ensure their survival</span>.
</li><li> Also, the first character to die after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Condor crash is Wisner, who is killed off in a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn-y</a> death. Her death is mourned by the team, but not any more so than any of the other characters once they start dying and before everyone starts backstabbing each other</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The few female criminals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick">John Wick</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2">John Wick: Chapter 2</a></em> are portrayed as being just as dangerous and bloodthirsty as their numerically much more common male counterparts. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2">John Wick: Chapter 2</a></em> John faces off against two female hitwomen whom he just as brutally dispatches as the other enemies in the film.
