However, there is one group of bisexuals who seem all too well represented in the mainstream: the cold-blooded murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopaths</a>.
</p><p>This is a very different phenomenon from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> trope. Whereas the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">violent or deranged</a> out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">unrequited love</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealousy</a>, the typical Depraved Bisexual is bi because, well, why not? Their willingness to sleep with everyone they can is just one facet of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Craziness</a> — i.e. they don't consider certain relationships taboo, because they don't consider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">anything</a></em> taboo. A slightly less pathological version of the trope depicts the Depraved Bisexual as "simply" supremely manipulative; recognizing the effectiveness of sex as a control mechanism, they resort to it at every opportunity — reasoning that successful seductions gain new thralls, while even unsuccessful ones tend to increase others' fear of you. Male instances are disproportionately likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SissyVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SissyVillain">Sissy Villains</a>, but not as often as you might think.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Interestingly enough, though, many if not most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesbianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesbianVampire">Lesbian Vampires</a> are in fact bisexual. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a>, you know.
</p><p>More common in film than on TV, where LGBT+ folk of any sort, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">especially bisexuals</a>, were originally a rarity (this changed over time). Of the TV instances, several are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">duplicates</a>, to show just <em>how</em> evil and different they are from the originals. At one time this was practically the only way an explicitly bisexual character could appear in any film, anywhere; in his book <em>Bisexual Characters in Film</em>, Wayne Bryant is able to fill a whole chapter of examples of this, as well as another book about bisexual murder victims. In more pleasant examples, bisexual characters simply don't follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation">Cast Speciation</a> as much as a solidly gay character does and are less likely to be used. An exception is in a mystery plot, where a potential ex-lover being a suspect suddenly becomes much harder to pin down.

Also, his "first love" was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">sister</a>.

Also, in the light novels, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he falls in love with Huey's homunculus, Sickle.</span> There's also his offhand comments about other men's attractiveness ("Firo, or whatever his name was Who could have expected such a cute face to ever be capable of such horrifying cruelty?")
<ul><li> Also, Ladd Russo himself. In the game, you can make him marry Claire, but he still admits that he still loves Lua, but not as much as Claire.

<ul><li> He mostly seems to be of the manipulative variety, seeing as he only had sex in order to take advantage of someone.
<ul><li> Then again, that's what makes Griffith so ambiguous. Even though we know that Griffith <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> screwed Princess Charlotte just to make himself feel better after Guts left</span>, he might very well have some unrequited feelings for both Guts <em>and</em> Casca, judging from the fact that a) he was a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> when it came to Guts, through and through and thought about him while having sex with Charlotte, b) before activating his crimson behelit a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, Griffith did have a vision of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he and Casca sharing a quiet, peaceful life together, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">child and all</a></span> and to top it off, c) he gave Guts and Casca the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare">Kubrick Stare</a> when it was evident that they had become a couple.

Her affections are not just limited to Sebastian; in general, she loves to flirt with anyone that takes her fancy so long as they are good looking, badass, and sadistic enough. For example, with William Spears <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the Undertaker</span>, she seems enamored by William's way of directing violence towards her and asks Undertaker to "make love with me" after she sees his pretty eyes. She also expresses attraction towards Pluto, both when he's in his human male form and dog form, Agni (in the Hamlet OVA), and Kirito (in the first musical). She even gets too close for comfort to Alois at one point and looked like she meant to seduce him. She initially fell in love with Madame Red due to her way of killing prostitutes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later killed her when she thought she was going soft by refusing to kill Ciel</span>, and once commented that she thought Alois's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Ninja Maid</a> Hannah Anafeloz had a cute/pretty face — before stabbing her.
</li><li> Lord Aleister Chamber is hinted to be this. He proved himself to be a crazy bastard with every appearance, flirts heavily with the ladies only to try to sell them into sexual slavery, is involved with a plot of turning humans into zombies, and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> towards Elizabeth's female friend. He also flirts with Ciel both when he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag">Disguised in Drag</a> and when he's dressed normally and acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> to him, comments fondly on other boys good looks, (Alois, Joanne, and Ciel) as well as getting turned on when he sees Edward's face in the behind the scenes episode.
</li><li> Sebastian could qualify, being an amoral demon who finds pleasure in the idea of getting to eat Ciels soul and acts almost like a low key sexual predator in regards to Ciel due to that. Attempts to eat Ciels soul and his relationship with Ciel in general is painted in an ominous romantic light. He also has slept with women for information, in one instance coercing a woman into sexual activities in a dubious scene.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Alois Trancy</a> in season 2. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">alternates</a> between being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, depressed, terrified, sweet, and cheerful, flirts with Sebastian via leaning into him and pronouncing that he "smells good", fanboys him intensively, and is jealous of his devotion to Ciel, is <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">attached</a> to his butler Claude, treats his one female maidservant Hannah like absolute crap (he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">stabs out her eye with his fingers</a> just for looking at him and later mocks her for it), dresses and acts very effeminately and flamboyantly and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">girlish face</a>, cross-dresses and flirts with Ciel in the fifth episode and outright tells Ciel that he "wants" him and that he'll kill all his loved ones unless Ciel becomes "his". Also, in episode 8 Alois practically confesses to Claude and in episode 11, Alois tells Claude "Claude, you ensnared my heart in a spider web, my eternal Highness. I wanted your love". He also is jealous of Claude's attachment to Ciel and abuses Ciel's body that his soul resides in at one point because of it, threatening to commit suicide while in Ciel's body because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithRejection">Not Good with Rejection</a>. In "Spider's Intentions" there's a scene where he compares Claude to a butterfly in his mind and yearns to keep Claude by his side even if he has to clip off his wings. In a fit of insanity in the short, he also sets a fire in a room. In episode 8 Alois <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay">expertly seduces the old man Lord Trancy</a> suggesting he's not a virgin and that he might have experience soliciting himself for money before being taken in by Lord Trancy. In regards to the ladies, he's willing to share a dance with Elizabeth, Ciel's fiance, in order to spite Ciel, and confessed he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyCravesAffection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyCravesAffection">Desperately Craves Affection</a> from anyone, including Hannah, despite his abuse of her. The huge attraction he has toward men and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">No Sense of Personal Space</a> he has in regards to anyone in particular is implied to be because of loneliness, attachment and abandonment issues stemming from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> where he found his only remaining family member (his brother) dead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeLeadsToInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeLeadsToInsanity">Rape Leads to Insanity</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndSwitch">Rape and Switch</a>, which perhaps affected him in a promiscuous sense and twisted his concept of sex and romance overall.
</li><li> Azzurro is a mob leader who shows interest in Ciel and grabs Ciel's face in episode 2, saying they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> and telling him "Let's get along" after kidnapping him. It's implied he might've tried to molest Ciel had Sebastian not come to his rescue and he also beat him up when he said something that angered him. His attraction to women seems to come into play when Sebastian is threatening him and Azzurro offers him anything he wants, money or women, if he'll spare him, implying that he likes and has no shortage of either.
</li><li> In the Spiders Intention OVA, the Trancy triplet named Timber pervertedly comments that he'd "be willing to" love Alois for how heated, passionate, and unstable he can be and also finds him to be cute when he cries implying he has affection for him. He also lusts after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> Hannah with the other triplets. In terms of depravity, he comments with his brothers that if it weren't for Hannah living in the mansion he would burn down the place in a heartbeat.
</li><li> Then there's Baron Kelvin's obsession with Ciel which also counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> considering the fact that Baron Kelvin is an old, ugly, fat psycho and Ciel is a beautiful little 12-year-old. Also, he apparently fell in love with Ciel when he first saw him at age 7 and is keenly aware that Ciel is beautiful while he is not. He becomes determined to get surgery and change his appearance, hoping to "become beautiful" and therefore worthy of Ciel, since he believes that "only special people can touch other special people" and desires to touch him sexually. He also comments on Ciel's father's beautiful looks and doesn't care at all when his wife divorces him because of her disgust towards his unsavory actions. He tries entertaining Ciel with a show of mind-wiped circus kids where they die gruesomely to Kelvin's utter delight. He wanted to recreate the moment when Ciel was captured with the other children and tortured by the cultists. Did we mention his way of becoming beautiful to suit Ciel involved using parts from children to make himself a new body and even had his legs amputated for this purpose?
</li><li> Ciel's twin brother, the real Ciel is a yandere at almost incestuous levels. Even as a child, "Ciel" hated being separated from his brother; he actually cried when Ciel said he wanted to move to London to work at a toy shop. When Undertaker resurrects him as a Bizarre Doll, "Ciel" declares that he will never leave Ciel's side ever again. And indeed he clung desperately to life during the revival process, tunnel visioning on seeing his beloved brother again. He has taken Ciels place at the mansion and gotten Ciel framed and arrested, taking his fiancé Elizabeth as his own.

Given that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Revy</a> it's hard to tell if this is real or an invocation of this trope as a threat.

He doesn't care <em>what</em> gender his victims are, so long as he can get his kicks from them.

In earlier chapters, he outright explains that he always needs <em>someone</em> to keep "the part down there" happy, and then when his arm is cut off and he can no longer visit brothels he kidnaps a young boy, forces him to take care of him, and rapes him.

Genma's primary interest seems to be for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">young boys</a>, but he makes perverted comments implying that he's open to anything. He also has a highly sadistic streak <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and reveals casually that he was the one who killed his perky human partner, Yoko, and she was clearly tortured to death</span>.

Although whether he's 'just' being supremely manipulative and hypersexual, or it's just all part of one great squirming Scalpel Crazy package, kind of fluctuates depending on where you are in the plot and whether it's the anime or manga because... the writer is unreliable. About everything. Seriously.

</li><li> After Erika discovers Anri is the wielder of Saika, she wastes no time in groping Anri and feeling all over her body to find that sword, all while Anri laughs because she's ticklish. Kadota ends up restraining her. Moreover, when Anri first tries to spill the beans about Saika, Erika assumes that she's trying to blurt out a "yuri confession" and she admits to liking both boys and girls. And later she fantasises about becoming Anri's familiar if Anri were to stab her with Saika. She also has a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">gush over guy love</a> and has "hobbies" which includes acting out manga torture scenes.
</li><li> Izaya is hinted to be interested in girls when he tells a girl who tries to kill him that he loves her and wants to become her boyfriend. He also "loves humanity" and has a mutual fascination with Mikado whom he calls "cute" and "humanity itself".

Kalinin describes him as "dissolute and given up to hedonism", which is a nice way of saying "depraved" or "lax in morals".

He says this with a perfect mixture of "coldness and joy," and she responds by gasping with "pain and ecstasy."
</li><li> In the novels, being the sick pervert he is, he shows interest in humiliating and possibly molesting/raping Tessa (to "break" her spirit, since he's annoyed with "righteous" people). He makes it very clear to the other submarine personnel that if they try to do anything, he ''will' do "X-rated" things to the cute captain. When she acts defiant toward him, it "pleased him from the bottom of his heart," and he exclaims "Ohhh, she's cute!" and proceeds to jokingly ask the Mithril traitors if they're sure they want to leave since this place seems like a nice place to work.

Soon after this incident, Masao kills Aoki. While Masao admits to having a crush on Rei, he also says that he has a crush on Kira, who he sees as an obstacle in getting to Rei. His personality and mind are very much twisted, and he stalks and attempts to kill both Rei and Kira in the series.

</li><li> Tomomi Harukawa from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonlightLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonlightLady">Moonlight Lady</a></em> is this trope: she practically <em>drags</em> the protagonist Suzuna and her young cousin Io into the sack (never at the same time).

</li><li> Michio Yuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MW">MW</a></em>. Yuki is a social climber, infiltrating the worlds of finance and politics by day while brutally murdering and raping people (mostly women) by night—perversely using his Kabuki-honed skills as a female impersonator to pass himself off as the women he's killed. His drive, however, will not be satiated with a promotion here and a rape there. Michio Yuki has a far more ominous objective: obtaining MW, the ultimate weapon that spared his life but robbed him of all conscience. There is only a few men with the capacity to stop him: a tormented Catholic priest, Iwao Garai, who shares Yuki's past—and frequently his bed as his lover in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindGameShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindGameShip">Mind Game Ship</a> dynamic they have.

He also kind of has grown to love Ada and flirts with Lotti (both female). He initially states he hates women especially when they try to get close to his brother, calls them "insects" that he tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">"remove"</a>, and prior to falling for Ada, he had the intention of wanting to "taint" her.

</li><li> Jouji "George" Koizumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadiseKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadiseKiss">Paradise Kiss</a></em> is extremely debatable. It depends on whether you see him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, or a plain old self-centered, vain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> with no heart whatsoever. Either way, he's openly bisexual, <em>very</em> kinky, and very vocal about his love of bondage. Even though it's never implied his bisexuality is related in any way to it, he's clearly fucked in the head and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">a ton of issues</a>.

He also appears to have an interest in guys. For example, his reason for following Miroku is because "you're better looking than me". He's also hesitant in fighting Shao because it would "be a waste to kill such a good looking guy". He's also pretty unstable and considers his power Zone Diver which has some pretty heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> in it. He can phase through objects, including people's skin. Imagine a hand going through your chest, and then grabbing your heart. Or pulling your bones out one by one. Or dragging you into the ground, and fusing you with the cement.

It's shown in Zan that for the sake of the principle of being open-minded, he had a one night stand with a butch blonde transgender gigolo (who looked like an unshaven twin of GTO in a dress) in a love hotel and hated it (he was filled with despair while they were doing it).

In the novels, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he hits on Crowley, talks about wanting to buy a prostitute, and is depicted as having beautiful young girls and boys wearing revealing clothing while serving him which Crowley derides as lewd.</span> He hits on Mika to the point of touching his butt in one scene and threatens to tear his clothes off and molest him, albeit jokingly. He also primarily gets enjoyment out of ruining people's lives (doing things like maiming them before killing them). He shows interest in Yuu as well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TermsOfEndangerment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TermsOfEndangerment">calling him cutesy nicknames</a>, blushing when he cries and saying he thinks he knows why Mika is so attached to Yuu.

Then there's chapter 46 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where he calls Yuu cute, grabs his face to look into his eyes, rubs his lips with his thumb, appearing like he means to kiss him, and finally gets to bite him like he always wanted. He also reveals how he kept Yuu and Mika's deceased family's (Akane) decapitated head and Narumi's deceased friends' bodies</span>. The fanbook also states his greatest fantasy as him wanting to suck Guren's blood in front of Guren's squad. Given that vampires are unable to feel sexual pleasure it's implied he is able to lust for blood and wants to do it because he's a sadist and drinking blood feels good for both parties involved. He also has a great attachment to his father Saito, to the point of extreme daddy issues, and wanting to steal his attention for himself.
<ul><li> Chess feels a great attachment to her master Crowley, blushes when drinking his blood and fights with Horn over his attention, and accepts treats from him around Valentine's day.

He initially doesn't care about or even think twice about Inugami... until he pushes Inugami too far. Which results in Inugami showing him his true form and scaring the shit out of Haguro. Haguro goes insane from it, and obsesses and stalks Inugami after that, even cutting himself all over his arm and carving the word "Inu" onto his hand. And yes, it's creepy to the point of being something of a sexual obsession as well — Haguro has been shown after that too, while having sex with his (equally crazy) girlfriend (who, by the way, also lusts after Inugami and thinks about him while having sex with Haguro), think only about Inugami, and screams his name while imagining him. And later Haguro decides to up his freakiness by beating up his subordinate Chiba, kissing him, taking the opportunity to tear out his tongue, defecate on him, and then rape him. All because Chiba happened to run into Inugami in the street earlier and talked to him when Haguro wasn't around. And he also tortures and rapes a female teacher named Aoshika (who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent">in love with Inugami</a> <em>and</em> is the guy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a>) while recording it so that Inugami can see, practically talking to the camera (and, therefore, to Inugami) through the entire thing so that Inugami will come back to him.

<ul><li> It becomes downright canon when it gets spelled out that Haguro felt "love at first sight" when he saw Akira. He then becomes obsessed to "become one" with him to the point he throws himself onto his own sword just to be able to hold Akira.

And now that's taken on his father's mantle in the <em>Dark Wolverine</em> series, Daken appears determined to sleep his way through the Dark Avengers team. It helps that he has <strike>sex-pollen</strike> pheromone powers that affect everybody differently. Venom/Mac Gargan has "strange feelings" for Daken.

His relationship with victim/chronicler/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlySidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlySidekick">Cowardly Sidekick</a> Bunny is possibly a <em>very</em> close friendship, but is speculated by fans and critics alike to be a gay romance (especially since Raffles was based partly on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a> and partly on LGBT activist George Ives). The way Raffles is shown relating to Bunny is fairly exploitative and emotionally abusive. Hornung was frustrated that his readers insisted on seeing Raffles as glamorous anyhow; his later stories, where he portrayed Raffles more brutally, were less popular. More recent takes on Raffles invariably go the Robin Hood, detective, or other hero route.

</li><li> The necromancer-villain of Deborah Turner Harris's <em>Mages of Garillon</em> series, Borthen Berigeld, almost certainly physically as well as morally seduced a secondary antagonist character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mage-Inquisitor Earlis ap Eadric</span> into his service; though it's never explicitly confirmed, the character's behaviour—even to the point of turning upon Berigeld when he sees the necromancer later bedding a woman — is note-perfectly that of a mesmerized and then betrayed lover.
</li><li> Characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BretEastonEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BretEastonEllis">Bret Easton Ellis</a> novels. A huge number of his characters are casually bisexual males from different ends of the spectrum, and almost all of his characters are completely morally depraved and shallow. This is most notable in <em>The Informers</em> where every male would appear to be a shallow, blonde, Californian bisexual boy toy who is possibly a vampire. However, some notable exceptions are Paul in <em>The Rules of Attraction</em>, Clay in <em>Less Than Zero</em> and Victor in <em>Glamorama</em>—all different sorts of bisexuals, and flawed as characters in several ways, but ultimately the heroes of their stories in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">shallow little universe.</a>

<ul><li> In-universe, Oberyn Martell is <em>viewed</em> as one by most of the other nobles of Westeros. He has a <em>lot</em> of bastards, is often said to have sex with men, and is not looked on favorably for his crippling of the heir to Highgarden at a tourney years ago, and his penchant for fighting with poisoned weapons. Also his long-term paramour — basically his wife, except they're not married — is a bastard daughter, which makes her a completely unfit consort for the brother of a great lord in the eyes of the rest of Westeros. It's hard to say Oberyn actually evil or crazy, though, and the judgment of his sexuality is largely a cultural clash between the looser Dornish and the more judgmental northern Westerosi.
</li><li> By the time of <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>, Daenerys Targaryen has received this reputation of Depraved Omnisexual in Volantis and Slaver's Bay, courtesy of the many wild-running rumors about her.
</li><li> Rorge loves to rape little girls and threatened to rape Arya when he thought she was a boy.
</li></ul></li><li> The villain of Joan D. Vinge's <em>Psion</em>.
</li><li> Kavinsky in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenCycle">The Dream Thieves</a></em> is heavily implied to be this. He deals drugs, steals, street races, and that's not even getting into the kidnapping, blackmail, and attempted murder. He's been known as a user and abuser when it comes to women, but he also has positively <em>massive</em> amounts of Foe Yay with Ronan. Whenever he's not fighting or goading Ronan, he's flirting with him.
</li><li> Max Aue from Jonathan Littell's <em>The Kindly Ones</em> is a homicidal sociopath (as well as a SS officer who took part in the Holocaust). As an added bonus, his preferences are the result of his obsessive love/lust for his twin sister.
</li><li> There's a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">A Nightmare on Elm Street: Suffer The Children</a></em> that's quite disturbing.

</li><li> Mitsuko in Jun'ichiro Tanizaki's novel <em>Manji</em> (or <em>Quicksand</em>), a chilling sexual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> despite her tender age. With the help of a small-time ruffian (which she also sleeps with), she plays victim and manipulates the emotions of housewife Sonoko, and then, having also seduced Sonoko's husband, drives the couple into reciprocal suspicion. She reaps the benefit of their emotional wreckage, gains total control over their sex life, plus their adoration befitting a goddess.
</li><li> Peter Quint in Henry James's novella <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnOfTheScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnOfTheScrew">The Turn of the Screw</a></em> is usually interpreted as such, and a pedophile to boot — but that depends on how you take the veiled hints and Victorian euphemisms. Benjamin Britten's operatic adaptation makes things slightly more explicit, especially with the sensual call-and-response duet between Quint and Miles at the end of Act 1.
</li><li> Oddly, it seems every other character in Lloyd Rose's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Doctor Who novels</a> is this. There are at least two villains who gently caress the Doctor while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">doing bad things to him</a>, and the Doctor seems to have a bit of fun with this trope himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">flirting with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> Sabbath and turning his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">No Sense of Personal Space</a> act <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

</li><li> Mrs. Jewkes from Samuel Richardson's <em>Pamela</em>:
<div class="indent">Every now and then she would be staring in my face, in the chariot, and squeezing my hand, and saying, Why, you are very pretty, my silent dear! And once she offered to kiss me. But I said, I don't like this sort of carriage, Mrs. Jewkes; it is not like two persons of one sex. She fell a laughing very confidently, and said, That's prettily said, I vow! Then thou hadst rather be kissed by the other sex? 'Ifackins, I commend thee for that!

She is utterly evil and sadistic. Then again, everyone in Terre D'Ange is bi, so there was bound to be some evil people thrown in the mix. Aversions: Phedre, Alcuin, and Delaunay.

You can't just say 'no, I'd rather sit down and read a book' when they bring on the Libyan eunuchs crawling around on all fours in tigerskins!"
</li><li> In S. M. Stirling's <em>Shadowspawn</em> series the entire titular race is this.
</li><li> Elphaba from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked">Wicked</a></em> may count. She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>, though whether she's "evil" or not is a major point in the series. She's had a sexual relationship with a man <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where she conceived a son</span> but also is confirmed to have more than platonic feelings with her friend Glinda.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a>'s <em>Songmaster</em> includes a major character named Josif who is introduced as homosexual, enters a heterosexual relationship with the statement that he is '60% attracted to men, 38% attracted to women, and 2% attracted to sheep,' and ends his sexual career unable to control his urges toward a barely pubescent child, making him at least a homosexual hebephile. No meaningful counterexamples exist in the setting, in part because most of the book centers around pederasty.

</li><li> Patrick Hocksetter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT">IT</a></em>. He fondles the girls in his class, masturbates Henry, and offers him oral sex.
</li><li> Luce Daggett, the villain of Colleen McCullough's <em>Indecent Obsession</em>. His backstory is as a gigolo who serviced both men and women regardless of his own preferences and is used as an example of his manipulative nature, but his bisexuality is also genuine and shown as part of his evil in itself, as he's an omnivorous sexual threat. His explanation to the heroine of why he's hitting on her when he hit on another man a few days ago is "young, old, male, female—it's all meat to me", which causes her to react with "revulsion" and tell him that he's damned. His final confrontation against Michael is also charged with sexual violence. In contrast, the homosexual characters in the book are portrayed as ranging from good to saintly.
</li><li> Lisbeth Salander from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy">The Millennium Trilogy</a></em> is a rare sympathetic example, being simultaneously bisexual, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a>, and awesome.

He kills without a care and is known to torture, beat, and rape people for not giving him what he wants. His lovers can't even be mentioned in polite company half the time.

</li><li> Russian assassin/terrorist Nadya Malovo from Robert K. Tanenbaum's <em>Butch Karp &amp; Marlene Ciampi</em> legal thriller novels. She actually prefers women over men, but she'll use her seductions on anyone in order to manipulate them.
</li><li> Heavily implied with Rodrick Rand, the deranged movie star in the comic neo-noir <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GetBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GetBlank">Get Blank</a>.</em> I mean, sure he wanted to hunt a couple of people, but did he really need them in a bikini and a banana hammock?

And then when that man dies, he's willing to act like that man's ten-year-old daughter attracts him instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAgeOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAgeOfInnocence">The Age of Innocence</a></em>, Count Olenski, Ellen Olenska's husband, is implied to be this when a snide comment implies that his copious infidelities included men as well as women.

He is "ambisextrous" and in both versions of the story, he seduces one half of an incestuous brother duo. In the poem, he is also a convicted rapist, while the musical shows both the "depraved" and the "bisexual" when he gives a fourteen-year-old girl cocaine and then attempts to rape her.
</li><li> John Parlabane of Robertson Davies' Cornish Trilogy rhapsodizes at length about his relationships with men in <em>The Rebel Angels</em>, and in <em>The Lyre of Orpheus</em> another character turns up claiming to be his son by a married woman. Parlabane's general attitude is that nothing ever goes well for him in life because no one can handle either his intellect, his talent, or his lack of constraint by social mores. At the end of <em>The Rebel Angels</em>, it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he has been engaged in a kinky, drug-fuelled john/prostitute relationship, with Urquhart <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McVarish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McVarish">Mc Varish</a>, whom he subsequently murders before committing suicide.

</li><li> George Mellis in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon">Sidney Sheldon</a> novel <em>Master of the Game</em> is this and a sexual sadist to boot. His first scene is of him beating and sodomizing Eve Blackwell, who was perfectly eager to have sex with him before discovering his true nature-there are frequent descriptions of him going to bars and picking up women or men and leaving them broken and battered.
</li><li> Charles Morel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarcelProust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarcelProust">In Search of Lost Time</a></em>. Given the time period, the Narrator and others hold homosexuality/bisexuality itself somewhat depraved (although he does at one point attempt to reconcile Morel and Charlus), but Morel in particular is exceptionally manipulative and callous, casually toying with Charlus's emotions and attempting to seduce Jupien's niece with the premeditated goal of making her fall in love with him just to harshen the blow of him leaving her. It's presented as ironic that at the end of the book(s) he's repaired his reputation completely, although it's not clear whether he's actually changed his ways.
</li><li> Every single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a> character who's bisexual is a maniac who engages in every sort of sexual depravity possible aside from necrophilia, and that's only because they can't hurt someone who's already dead. Everything else is on the table: torture (the moment someone hints at the slightest interest in consensual bondage, they're destined to wind up as a brutal sadist), incest in every combination imaginable, mutilating people just to create novel sex toys, you name it. And it's all written in gory detail.

The notable exception to this is Bill, who has only ever had eyes for Sookie, and his past lovers were also female.

(Xander's vampire self has some subtext about this, too, regarding the imprisoned Angel.)
<ul><li> Joss has mentioned in interviews that they knew that either Willow or Xander would be gay/bi but weren't sure which, hence the several subtle hints for both in the first 3 seasons.
</li><li> It is notable though that Joss Whedon has explained Angel and Spike's canon sexual encounter with "they're vampires".

The implication is that vampires don't particularly care about gender when approaching sex objects, which ties into this trope quite nicely.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em> is practically overflowing with these characters, seeing as how it is about a prison that houses some of the most heinous criminals imaginable. The worst of which would be homicidal sociopath Chris Keller and homicidal psychopath Simon Adebisi. Also, Tobias Beecher. He had a wife who committed suicide and he falls in love with another woman while in Oz and falls in love with Chris Keller. He also has sexual relations with several men while in Oz and shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> tendencies the longer he's in Oz as well, such as when he killed a prison guard with long fingernails.
</li><li> Bobbi Stakowski from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit">Profit</a></em> is a prime example of the "manipulative" subtype; when her very rich, very married boyfriend turns out to come with a prenup stating that the first partner to ask for a divorce forfeits all the couple's assets, she goes out and seduces his wife.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaulOfTheMoleMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaulOfTheMoleMen">Saul of the Mole Men</a></em>, Saul's hated rival Nathaniel Baltimore, Old-Fashioned Bisexual. Nathaniel is really just a jackass, pointlessly firing his gun while Saul is talking just to interrupt him and never once admitting that Saul was right about the Mother Rock.
<ul><li> Nathaniel definitely counts as depraved. He's constantly licking his lips and sizing up the asses of both Saul and Fallopia, and at one point he jumps in the middle of one of their kisses.

He's not just a rapist and a murderer. He's a <em>child rapist</em> and a murderer. Despite that, he seemed to genuinely love the single mother he was involved with on the outside (who didn't know his real identity) and doted on her two kids. However, his psychosis caught up with him when he's exposed and bizarre attempts to force them to participate in a "picket fence" delusion after his escape forced him to cut ties permanently — he apparently considered killing them, but he couldn't bring himself to.
</li><li> Cy the Cyclops from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KrodMandoonAndTheFlamingSwordOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KrodMandoonAndTheFlamingSwordOfFire">Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire</a></em> is an openly bisexual Monster. While he seems pleasant at first, he then turns out to be utterly depraved and shows a desire to "sex and devour" the entire lead cast.
</li><li> The victim of one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> was a stockbroker who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> slept with both his young male protege (who had a crush on him) and the protege's mother solely in order to get them to invest money, which he then stole. Needless to say, this was the motive for his murder.</span>

Later in the series, she appears to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> since all her victims are women and she mentions being attracted to famous actresses and flirting with a female orderly, but she does also have crushes on various male characters including Shawn and the psychologist Mary Lightly.
</li><li> Tony from the first series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em>. While he gives his gay friend Maxxie fellatio on a school trip, it was "to try something new"; his college headmaster also refers to him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">"polysexual"</a>. Up to the finale of season 1, he manipulates everyone around him, but he reaches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after his girlfriend Michelle hooks up with another guy, Josh, he sends her pornographic pictures of Josh's sister from his phone to convince her he's mentally unstable.

</li><li> Not that overt, but Bennett in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> is implied to be bisexual, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">lesbian for Caroline</a> during their college days.

Even at Sterling Cooper, he was powerful enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get Sal Romano fired for rejecting his advances</span>. After the action moves to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, Lucky Strike makes up (at one point) <em>79%</em> of SCDP's revenue, and so when Garner says he'll be attending the company <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasParty">Christmas Party</a> — initially something of a joke, as Lane wanted to run it on a shoestring budget to save money needed for other things — SCDP is forced to put on a full-on party with music, a bartender, a fully-stocked bar, and decorations up the wazoo. Garner shows up incredibly late and starts hitting on Roger Sterling's <em>wife</em> (never mind that their marriage isn't a good one, it's still insulting), and forces Roger to play Santa. Since Lucky Strike is 79% of the budget:

To the point of gleefully squealing at the possibility that she, Penny, and Bernadette might be rolling around in the mud naked together. She is also constantly hitting on Penny and shows attraction to Priya (Raj's sister)...and constantly tries to bribe or trick Sheldon into sleeping with her. Much to Sheldon's dismay, although he seems to be getting used to it.
</li><li> The Benefactor aka Margot's brother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCatch">The Catch</a></em> is established as the villain in the show, with his sliminess, sexist behavior, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">depraved</a> attitude and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">shooting his bisexual girlfriend Felicity</a> after getting the info he wanted out of her</span>.

It is demonstrated repeatedly that Clarice sees all of her spouses, and indeed everyone else, as tools in her quest to advance herself and her religion (in that order). Her spouses are also the members of a particularly intimate terrorist cell with her as the de facto leader. Even most of Clarice's spouses are taken aback when Clarice appears to be trying to seduce a teenage girl and enlists her youngest husband to assist with this. Interestingly, this trope is further emphasized by the fact that the other adult characters, even the dysfunctional Graystone's, are more committed to their monogamous relationships. Most notable is the aversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">Depraved Homosexual</a> trope with Sam Adama, who is depicted as extremely loyal and devoted to his husband Larry.

One of the best examples of her insanity is when she rapes Beth Vanallen. With a <em>vase</em>.
<ul><li> From SOTF-TV, Marvia Jones could also be an example. Her first appearance on the island? Getting high, drugging Nate Chauncey, and taking advantage of her, culminating in beating her up and taking her things.

</li><li> For the third DVD promo, Doug himself played a shirtless, psychotic bisexual who was torturing a guy with a knife. Not necessary, but very much appreciated. The persona came back in a ConBravo interview, where he groped the interviewer and ended up riding him like a pony, he'd had years of experiences in sexing people up, he'd slept with both James and his wife, he was non-exclusively married to Benzaie, and he'd ruined JewWario's balls through getting teabagged.

Female: Torres, Seven of Nine, and <em>herself</em>. As for the depravity, anyone who offers drugs and cigarettes to small children they are training up to be loyal minions, breeds a "rape gorilla", and has created hives of flying tarantulas with a taste for ocular jelly probably has enough depravity to supply entire legions of demented Roman emperors.

</li><li> Meg. She spends her free time trying to get a boyfriend (this even includes her falling for Brian when he was nice to her) and in episodes like "Stew-Roids" and "Dial Meg For Murder", she appears to exhibit attraction toward Connie, a girl who constantly bullies her. Some episodes depict her being both emotionally fragile and disturbed, derived from desperation for love and attention.

He's married to Lois and definitely interested in women (including one instance where he wanted to have sex with a female rat) but lusts after men usually every other episode (he was in an abusive sexual relationship with a male bull who had raped him). There are even unfortunate implications that he's sexually attracted to minors (he has a crush on Connie D'Amico and once told Lois that he shouldn't nag him about being a kids' show host as he "...can have any 3-year-old [he] wants.") "Fresh Heir" also implies he'll go as far as incest and ephebophilia, as it's heavily implied he wanted to do more than just marry his son Chris for his father-in-law's inheritance and occasionally has shown interest in his daughter Meg whom he also verbally and physically abuses (one instance had him requesting Meg kiss him on the lips). He also occasionally checks out young boys (including telling a kid he had a "sweet ass"), hinted at being turned on when he and Quagmire got naked and had to kiss and spooned with Quagmire when they were cuddling in bed together with Peter pulling down Quagmire's boxers, was not entirely weirded out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanReynolds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanReynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a> flirting with him, roleplayed Dawson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek">Dawson's Creek</a></em> to Carter (playing a girl) and tried to kiss him while hinting he wanted to have sex with him (explaining he was doing so because that's Dawson's character), willingly slept with Bill Clinton, responding to Christian Bale's statement of "We're done professionally" with an excited "Are you asking me out on a date?", and ordering Chris to take Lois' place while she is away. Chris, playing Lois, sits next to Peter and compliments his muscles. Peter plays along and promises obscene sex for that night.
