He gathers up as many and trains an army and starts a war with England and kills millions FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF LOSING. All he wants is to have a great war and take Alucard down in the process, dedicating 50 years of his life and countless funds into doing so.

Then it was announced that he was confirmed to be the main character in the sequel which is officially named "Lelouch of the Resurrection", which aligns with the mountain of official statements (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GeassedbyLelouch/comments/8hklfr/evaluating_code_theory_main_body_index/">database with official statements<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) about his death.

Instead, he valued everyone else's well-being over his own and died hoping that no one would ever hate another person again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also explained that the Zero Requiem was also redemption for Lelouch and that he thought that death was the only fitting punishment.

<ul><li> Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage, in sealing the fox; turns out he wanted to give his son Naruto a weapon against Tobi, the masked man responsible for the attack. That, and stopping a giant fox from killing them all. On top of that making the seal so he would appear when his son was stupid, distraught or desperate enough to consider releasing it.
</li><li> This also included making the seal with the chakra of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom">Action Mom</a> wife, Kushina. This is not just to keep the Kyuubi pinned down again (she used to be its host, after all), but to give her a chance to appear in Naruto's mind and see their son, granting Kushina her last wish.
</li><li> Kisame also pulls this off after Might Guy takes him down, by simultaneously committing suicide with his own shark summons so the Shinobi Alliance can't search his mind for information, and by booby-trapping the scroll he was supposed to deliver to Tobi so that the good guys would be distracted while another summoned shark made a getaway with the information.

The whole point of his actions are to redeem the Uchiha clan and to allow his brother to be seen as a hero for killing him after he massacred the Uchiha clan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">It fails spectacularly</a>.

This didn't go as planned due to Nagato making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and sacrificing his life to revive the villagers he killed, and Tobi going to become the jinchuuriki of the Ten Tails himself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceptiveDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceptiveDisciple">never having any intention of reviving him</a>.

And in the end, the old guy still gets the upper hand when it turns out that he has secretly adopted an heir (the protagonist).

Unable to hold back like he usually did, Spidey nearly tore New York apart trying to get to her (beating up Ben Reilly and the entire team of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewWarriors">New Warriors</a> in the process) while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside">Fighting from the Inside</a> the whole time, to no avail.

John Constantine knows he's dying of lung cancer, so he decides to take a massive risk and, in one of his last acts on Earth, <em>really</em> fuck with Hell. His soul is already the right of the First of the Fallen by insult (he tricked the First into drinking holy water), so he sells his soul to both the Second and the Third of the Fallen, the First's co-rulers in Hell. And then he slits his wrist, forcing the three rulers of Hell to decide whether to go to war over John's soul (and risk letting Heaven take over) or cure his cancer. They choose to cure the cancer. And after that's all said and done, John repays them by turning around and giving them the finger, saying, "Up yours." Also, note this story may not be part of the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCUniverse">DC Universe</a>'s continuity since The Fallen were not referenced in the <em>Reign in Hell</em> miniseries (which was about a war to take over hell.)

Osborn, in fact, left a posthumous message for Peter to mock him, twisting the knife in even deeper. The intense trauma that the incident inflicted upon him actually caused Spidey to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">Not Himself</a> and become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> for a while.

To add insult to injury, he planned to kill off all of the worst enemies in the same blast that would end his life.

Entrants must be vital and free of diseases. Every winner becomes a cruel tyrant, but the hero of the story (called weak and frail all his life) wants to become a ruler and end the reign of evil. He wins, and at his "coronation", he's drugged, bound, his skull is cut open by robot surgeons (after he wakes up), his brain is crudely removed over his screaming protests, and the brain of the previous king is transplanted from his freshly-dead, used up, obese corpse. In death, however, the hero is victorious. The stress of the surgery sets off his congenital heart defect, and the tyrant is slain.

Specifically, she went and pissed off a group of touch-phobic radicals, screaming her name so they'd know who to seek revenge on, the night before she froze her head. Because her actions exiled one of their own, they sought retribution. When the group finally tracked her down and found she was a frozen head, they went after next of kin, ie, Spider. They thought that Spider, as her ex-husband, would still care about her safety and kidnapped her head as collateral. Spider proceeded to throw her head into the river.

But he will not compromise his values by keeping the inside job a secret, so he accepts that Dr. Manhattan will murder him rather than risk letting him exposing the knowledge. It's implied that Rorschach's journal may be revealed to the public and he will get his way anyway, which depending on your point of view might not be a good thing, because that would mean both the genocide and Rorschach's death had been in vain.

Moloch died under peculiar circumstances and even before then was known to be suffering from terminal cancer, so he believes he might be ideal for this kind of plot. He dismisses it a moment later, however, believing Moloch not to be intelligent enough to orchestrate it.

This makes it unbelievably powerful and nearly unstoppable, allowing the wizard to do any number of nasty things to the victim — if killing one's own murderer is not possible, <em>crippling</em> him usually is. However, the wizard needs a moment of focus to do that (which is apparently possible even if he just had his throat cut or is on fire), so the safest way to kill a wizard is a sniper bullet from a few thousand feet away.

Harry then had Molly remove the memory of the arrangement from him, so that he wouldn't see it coming. Subverted because Mab saw it coming. She's not upset though. She also saves his life, because he fell in <em>cold water</em> and she's the Queen of Winter, otherwise it might have worked.

As he was dying he gave several of his advisors small, mysterious bags which were to be opened in a specific order after his death, and each containing instructions for a Thanatos Gambit so effective that it tricked Sima Yi into thinking Liang had faked his death... complete with a statue of himself that from a distance (and the mental rattling following an explosion) looked like the late Zhuge Liang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorpseHesAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorpseHesAlive">was still alive and commanding the army from his carriage.</a>
<ul><li> Another set of bags contained plans to set up and then kill off Wei Yan, who he'd predicted would turn traitor after his death: his main opponent in the field was to offer that if Wei Yan shouted three times "Who dares kill me?" he would surrender the capital; when Wei Yan shouted it once his 'loyal' partner in the revolt — the recipient of another bag — yelled out "I dare!" and cut him down.

Also, see below.
</li><li> How to explain the ending to <em>Accelerando</em>... Well, first of all, at this point in the story (and much earlier), people can copy their minds indiscriminately, sort of like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> turned up to eleven. Aineko, essentially an artificial intelligence derived partially from a cat, wants to finally leave Manfred Marcx's life and that of his family, and in the process, get a fresh working copy of his mind so that she can validate whether <em>another</em> copy of Manfred is genuine or not; the used copy will then be deleted (killed). So she manipulates his entire family, including bringing a copy of Manfred's first wife Pamela out of cold storage, so that 1. Manfred will say yes, 2. the entire family will hate Aineko, with the result that 3. Manfred's clone/grandson will kill that instance of Aineko.

For her efforts, she gets impaled on a wooden pike and is so disgusted at herself for saving everyone, she dies with snark on her lips: rejecting one's offer to save her life by turning her into a vampire, and informing another that her brother (whom she's kidnapped) has been turned into a shapeshifter...only she's not going to tell her which animal he is. As another character puts it: "That's how I want to go. Taking my own way out, and totally pissing everybody off at the end."
</li><li> The terminally ill Troy Phelan from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham">John Grisham</a>'s novel <em>The Testament</em> commits suicide and screws his family (whom he hates) out of his eleven billion dollar fortune, giving it all to an illegitimate daughter instead. The kicker is that before his death, he fooled his own family into thinking he had signed a (fake) will that evenly distributed his assets and even had a team of top-notch doctors examine him and declare him mentally competent. After his death, the doctors' testimony made it next to impossible for his family to legally challenge his will. Not only that, <em>but he tricked his family into digging themselves into debt</em> since they were expecting a free cash handout after he died.
</li><li> In the novel <em>Burr</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a> (about, and partly from the perspective of, Aaron Burr, the third vice-president of the United States) it is strongly suggested by Burr (citing actual historical evidence) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> took pains to ensure that if he were killed in the duel, he would ruin Burr's political career in the process (this is what happened). See Real Life for one example; also, in the book, Burr describes how Hamilton made sure to endear himself to everyone who knew him so that he would be seen as a martyr and wrote letters which after the fact, made Burr look like a bloodthirsty killer.

Tyrion Lannister, having been accused of murdering his nephew Joffrey, demands trial by combat. Oberyn Martell of Dorne volunteers as his champion. Among Tyrion's foremost accusers are the Tyrells, as Joffrey's wife Margaery Tyrell has now been widowed (again), not to mention had her life endangered by the poisoning. The Tyrells and Martells <em>hate</em> each other. Thus, if Ser Gregor, champion for the accusers, dies, Tyrion lives and the Tyrells will be furious and demand retribution. If Oberyn dies, Tyrion does as well, but the Martells and all the rest of Dorne will be furious and demand retribution. Either way, it'll destroy Tywin Lannister's careful plans and provide the catalyst for more warfare, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">which is just the thing that series needs</a>.
<ul><li> Oberyn Martell sort of had one of these himself. Gleefully accepting his part in Tyrion's gambit to gain revenge upon Clegane for his sister Elia's rape and murder, he coated his weapons with an agonizingly lethal poison, so even if he lost the duel, he'd take his killer with him.
</li><li> A more modest example is Qhorin Halfhand, who tells Jon that should they run into any wildlings while they're on their recon mission beyond the Wall, he's to pretend to want to join them so he can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a> and stay alive until he gets a chance to run away and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringNewsBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringNewsBack">Bring News Back</a>. He tells Jon to do anything the wildlings ask of him to keep up appearances, even if it means breaking his vows as a member of the Night's Watch. As it turns out, and as Qhorin well knows, the first proof they want is for Jon to kill Qhorin.

<ul><li> This is perhaps the ultimate example of a Thanatos Gambit, as Aes Sedai are particularly adept at a variety of Gambits, and Verin had planned for many, many years to study the Black Ajah from within, then make use of the "dying hour" clause in her alternate Oath in order to present her studies to someone who could use it against them.
</li><li> The Thanatos Gambit <em>averted</em>. Lan Mandragoran averts this trope to great effect during the Last Battle while dueling the incredibly powerful Forsaken, Demandred. An exhausted Lan knew he was incapable of outright defeating the fresh Demandred in single combat; Lan knew his only way to defeat his opponent was via a tactic known as <em>Sheathing the Sword</em> (a technique whereby you purposely open yourself up to a lethal blow in order to open your opponent up to a lethal counterstrike of your own.) Demandred, believing victory was at hand, pressed his advantage in a final flurry. The moment Demandred believed he landed the winning blow, Lan counterattacked by driving his sword into Demandred's throat, who was unable to block as his own sword was buried in Lan's side. While Lan's wound should have been fatal, he was healed in time by an Asha'man, thus averting this trope.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Mythology and Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Jesus Christ/God, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. His plan is for him to become human to die for humankind's sin, and through his resurrection, they are reborn and saved.
<ul><li> On a mundane level, it's easy to interpret Jesus' martyrdom as a deliberate gambit to undermine the Roman Empire. He couldn't fight them by force, but by becoming a symbolic figure, he could hope to convert them, and in a few centuries, he was successful. According to this interpretation, his prediction that Judas would betray him could be seen as an <em>instruction</em>, and some scholars have taken this view and look at Judas as a misunderstood and more heroic person.
</li><li> On a more theological level, the death of Jesus is something of a serendipitous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a>. Jesus' death was to take the punishment for humanity's sin. Since sin is the thing that caused the brokenness of the relationship between humanity and God, and since humanity is the ones who caused that brokenness, it is the responsibility of humanity to fix what they messed up. However, only God has the ability to fix the problem, and only a sinless person could offer payment for someone else's sin (since a sinful person could only pay for their own). Jesus, being both human and divine, on top of being sinless, manages to answer all of the conditions.

It didn't <em>quite</em> work, but it <em>did</em> cause him such incredible agony that he asked to be put on a funeral pyre, betting that his father Zeus would see it and raise him up to immortality on Olympus. It worked.

Although most of the area will be locked off until you're "supposed" to be here, you can still grab some useful equipment, rescue an NPC who will otherwise be dead by the time you get here normally, and fight an optional boss.

Thing is, while Peko killed Mahiru believing it'd be all for Kuzuryuu's sake, he <em>never</em> saw her as a tool, but actually <em>loved her as a person</em>. As a result, Peko is executed by the rules of the game, and Kuzuryuu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">loses an eye</a> trying to help her.</span>

The death is originally seen as a suicide, before it's revealed that it was really an accidental murder by one of the students, with almost no way to determine who it was. Nagito's plan was for them to either mistake it for a true suicide and vote him the culprit, or be forced to blindly guess which one of them was the accidental culprit, killing them all and letting the culprit (the traitor) go free. However, through his protagonist powers and some guidance from her, Hajime reveals that the culprit and traitor is actually Chiaki Nanami. She faces her execution stoically, leaving Hajime without either of his two closest friends on the island and burdened with the knowledge of his and the others' pasts. Thanks, Nagito.</span> Even worse, if this one had succeeded, it would have <em>horrifically</em> backfired, since not only does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monokuma a.k.a. the Junko AI <em>want</em> someone to graduate so that it can overwrite the minds of the dead students with its own personality, but Chiaki is <em>also</em> an AI and can't leave the simulation even if she <em>did</em> graduate.

He disables Monokuma's cameras with an EMP, then films Kaito <em>almost</em> being flattened by a hydraulic press before pausing the recording, switching places with him, and having Kaito kill him with the press instead. Kaito was instructed to then cut the power cord to the press so that nobody could raise it up to confirm the identity of the body, and then <em>pilot a mech to the trial and pretend to be Kokichi</em>. The mech has a voice changer that let him sound like Kokicki, and Kokichi had provided him with an <em>enormous</em> script that accounted for almost every possible thing someone could say in the trial so that he could convincingly act like him</span>.
<ul><li> It was made even more confusing by the fact that before the plan was put into motion, Maki had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shot Kokichi with a poisoned crossbow bolt, and when her attempt at interrogating him fell through, she tried shooting him again, only for Kaito to take the hit. When Maki ran to get an antidote, the boys locked her out of the hangar and forced her to pass it through the window, allowing Kokichi to steal it. He then pretended to drink the antidote to make it seem like Kaito died from poisoning and was thrown in the press to hide the body, further complicating the trial by obscuring the murder weapon and making the culprit one of three possible killers</span>.

</li><li> According to cutscenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em>, the Overmind was not acting out of malice. Despite having total control of the swarm, it was not blessed with perfect free will, having an over-riding directive to consume and destroy (especially if its target was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Protoss</a>). (Except for the part about Protoss, the fact that the Xel'Naga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">more specifically Amon and his followers</span> instilled such a directive in the Zerg as part of their attempt to create a race with "Purity of Spirit" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">established in the original game's manual</a>, but a lot of people either didn't read that part or ignore it.) This directive may have come from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Xel'naga</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amon again</span>), in an effort to take revenge on the Protoss for not being good children. The Overmind foresaw the effects of this directive: the end of all life at the hands of another power in the void. So along the way to kill the Protoss, it started looking for a replacement. It chooses a human psionic, Sarah Kerrigan, who when properly infested could gain control over the Zerg. Then it decided to take physical form in Aiur, the homeworld of the Protoss, likely the only race in the galaxy save the Xel'Naga who could kill the Overmind. And by taking physical form, it made its own demise possible. However, it also made sure that Kerrigan was conveniently occupied elsewhere during its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">fateful meeting with Tassadar</a>. Kerrigan, not plagued with that pesky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> directive, would be able to guide the Zerg and prevent universal doom. Thus, the Overmind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">goes from</a> former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">working for the good guys all along.</a> Nice one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Blizzard</a>.
<ul><li> This also ties up a couple of plot stupidities from the first game. The Overmind made a big deal about Kerrigan being really, really important. So why leave her behind on Char when he attacked Aiur? Now we know; so that she could take over after he was dead. Also, why bother taking physical form, when physical forms have a nasty habit of being <em>killable</em>? Well, if you're all incorporeal and unkillable, you can't pull off a Thanatos Gambit, can you?
</li><li> On a lesser note, it is hinted in the lore that when an Archon is created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">merging two templar</a>, the templar are essentially killed and the Archon is actually a new powerful being that is an expression of pure rage that is not entirely stable and will dissipate automatically after a short time.

In his last will, he bequeathed his worthwhile assets to his servants and left equal shares of the American land to his sons. He knew that the sons were competitive beyond reason, and quite accurately guessed that they would spend the rest of their lives fighting over the land, leading to the creation of the RED and BLU teams.

Often, the Jester will team up with other players, who'll get them lynched in exchange for the Jester killing a target of their choice, or who'll lynch the Jester in exchange for the Jester helping them out with lynching someone else before they die.
</li><li> Vampires convert other players into vampires, but there is a four vampire limit. If vampires have majority control but have reached their limit, they can lynch innocent town members to win. Or a compassionate and strategic vampire can have themselves lynched to make room for more vampires. This way there are more vampires to get points for winning the game, and the lynched vampire still wins also.

<ul><li> When Charles Vance Millar died, he included a provision in his will that promised most of his estate to whichever woman in Toronto gave birth to the most legitimate children in the next ten years. This led to an event known as The Great Stork Derby. He was a lawyer himself and prepared the will with extra care to ensure that it could not be found invalid. And Millar is (relatively) famous to this day ... at least among estate lawyers.
<ul><li> Other clauses in the will left lifetime joint tenancy of a house to three men who were well known to hate each other, and bequests to Protestant temperance leaders consisting of shares in a (Catholic-owned) brewery, which they only got if they actively participated in the operation of the business.
</li></ul></li><li> This was one of the motivations behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine High School Massacre</a>. They wanted to get in the history books in the most infamous way possible and create an ongoing controversy, which they succeeded at, sadly.
</li><li> This may have been the case with John Wilkes Booth, who shot and assassinated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> at Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was watching a performance of <em>Our American Cousin</em>, 5 days after the Civil War ended with Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. Booth had planned to avenge the Confederates' loss and dissolution, with other assassins plotting against Vice-President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJohnson">Andrew Johnson</a> and Secretary of State William Seward; Johnson's potential assassin lost his nerve, and Seward was merely wounded by stabbing. Lincoln died on April 15th, resulting in Johnson succeeding Lincoln as President, resulting in Johnson offering his own Reconstruction plan which empowered Southern states, opposing the Fourteenth Amendment to no avail when it was ratified by Congress in 1868. After shooting Lincoln, Booth made a dramatic escape, injuring his leg after jumping to the stage below, fleeing to southern Maryland and then Richard Garrett's farm in Port Royal, Virginia, where he was shot in a flaming barn by Union troops led by Boston Corbett on April 26th.
<ul><li> In 1907, Memphis lawyer Finis L. Bates wrote <em>The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth</em>, a book which claimed that Booth was not killed by Union soldiers, but had eluded capture and assumed a number of aliases which included John St. Helen and David E. George among others, with Bates encountering John St. Helen, a liquor merchant in Granbury, Texas, who had theatrical tendencies and could recite Shakespeare from memory. St. Helen developed a friendship with Bates and in 1878, St. Helen allegedly confessed that he was John Wilkes Booth. In 1903, a house painter by the name of David E. George committed suicide by ingesting poison on January 13, 1903, in Enid, Oklahoma Territory. Afterwards, Bates stored the body in his garage, exhibiting it around the country in circus sideshows as Booth's corpse, changing hands several times, vanishing at a Midwestern carnival in the 1970s.
</li></ul></li><li> Allegedly, Alvaro Colom, the president of Guatemala, was involved in an illicit deal involving the appointment of an honest and well-known businessman, Khalil Musa, to a bank known to launder money for drug dealers. Purportedly, Musa and his daughter Marjorie were killed by Colom's men in exchange for some kind of favorable deal. Allegedly, Musa's lawyer/Marjorie's boyfriend Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano was first threatened and then violently murdered when he wouldn't shut up about the alleged cover-up. If true, this would've solved all of President Colom's problems... until the above allegations were broadcast on national television on a pre-recorded video, in which the deceased opened with the words, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_ODpxMA10&amp;">"Good morning. My name is Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano. And regrettably, if you are currently watching or listening to this message, it's because I was murdered by President Alvaro Colom..."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> It gets weirder: UN investigators have said that Rosenberg <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/world/americas/13guatemala.html?ref=world">arranged his own assassination<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in a massive frame-up.

Predictably, when the guy died in odd circumstances, the Rudin family soon started investigating Margaret, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">whose first husband died mysteriously as well...</a>
</li><li> The Sri Lankan journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge pulled one of these. He was murdered, but not before <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/13/wickrematunga-final-editorial-final-editorial">writing a final editorial about his own murder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which was published 3 days later. It's unclear whether it worked; a key part of the article seems to be aimed at the President.
</li><li> Some people believe that President of Rwanda Juvénal Habyarimana pulled this one in order to start the Rwandan Genocide. Before his death, it was clear that the Hutu militia was planning something beforehand, with evidence such as convincing the French to military train them and buying machetes from China, only to accept the UN "peace agreement" in 1993. One year later, Habyarimana was assassinated and no one has yet been convicted, but almost immediately after the news about the assassination had reached Rwanda, the Hutu militia went out and killed one million Tutsis in just three months, which shows that the genocide must have been planned sometime before 1994.
<ul><li> Of course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">alternate interpretation</a> is that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief">somebody else</a> in the government who decided that the death of the president would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">perfect catalyst</a> for the genocide, and that Habyarimana <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">didn't know this part</a> until it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">too late</a>.

In 1931 Singh and his accomplice used this trope to further their political cause - they assaulted a courtroom with smoke bombs and fired their gun into the ceiling, and when the police showed up they turned in their weapons and surrendered. The British decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">make an example of</a> Singh with a heavily publicized trial - which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">exactly what he wanted</a> - it gave them a platform for spreading their views, and contributed to the popularization of the slogan "Total Independence". During the trial, Singh also went on hunger strike in protest at the much poorer conditions of non-European prisoners in police custody, during which he went <em>sixty days</em> without food. Singh and two others were convicted and eventually killed one day before their official execution date (so there could be no public protest or obstruction or breakout attempt), and their bodies shoddily burned and disposed of. Ironically, this <em>also</em> played right into Singh's plans, as the brutality of the act caused widespread uproar among the populace and created even more problems for the British regime.
</li><li> It's believed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukioMishima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukioMishima">Yukio Mishima</a>'s infamous pro-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> coup against the post-war Japanese government was merely an excuse so he could commit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">seppuku</a> and die the way he wanted to. Since there was no chance that said coup would <em>ever</em> be successful, given Japan's socio-political circumstances, Mishima probably put himself <em>deliberately</em> in a situation where his honor was compromised to the point that, according to his Samurai-like view of the world, an honorable and ritualised death was the only way out.
</li><li> Brazilian president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GetulioVargas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GetulioVargas">Getúlio Vargas</a> successfully defused a deep political crisis by shooting himself dead. The crisis started when one of his minions (possibly without Vargas' directly knowledge) attempted murder on Carlos Lacerda, a journalist/politician/newspaper owner, who was one of Vargas' most ardent opposers. The attempt failed and killed a (voluntary) bodyguard instead. Lacerda then railed against Vargas, demanding the president's resignation. Instead of resigning, Vargas killed himself, leaving a letter as his political will. This action immediately defused the crisis and turned popular anger against Lacerda, who had his newspaper's headquarters raided by Vargas' supporters the next day. With his suicide, Vargas ensured that his party (actually, parties, in plural, it's... complicated) stayed in power ten more years, until a military coup, supported again by Lacerda, installed a military dictatorship that would last twenty years. The gun, and his pyjama with a bullet hole in the heart, <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/GetulioVargasPijamaRevolver.jpg/800px-GetulioVargasPijamaRevolver.jpg">are on exhibit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in the former Presidential palace in Rio de Janeiro, now a museum.

To force him to, they piled rocks on him and asked him three times to enter a plea. His reply each time was "More weight." Those were his final words. His reason? As long as he refused to enter a plea, the state could not seize his property, and by pretty much sacrificing his own life he could make sure that his widow and his family would be well provided for. Particularly noble considering entering either pleas would have resulted in his death anyways. In this way he died, but not needlessly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">His widow Martha wouldn't get to enjoy the fruits of his success, though</a>, as she followed him the next day via the gallows.
</li><li> It appears former NFL player Dave Duerson arranged this. Based on how he died (a gunshot wound to his chest) and his last communications to his family (to have his brain examined for the effects of post-concussion syndrome, which includes severe depression amongst its symptoms, upon his death), many (including several former NFL players) believe he deliberately killed himself in such a fashion to have an intact brain sample to show how destructive the sport was (and can still be) to players and force the league to better support its players' health.
<ul><li> Also related to NFL football: With her last breaths, a woman named Cherica Adams called the police and made sure they knew that a promising NFL player, Carolina Panthers' Rae Carruth, was responsible for her murder, even though the gunman was someone else, hired by Rae after Cherica didn't want to abort the kid of Rae's that she was pregnant with. The hired gunman, Van Brett Walkins, later testified against Rae and claimed that Rae not only paid him for the killing but threatened him as well if he didn't go through with it. The police and paramedics were able to save the child, who was eight months along at the time, but Cherica died later in the hospital; as a result, Rae was convicted for conspiring to commit first-degree murder.

</li></ul></li><li> Codrus, the last king of Athens, during a siege by Spartans, dressed up as a poor man, went out of the city and provoked the enemy into killing him. Why? Because there was a prophecy that the siege would be successful unless the king is harmed. As soon as the Spartans learned what they did, they returned the body and left. The Athenians considered it such an amazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> that they abolished the monarchy in Athens, although the old royal house was given certain privileges (for instance, a particular magistrate—the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_basileus">archon basileus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or "king magistrate"—would always be a member of the royal family).
</li><li> This <em>may</em> have been the case of R.

Dwyer, who had been maintaining his innocence, had any shot at a not guilty verdict ruined when William Smith, who was also convicted in the same case, falsely testified against him under oath in exchange for a lighter sentence. Therefore, Dwyer might have committed suicide both to not go to jail and to make sure that his family could collect his life insurance and pension since his life insurance policy did not include the usual exclusion for suicide. (<a class="urllink" href="http://articles.philly.com/1987-05-02/news/26165385_1_state-employees-retirement-board-treasurer-r-budd-dwyer-pension-rights">Here are some more details.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> Downplayed by pathologist Francisc Rainer; the extent of his planning consisted of a self-diagnosis, a prediction of exactly when he would die, and instructions for the embalming of his remains after he shuffled off his mortal coil. Rather morbidly, his self-diagnosis and prediction of when he died were right on the mark.
</li><li> In 381 BC, when <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Qi">Wu Qi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s biggest supporter, the King of Chu, died, Wu knew he would be killed by the old aristocrats he suppressed with the late King's approval. So when his enemies attempted to assassinate him on the late King's funeral, he decided to run to the royal corpse and have the rain of arrows fall on him—and the late king <em>as well</em>. The new king had no choice but to execute those aristocratic families <em>wholesale</em>, not for murdering Wu, but for making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPincushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPincushion">Human Pincushion</a> of his own father.
</li><li> Fox Lake, Illinois police officer Lt. Charles Joseph Glinewicz attempted this in 2015 but failed. On September 1st, he radioed in that he was pursuing three suspects; officers arrived on the scene to find Glinewicz shot to death, and a large-scale manhunt began which lasted over a week. It was eventually discovered that Glinewicz had been embezzling from a department-sponsored youth program he was in charge of; the village had ordered an audit, and he knew his theft would be discovered...so he staged his suicide to look like a homicide, in an attempt to cover up his crime.
</li><li> Religiously-motivated terrorist attacks are often designed to be suicidal for the attacker, under the belief that there will be a divine reward for the act (like the infamous 72 virgins) in the afterlife.
</li><li> Believed to have been the motive behind the suicide of Aaron Hernandez in prison. The former NFL player had just been granted an appeal to his murder conviction, but the odds of a successful appeal were low. However, due to a very old state law, someone who died while appealing their sentence would have the prior guilty verdict set aside and would, legally, be considered innocent. It's believed that Hernandez did so in order for his family to sue for the money owed under his contract by the Patriots that they'd withheld because of his conviction.
<ul><li> Hernandez's death also enabled his family to have his brain studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head, increasingly seen in football players. CTE can only be diagnosed via autopsy and is associated with aggressiveness, explosiveness, impulsivity, depression, memory loss, and other cognitive changes. When he was diagnosed with stage 3 CTE, the most severe case yet to be seen in a person of his age, his fiance was able to use it as grounds for a lawsuit against the NFL.
</li></ul></li><li> Some historians speculate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> allowed Aaron Burr to kill him in their duel. Hamilton had been depressed since the death of his son Philip three years prior on the same dueling field, his Federalist party was well on its way out (partially thanks to Burr), and he shot the tree behind Burr, whose political career was destroyed by the murder charge.
</li><li> Attempted by Thomas G.

Facing charges of armed robbery, he purchased a number of insurance plans that'd give his family a payout of $300,000 after his death, along with several sticks of dynamite. While he succeeded in crashing the plane, when it was discovered his death was a suicide the insurance companies only gave his family a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">$3 refund</a>.
