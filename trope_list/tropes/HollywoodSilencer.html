This sound is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">The Coconut Effect</a>.
</p><p>Basically, silencers control the discharge of gases that occur when a bullet is fired, which produce much of the sound. It's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>: the smooth assassin can make his hit, then melt into the night with nary a sound.
</p><p>The idea of the Hollywood Silencer is so prevalent that real silencers were commercially rebranded as "suppressors" in the 1970s to cash in on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a> owners who wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> but might become litigeous when their "silenced" pistol still made an ear-shattering kaboom.
</p><p>Additionally, for silencers to work properly, the bullets must travel at a subsonic speed, which can make them less accurate or deadly. Take note of how suppressors affect your gun in most video games.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Spotting a silenced <em>revolver</em> is almost always a definite sign that the work is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">gunning</a> for realism. However, some revolvers like the Nagant Model 1895 <em>can</em> be suppressed because they are designed to seal the cylinder gap when firing.
</p><p>"Real" silencers as used by governmental agencies do indeed muffle the sound of a gunshot to the same degree as seen in films and television, but these are custom designed weapons rather than aftermarket add-ons. In addition, they're still not exactly <em>silent</em>, sounding like a loud cough.

And the Welrod <em>is</em> one of quietest firearms ever made.
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Gunsmith Cats: Burst</em> when Misty customizes a Python revolver to accept a suppressor, only to be chewed out by Rally because, with the weapon being a revolver, the suppressor has no effect.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em>, which took actual audio from the guns used and doesn't completely diminish the sound when a silencer is fitted. If anything the sound of the silenced guns is more like a "pew" than a "bang" and it's still fairly loud.
</li><li> Averted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> where, when confronted by Conan under the stands, the episode's culprit knows that a silencer does not completely mask a gun's noise, but he's in a crowded stadium where everyone around is watching a football match so he can still shoot without attracting unwanted attention.
<ul><li> Played completely straight when a silencer (and a scarf covering the muzzle flash) lets Pisco fire a gun in a crowded room to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingChandelierOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingChandelierOfDoom">bring down a chandelier</a> on his victim without drawing any attention to himself.
</li><li> In one case, the murderer covered up the sound of gunfire by firing the silenced gun at the same time as party poppers were being set off for a party. Considering someone a floor away from the party but <em>literally</em> an arm's length away from the gun completely failed to notice it, it would still have to be pretty damn quiet.

Subverted in that we don't actually hear the sound so can't judge how well it worked.
<ul><li> In the same arc a special forces group ambush cartel members with silenced M4 rifles. The effect is more like a quiet buzzsaw than the usual <em>fwip</em>.

This is apparently <em>somewhat</em> effective with small, low-powered rounds in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

Nova does <em>not</em> have a silencer for her weapon, Hollywood-style or realistic.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Film </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneIdentity">The Bourne Identity</a></em> where the Treadstone operative that kills <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Conklin</span> uses a silenced pistol that sounds rather accurate. Although this is all the more confusing due to the fact that all the other silenced pistols in the movie had used the traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">Coconut</a> sound effect. However, the suppressor on the Professor's rifle appears to be a Hogue OverMolded free-floating handguard for the AR-15/M16 rifle and is simply slid over the barrel, which even if functional would do nothing to the muzzle report without being physically attached to the barrel.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork">Escape from New York</a></em>, in which Snake Plissken has a MAC-10 with a colossal silencer and the sound is more like "CHOOM" than "fwip". Also, by the time Snake is captured by the Duke, the silencer is no longer effective, as evidenced by the scene where the Duke toys with the president by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">shooting around him</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesTontonsFlingueurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesTontonsFlingueurs">Les Tontons flingueurs</a></em>, a 1963 French movie. There is a gunfight scene, involving at least half a dozen people, each one wielding a silenced gun making a different sound, including one of a bottle being uncorked. (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u800rP78Xg">the scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalInstinct">Fatal Instinct</a></em>. When Max Shady test fires his silencer-equipped weapon in the train it makes a soft "fwip" as usual. He adjusts the silencer to "softer" and fires it again: this time it makes no noise at all.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal">Steven Seagal</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FireDownBelow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FireDownBelow">Fire Down Below</a></em>; his character uses a two-liter soda bottle as a silencer.
</li><li> Subverted in the Seagal movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderSiege">Under Siege</a></em> - Krill shoots the captain with a Hollywood silenced pistol; however, the guard stationed outside the room immediately runs in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostDogTheWayOfTheSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostDogTheWayOfTheSamurai">Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai</a></em>, Ghost Dog has a plethora of silenced guns which fire with the traditional <em>fwip</em>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday">Doomsday</a></em>: The suppressed rifles and silenced pistols make a fairly loud bang, but the main character's unsilenced pistol makes a really loud bang.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AScannerDarkly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AScannerDarkly">A Scanner Darkly</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr">Robert Downey Jr.</a>'s character creates a home made silencer. When tested, it explodes, amplifying the sound considerably and partially deafening Downey Jr.
</li><li> The sniper in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shooter">Shooter</a></em> uses a bottle as a makeshift silencer for his rifle. The bottle itself is stuffed with material to help muffle the sound, so the plastic bottle isn't doing the silencing, but rather the combination of paper, tissues, and possibly aluminum and/or water inside the bottle. Also, the rifle in question is firing .22 Long Rifle, which is fairly quiet to begin with — more of a loud pop than a boom, and quiet enough on their own that it's possible (but not recommended) to shoot ithout hearing protection. It's still a Hollywood Silencer, because the sound would be muffled, but not complete silenced, and especially if the bottle was filled with something to aid in suppressing it, that would affect its range as well.
</li><li> The otherwise brilliant movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em> features the silenced revolver mistake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoondockSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoondockSaints">The Boondock Saints</a></em> have silencers that make a small "fwip" sound, though they are mainly used to keep others from discovering their activities, not for the element of surprise.
</li><li> The barkeeper in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Desperado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Desperado">Desperado</a></em> has a silencer on his revolver that is obviously not even compatible with the weapon. Subverted in that it doesn't actually work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Payback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Payback">Payback</a></em> uses the pillow version of this with a revolver.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagnumForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagnumForce">Magnum Force</a></em>, a motorcycle cop killed a mob boss and another motorcycle cop using a silenced revolver. The silencer appears to be a length of tube with a slit cut out and is held on by friction alone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyHard">Spy Hard</a></em>, the trope is parodied: baddies use a pillow to silence the noise of the machine gun used to execute prisoners, who were <em>mimes</em> that "refused" to talk.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987">RoboCop (1987)</a></em>; Clarence Boddicker has a fairly large silencer on his pistol when he visits Bob Morton, and it doesn't make the "fwip"; it does what a real silencer does and turns a sharp crack into a dull thud that's still pretty loud. Since he destroys the house with a bomb anyways, it's questionable why he uses a suppressor.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em> 's pre-credits sequence, agent 006 Alec Trevelyan dispatches a lab technician with his silenced pistol and later uses it to shoot the first two Soviet troops that respond to the alarm in the gas tank room (the rest he blows away with an AK-47 he takes off one of the first two troops). Each time his gun makes an innocuous "pyoot" sound. The same noise is also made by Bond's little grappling hook gun he uses during the bungee jump off the dam.
</li><li> Semi-averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em>. Characters are alerted to a shooter in the next room by the <em>fwip</em> sound. Makes you wonder why the gunman bothered, if they heard him coming any way from the next room over through a shut door.
</li><li> Another aversion; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun">The Man with the Golden Gun</a></em> the gangster assassin from the opening scene has a silenced weapon, but you wouldn't have guessed based on the noise it makes.
</li><li> Yet another <em>Bond</em> aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></em>: On the stealth ship, Bond's suppressed Walther P99 sounds probably just a little less loud then it would without the suppressor.
</li><li> Semi-averted in the very first scene of the first film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo">Dr. No</a></em>, in which the silenced pistols are still relatively loud, and sound like someone offscreen banging on the hood of a car. There's just nobody else outside to notice, and it's not loud enough to hear from across the parking lot. Later, however, other silenced pistols play the trope straight, in particular the one used to execute Dent; the only sound heard is that of the bullets hitting the man's body.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted, at least in one instance, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NurseBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NurseBetty">Nurse Betty</a></em>. When one of the hitmen goes to the other room with his silenced pistol into the adjacent room to Betty to commit suicide with the door closed, the "thump" of the gun is loud enough to make Betty jump. Ironically, this is a movie about a person that had trouble separating soap opera characters with real people.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/USMarshals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/USMarshals">U.S. Marshals</a></em>. The Chinese spy Chen fires an assault rifle fitted with a suppressor at Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard at a cemetery. Gerard immediately reacts to the only slightly muffled gunfire, and shouts and screams are heard from funeral attendees away from the action.
</li><li> <em>McQ</em>. The opening murders of two policeman are committed with a .45 with a ridiculously short silencer. Later a witness is murdered with a silenced revolver. Only the silenced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns">MAC-10</a> sounds right, but as the Military Armaments Corporation was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">using this movie to showcase the weapon</a> it's not surprising.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoCountryForOldMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoCountryForOldMen">No Country for Old Men</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Anton Chigurh uses a silenced shotgun that's apparently quiet enough to fire in a small town, at night, with no one coming to investigate.
</li><li> Played to the extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissKissBangBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissKissBangBang">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a></em> where in one scene a bad guy has a silenced pistol that makes no gunshot noise at all. Not even 'fwip'! The only noise is that of the ejected cartridge hitting the floor - a sound effect that is normally <em>missing</em> in Hollywood movies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009">Sherlock Holmes (2009)</a></em>, visitors to 221b Baker Street are startled by the sound of repeated gunshots. It turns out that Holmes is trying to create a silencer for his Nagant M1895 revolver (see below), and failing miserably.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir">Con Air</a></em> - When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a>'s character stumbles on a betrayal plot, he tells a would-be gunman that if he fires his weapon, others would hear the shot come and investigate. The other man wordlessly replies by attaching a silencer to his pistol, to which Cage delivers the classic line: "Well hoo-ray for the sounds of fucking silence!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">Soylent Green</a></em> - Charlton Heston's character gets chased by some Mooks packing short-barreled revolvers fitted with silencers. It's handled surprisingly realistically; they emit a sort of dull, booming thump that's far from quiet, but which wouldn't be readily identifiable as gunfire at a distance.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>, an incompetent CIA agent attempts to clumsily put one on his gun while his target complains about him calling it a "European silencer" when it is in fact called a suppressor.
</li><li> The original 1962 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManchurianCandidate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManchurianCandidate">The Manchurian Candidate</a></em>: "Is that a silencer?" Yes, and it's on a revolver.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em>, Cobb's silenced pistol does indeed make the "fwip" sound. However, he's only seen using it in the dream world so it can be assumed that Cobb simply imagined the Hollywood-esque one. Also subverted in that when he uses it, he catches the bodies before they hit the ground as to not attract attention. He also catches the shell casings in midair, nicely accounting for the noise they'd ordinarily make when they hit the ground.
</li><li> The 1972 French comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTallBlondManWithOneBlackShoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTallBlondManWithOneBlackShoe">The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe</a></em> featured several government spies with silenced guns that, when fired, emitted only a puff of smoke with no sound at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithOneRedShoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithOneRedShoe">The Man with One Red Shoe</a></em>, two competing teams of agents use these in Drew's apartment.
</li><li> Parodied in the Polish comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kiler">Kiler</a></em>, where all gangsters participating in a parking shootout use Hollywood Silencers and the TV reporters filming the scene from a distance comment that they will have to mix in gunfire sounds to make the scene more realistic.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSiege">The Siege</a></em> has the kidnapping of a terrorist leader. A herd of goats are driven across the road in front of a limousine, making it stop. We hear the faint sound of a silenced automatic weapon firing over the jangling of goat bells, then the camera pans to show the bullet-riddled car and the terrorist being dragged away by US special forces.
</li><li> The pistols used by the heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGunsOfNavarone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGunsOfNavarone">The Guns of Navarone</a></em> use silencers that make the gunshots sound closer to a champagne cork popping. Still somewhat loud, but softer than a non-suppressed pistol.
</li><li> <em>Sword of Gideon</em> (1986). The Mossad assassination team uses .22 Beretta's with underpowered cartridges which only make a <em>fumph!</em> sound, lampshaded when their instructor teaches the importance of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap">Double Tap</a>. "Always twice — <em>Fumph-fumph</em> never goddamn <em>fumph!</em>"
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LayerCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LayerCake">Layer Cake</a></em>, where a pillow is used to silence a headshot.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildGeese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildGeese">The Wild Geese</a></em>. Suppressed pistols are only used for their intended purpose (eliminating lone sentries away from other people). Acknowledging a suppressor's limits, quieter means (poisonous gas and poisoned crossbow bolts respectively) are used to eliminate soldiers in a barracks and tower sentries.
</li><li> In the spy movie <em>The Jigsaw Man</em> (1983), Michael Caine's character sees a van parked with its rear doors open. Suddenly Caine staggers from a bullet wound, apparently inflicted by a silenced gun fired noiselessly from inside the van.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2">John Wick: Chapter 2</a></em> has John Wick himself and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cassian</span> using silencers so powerful they can have a gunfight with their guns hidden, with bullets bouncing off the walls, while casually walking through a crowded subway station and <em>no one else notices</em> there's a gunfight going on right next to them.
</li><li> At several points in the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackSunday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackSunday">Black Sunday</a></em>, characters use silenced revolvers. Most noticeable when Kabakov interrogates Muzi.
</li><li> In the Hong Kong film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YesMadam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YesMadam">Yes, Madam</a></em>, an assassin kills a target in a hotel, from point-blank range, by using an <em>apple</em> shoved into said target's mouth as a silencer.

<ul><li> Averted nicely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>. A hitman uses a silenced .22 (which Harry specifically mentions uses subsonic ammunition) and says that the silencer makes the shots sound like "someone slapping a heavy dictionary against a desk." The gunshots get louder as the silencer begins to give out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes">Changes</a></em> when someone attempts to assassinate Harry from a passing car. The gunshot sounds are so muffled that, because Harry's duster saves him, no one else even realizes he was being shot at.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jumper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jumper">Jumper</a></em> sequel, Reflex, a silenced pistol shot was described as being similar to someone stepping on a dry twig.
</li><li> In <em>The Chase</em>, a 19th century bank robber doesn't just silence a revolver- <em>he silences it by wrapping a scarf around the muzzle</em>.
</li><li> The espionage novel by David Morrell, <em>Brotherhood of the Rose</em> has the protagonists using the 'Mossad homemade silencer'' designed to be constructed from innocuous materials like washers and glassfibers, assembled for the kill, then broken up and thrown away.
</li><li> Towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></em>, the protagonists infiltrate the State Science Institute to rescue <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> John Galt.</span> They are all equipped with guns which are silenced to the point of not making any sound at <em>all</em> when fired. Not even a single fwip. Then again, the protagonists are a community of "geniuses" that owns all sorts of physically impossible technology, including an entropy reversing motor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather II</a></em> - A young Don Corleone commits his first murder with a revolver wrapped up in a towel to muffle the sound. The towel realistically <em>catches fire</em> due to the muzzle flash.
</li><li> The towel-as-silencer trick also appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BernardSamsonSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BernardSamsonSeries">Bernard Samson Series</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LenDeighton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LenDeighton">Len Deighton</a>. Someone borrows a revolver from Bernard, then returns it wrapped up in a towel. Which has bullet holes and powder burns in it.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a></em> story, the title character recommends that one his friends use a silencer for his gun in a school play so that he won't have to yell "Bang Bang!".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata">A Hymn Before Battle</a></em> - In a fairly rare slip-up regarding firearms, author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a> has an assassin using a silenced Colt .45, with the sound of the shots described as "four rapid huffs", with no one reacting until the targeted people fall into the Reflecting Pool in front of the Washington Monument. Possibly justified in that the assassin was working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Darhel</a>, who could have just engineered a better silencer for the occassion .
</li><li> Averted quite consistently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s novels, which isn't surprising considering the amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a> involved.
<ul><li> John Kelly of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">Without Remorse</a></em> home-builds a suppressor for his Colt .45, but that requires a full-blown Navy machine shop, several years' of special forces experience, and a caliber conversion kit to bring his Colt down to .22 caliber. He later does the same to a bolt-action .22 rifle after a few techniques for suppressing rifles' noises, too. Another scene from the same novel features a Navy chief building a suppressor for his assault carbine on the Boxwood Green mission: the gunfire could "only" be heard out to a hundred yards, as opposed to several hundred unsuppressed.
</li><li> Clancy is also at pains to point out that a silencer does not totally silence the guns, but makes the noise carry less far and, in the case of non-automatic weapons, means that anyone not in the know is more likely to mistake it for something else. Also, he points out that no silencer can stop the occasionally rather loud mechanical noise of the gun cycling, which, thanks to Hollywood, people don't mistake for harmless noise.
</li><li> Played completely straight at least in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a></em> where a special forces operative uses a silenced sidearm to quickly dispatch six insurgents sleeping in a small cave. None of them wake up in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Professional Killers</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JTEdson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JTEdson">J.T. Edson</a>, one of the killers uses a silenced revolver. This is an odd slip-up from Edson who was usually meticulous in his firearms research.
</li><li> Averted by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a></em> books, which tend to describe a silenced shot as sounding like a "cough" or similar.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> averts the trope, showing suppressed pistols as making 'pop pop' noises. It goes even further, making the characters put their hands over their ears when shooting off a lock in an enclosed space with the same pistols.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>: An episode had an improvised silencer made by taping an empty two liter of soda to the front of a pistol. No one in the building was able to hear the gun shots.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> had an aversion of this trope as a plot point. The victim was killed with a gun fired through a potato (with the intent of silencing it), which Goren noted wouldn't work. When the same MO shows up later, the fact that the killer didn't realise it didn't work the first time (along with the fact he panicked and killed the victim even though she couldn't call for help) proves that they were deaf.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>
<ul><li> An episode featured a coke bottle silencer. Another had a potato silencer. While neither would work for more than a few shots, the Coke bottle would be more effective after the first, having a much greater surface-to-volume ratio.
<ul><li> The potato was used for two gunshots, and it <em>worked.</em> Not because it actually silenced the shot, but because the target is deaf.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> had a <em>teddy bear</em> used as a silencer for a large Desert Eagle pistol.
</li><li> Inverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em>, where the title character uses a <em>loudener</em> in one episode. As if his .44 Magnum wasn't loud enough already. Amusingly enough, devices that increase the loudness, or at least direct more of the sound back at the user, do exist; they're called "muzzle brakes," and their main purpose is to reduce recoil by redirecting the muzzle flash upwards or backwards or some other direction that runs counter to the regular recoil impulse.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>. Guns with silencers still make noise, and it's more of a realistic 'crack' than it is a 'thwip', and at one point was shown to be audible through a flight of stairs and a closed door. Played straight in other parts of <em>Chuck</em>, most notably when Casey practices shooting pictures of bin Laden and Hitler with a silenced gun inside his own apartment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart">Get Smart</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode features a villain using a silencer on a <em>cannon.</em>
</li><li> In another episode Smart had to make a call on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoePhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoePhone">Shoe Phone</a> during a gun battle, but the operator could not work because his gun was too loud, forcing him to install his silencer.
</li><li> More prosaically (and not for comedic purposes), "silenced revolvers" are used frequently on the show.
</li></ul></li><li> The second season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> employs this when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jax shoots A.J. Weston in the tattoo parlor</span>.
</li><li> Averted indirectly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>, in which the detectives work out that in order to murder a man in the middle of Grand Central Station without being heard, a killer must have not only used a silencer, but also waited until a train was passing. And despite these precautions, someone still heard him.
</li><li> Subverted in the season three finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>, where Mike uses a gun with a silencer to murder several cartel members selling meth on Gus's territory without permission. Only the gun is <em>far</em> from silent.
<ul><li> Though a lack of a gun blast is played straight, the casings hitting the wall/floor and the operation of the pistol are clearly heard.
</li></ul></li><li> Even though it abandons many other ridiculous tropes in favour of realism; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> chooses to play this straight with Chris and Snoop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> tested the Hollywood silencer, and found that while it didn't make the classic film "thwip" sound, they did lower the volume considerably, into more of a thud of similar volume, and declared it "Plausible."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em>: In "The Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case", the killer uses a silenced <em>revolver</em> to kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a>. The shots are quiet enough that a house full of witnesses downstairs cannot hear them, and he later uses squibs to fake the sound of gunshots to make it appear the murder had occurred later than it had.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ColumboS03E03" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ColumboS03E03">Candidate for Crime</a>" features a silenced revolver. And it was a crucial plot point as well, since the bad guy used his silenced revolver to get off a shot without anyone hearing, then later used a firecracker to trick witnesses into thinking the shot came at a later time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> also uses the "kills with a silenced gun, tricks people with a firecracker later" plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MonkS7E5MrMonkIsUnderwater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MonkS7E5MrMonkIsUnderwater">Mr. Monk Is Underwater</a></em>. In this case, the silencer is an empty soda bottle over the end of the barrel, which would be highly ineffective - especially in a very small room, and especially <em>on a submarine</em>, known for having lots of tightly enclosed spaces.
</li><li> Averted in the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a></em>; Cobb uses a sniper rifle fitted with what appears to be a silencer, but it still makes a fairly loud noise when he fires it.
</li><li> In possibly one of the worst offenses ever, during the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em>, an assassin from The Company is sent after Lincoln Burrows and his family. The assassin breaks in and shoots one of Lincoln's father's bodyguards with a silenced pistol. No one could hear the gunshot (or the body hitting the floor), but apparently Lincoln's ears are so good that he could hear <em>the shell hitting the floor</em> from the other side of the (huge) house instead of the gunshot.
</li><li> Silenced pistols in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> make the standard soft *Fwip!* sound. In one episode, a character uses a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welrod">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> pistol, which is almost silent when used.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterOffTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterOffTed">Better Off Ted</a></em>, Veronica keeps a silenced pistol in her office for stress relief that when fired makes a light *Thwip* sound. It is implied that she does this frequently without anyone noticing.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> had these in several episodes, including "Brig Break" and "Hemlock".
</li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> gives several characters homemade suppressors constructed from flashlights and baseball bats.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreenHornet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreenHornet">The Green Hornet</a></em> called "The Silent Gun" featured...a silent gun. When fired, the gun made practically no noise. It's explained in the story that the pistol was an experimental wartime model, fired very small caliber rounds, and was only effective at close range.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans">NCIS: New Orleans</a></em>, a silencer made from a 2-liter soda bottle and rags is used to silence a pistol. The noise does not wake the woman sleeping the in same room as the victim, but she was at a frat party and so was likely drunk. The party itself was loud and so would also have served to mask the sound.

When burglar Wilkins is cornered by three policemen in a library, he draws a gun on them, but as they have been repeatedly shushed by the librarian and the other library patrons, he first screws a silencer onto the barrel. When he fires the gun, it makes <em>no noise at all</em>. The policemen have to spend a few seconds determining which of them has been shot.

All of them <em><strong>completely</strong></em> debunk the "Hollywood Silencer" myth. Also, these <em>actual</em> gunsmiths are quite satisfied with final numbers in the 130 db range.

The gun modifications make the gun capable of longer ranges, but the switch in ammunition to one that doesn't ignite a rocket engine behind the bullet just after firing is what silences the gun.

The shots are still clearly audible to a human player in multiplayer so long as all the <em>other</em> guns and explosions don't drown it out, however; the only concrete advantage to putting a suppressor on a weapon there is that you won't appear on the enemy's minimap when firing it, though the weapon's damage at range is also reduced.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em>, three weapons do appear on the radar in multiplayer even with a suppressor (the M9, MG4, and M240). However, this is due to either a glitch or the programmers missing the issue (other similar issues exist, such as the Desert Eagle's sights not lining up correctly, or the F2000's unique Red Dot Sight not being shut down by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">EMP</a>), not an intended feature.

Oil filters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">can actually work as improvised suppressors</a>, but as with the effectiveness of regular ones the game wildly exaggerates their abilities - even if they will fit onto the threading of your gun's barrel, they're not designed to take that kind of pressure and will blow out after a handful of shots, plus their sheer size means that they completely block the ironsights.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> where close proximity to an enemy makes your stealth pistol audible. Very noticeable in the "Rescue Tiffany" mission. Tiffany is typically toast.
<ul><li> Further averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Human Revolution</a></em>, as even silenced weapons generally take a good distance or a wall to keep from alerting enemies, and you cannot put a silencer on the revolver.
</li></ul></li><li> In the N64 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye</a></em>, no guards would respond to silenced gun fire no matter how close they were to you. Amusingly enough, the guards wouldn't even respond to <em>other</em> guards firing <em>their</em> weapons at you, which often included incredibly loud assault rifles and submachine guns. Apparently, invading superspies intruding into the base is such a common occurrence that the guards can only be bothered to deal with it when they actually <em>see</em> the intruder.
<ul><li> Note also that a single tap of the trigger is apparently inaudible too. They could <em>only</em> notice multiple gunshots in a burst; a single shot from any weapon (with the possible exception of the shotguns, which fired multiple projectiles per trigger pull) would count as totally stealthy no matter how loud the weapon itself, provided no enemy saw the shot impact.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> did this a bit differently. Guards would notice if you fired the gun, so long as you were close enough or fired it multiple times. "Close enough", however, generally means "same room". This got complicated in more open levels, where enemies would either be able to hear you from the other end of the map, or arbitrary sound cutoffs would stop enemies hearing you ten feet away in one direction but not thirty feet away in another. <em>Perfect Dark Zero</em> went full-on for this trope, however, with the rules for detection instead mattering on whether anyone sees your target drop, hears the bullet hitting something, or finds a body on their patrol route. Particularly jarring in one level filled with spider-bots that will, if you don't take care of them by other means, come after you in large numbers and blow you up if you make <em>any</em> noise within the areas they're in - firing a burst from your silenced SMG to ventilate the guy manning their control panel, standing just five feet away from one of said spider-bots, evidently doesn't count.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em> one weapon is a silenced version of the 9mm pistol, more powerful but with a lesser fire rate and held with both hands instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle">Gangsta Style</a> (thus unable to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">paired up</a> when reaching Hitman skill with it). Firing it in a crowded scene does not trigger a pedestrian panic as long as you don't shoot a person or a car's gas cap (tires are fair game). You might even get away with a few kills or car explosions until the first victim registers as dead, then they'll freak out.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> has a silencer as an available weapon mod for every weapon except the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawedOffShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawedOffShotgun">Sawed-Off Shotgun</a>, the Heavy Sniper, machine guns, and heavy weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a> 2</em>, pistol silencers (renamed to suppressors in the fan-made v1.13) will still attract attention from nearby guards, both near you and near the guard you shot. The real "silent" option is hurling a throwing knife at unaware guards' backs and necks, though even that can alert nearby guards if they see the body fall... though if they move away before the kill and return after, they won't notice a thing. Kinda weird, that. v1.13 also introduces a wealth of new "silent" weapons, mostly the subsonic variety like the AS Val assault rifle and VSSK Vychlop sniper rifle, as well as suppressors for assault and sniper rifles which are fairly useless unless you buy specially-made "cold-loaded" subsonic ammo.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> games get this almost right. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">original</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">two</a> games the silencer was just an inventory item that automatically silenced all compatible weapons once you had it, but starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, suppressors became actual attachments for specific weapons, and suppressed weapons make a more realistic "puff" or "crack" sound (the silenced tranquilizer pistol in later games makes more of a "fwip" noise because of its subsonic ammunition), and from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> onwards the suppressors wear out (apart from some integrally-suppressed weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">4</a></em>) and can throw off your aim quite a bit - but you can still fire them inches away from a sentry's head and they won't hear a thing (except on harder difficulties in later games, and they will also hear bullets and darts ricocheting off nearby surfaces). This of course only applies to non-human opponents: Players in <em>Metal Gear Online</em> can hear suppressed gunshots just fine if they're alert enough.
<ul><li> The series, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> onward, also realistically depicts how a more-effectively silenced weapon would actually need to be set up to work properly: the tranquilizer guns have their slides locked and required to be manually racked after every shot. In real life, a properly silenced pistol would have the shot be quieter than the action of the pistol itself (the metallic clack of the slide moving back and forth), so the slide has to be locked to prevent it from working (not that the tranquilizer bullets have the explosive force to work the slide on their own anyway, but that's a different story). Hence the single-shot nature of the gun.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a> 2</em> has a silenced SMG which seems to the player to be only slightly quieter than the pistol. It also seems to be useless, however, since the majority of the game involves head-on attacks with no need for stealth - and given the insane firing rate of the SMG (which releases a five-round burst with a single tap of the Fire button), it seems difficult to believe that any guard would have difficulty locating the shooter if that guard had the ceaseless muffled coughs of a silenced SMG to go off of.
</li><li> Notable aversion: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>'s "Mercenaries" minigame, Albert Wesker packs a pistol with a silencer (the only one of its kind in the entire game). Rather than the stereotypical "pyoo" sound, there is instead the sound of the gun's mechanism cycling and a barely-audible pop, making it one of the more realistic silenced guns sounds of recent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a>: Vegas</em> and its sequel, your character apparently has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> full of silencers that will fit onto the barrels of pretty much <em>any</em> pistol, submachine gun, or assault rifle. You can't silence some handguns, however, and with the exception of the integrally-suppressed SR-25, <em>none</em> of the shotguns, machine guns or sniper rifles can be suppressed either. Your allies also avoid the hyperspace arsenal bit by just switching from their standard assault rifle and machine gun to suppressed MP7s when you tell them to go silent. As for effectiveness, especially considering the cramped quarters it's played somewhat realistically - you may be able to sneak-attack one or two guys, but generally, unless you're taking great care to only shoot people while they're a ways away and out of their buddies' sight, as soon as you shoot one then the rest are going to either hear your shots or see your target go down. The pistols are also an interesting use of this trope, as while the Desert Eagle being un-suppressable is typical Hollywood embellishment (Deagles, being a hunting and target gun in reality, weren't exactly designed to take suppressors barring a specific 10-inch-barreled variant that only arrived in 2018, but you could stick a silencer on it in earlier <em>Rainbow Six</em> games - no one wants to because doing so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">would defeat part of the purpose of using the Deagle</a>), the Raging Bull revolver and the Glock 18C actually can't be suppressed in reality. For the Raging Bull, this is because it's a revolver without any sort of method for sealing the cylinder gap; for the Glock it's because, as the C in its name indicates, there are various compensator cuts in its barrel and slide to redirect gases from the fired bullets upward in an attempt to counteract recoil - the muzzle flash and report escape <em>before</em> the suppressor can do anything about them.
<ul><li> In the original game and <em>Rogue Spear</em>, silencers were only available for pistols and specific primary weapons, usually submachine guns like the MP5. In <em>Raven Shield</em>, which switched to a system for attachments that could go onto most guns, almost any gun could be fitted with a silencer. In any case, every suppressed weapon averted this trope: damage and range were decreased by the use of subsonic ammunition, and nearby enemies could still hear them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal">Postal</a> 2</em> you could grab cats, shove the end of the shotgun or assault rifle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove">up their ass</a>, and shoot the gun with the characteristic "fwip" silenced noise, accompanied with a progressively-higher-pitched meow from the cat until it eventually flies off the end of the barrel and dies after nine shots. Do remember that nothing in that game is supposed to be taken seriously. This was also done in the Postal movie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">The cat was fine too</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> series tends to play this straight, with optional silencers on pistols, rifles and submachine guns turning the noise into the usual 'thwip' without degrading weapon performance - though depending on the game you can use less effective silencers that only limit the sound instead of removing it.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Blood Money</a></em> offers accessorizing 47's custom guns with a "Type 1" silencer, which works best with whatever low-velocity ammo is offered for the gun (and even then, is noisy), or the "Type 2," which had full Hollywood effectiveness even for "Magnum" ammo. You can even fit your sniper rifle or assault rifle with the "Type 2" model, though there's little point in that because the second you're seen carrying one enemies go on high alert.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin">Silent Assassin</a></em> had five suppressed weapons, each with a suitably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">A.K.A.-47</a>-ish name. Of them, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMT_Hardballer">Baller SD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was massively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">overpowered</a>, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HK_MP5">SMG-SD6<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was fairly useful for mook-sweeping due to having the highest magazine capacity among suppressed weapons, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruger_MK_II">.22 SD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleUselessGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleUselessGun">so weak</a> that sometimes <em>not even a headshot was fatal</em> (it's seriously more useful for silently breaking things or deliberately grabbing someone's attention by shooting near them), and the Custom Rifle (custom-modified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Walther WA2000</a>) was audible for at least 20 meters. As for the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_M9">9mm SD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it was probably the most useful weapon in the whole game due to having nice damage, very high magazine capacity for a handgun (15 bullets), easy concealibility and plentiful ammo (guards always carry either this or an assault rifle).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Hitman</em>'s Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> cousin <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathToSpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathToSpies">Death To Spies</a></em> features silenced Nagant revolvers extensively, all of them producing a muffled sound similar to "fwip", but reasonably loud. It <em>can</em> alert nearby guards, especially on higher difficulty settings. Silenced rifles in the game are generally more guilty of this trope. For the silenced Nagant revolver, take a look at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em> has three silenced weapons, one per slot - the primary Silenced MP5, the secondary Silenced Makarov 6P9, and the special Dart Rifle. The weapons zig-zag between Hollywood twhipping (Makarov and Dart Rifle) or more realistic (MP5), but the rules for detection are a bit more realistic - the thwipping still puts enemies on alert, just without revealing your exact location unless the round goes whizzing past someone's head.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em> and on play the trope very straight, allowing the same model of Hollywood silencer to attach to almost every weapon with no apparent downsides, other than that the player has to choose between that or another attachment like a better sight or an extended magazine. Particularly jarring is that none of the weapons have unique suppressor models - the tiny 9x18mm 6P9 and the massive .50 BMG Z93 sniper rifle can fit the same suppressor model, and it's just as effective on both of them. The same rules for detection as in <em>2</em> apply, however - the only true silent long-range kill is the recurve bow or its alternates in later games. Enemies can get a pretty good approximation of where you shot from if they see someone die to your silenced gun, though if you shoot someone out of view of the rest of the group and they stumble upon the body later, they'll only be more alert in their patrolling.

Most enemies will notice the suppressed sound, unless they are standing very far away, or the sound is drowned out by heavy machinery. <em>Pandora Tomorrow</em> also makes note of the necessity to slow down the bullet to reduce the sound signature, as the Jerusalem level has you acquiring the F2000 from a local gunsmith who was asked to modify it to make it more silent, only for him to note he wasn't able to make much of a change without reducing the accuracy or power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCellConviction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCellConviction">Conviction</a></em> went the other direction: suppressed weapons are impossible for enemies to hear, even a suppressed fully automatic assault rifle you're laying on the trigger with from five feet away. However, if you're shooting more than two bullets from <em>anything</em>, you're going to be spotted unless you kill the targets you're shooting at. Taken to fully ridiculous levels when, through pre-order bonuses, you can acquire a suppressed SPAS-12 semi-automatic <em>shotgun</em>, and still retain the shotgun qualities of the weapon (bullet spread, etc.).
</li></ul></li><li> Partially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon">Ghost Recon</a></em> in which suppressed weapons have realistic sounds but are inaudible from more than a few feet away. However, one of the silenced guns, the MP5, sounds like hair scissors.
<ul><li> <em>Future Soldier</em> changes the rules for sound detection around, where if you use a silenced weapon to shoot someone, if you kill them in one shot and none of his buddies see or hear the body drop (why the sound of a body hitting the ground is louder than the gunshot that put it there is a question for another day) or end up passing by it later, they won't notice regardless of distance. If you don't make that one-shot kill, though, you're generally going to get detected - if you missed, he'll notice the bullet passing by him and try to alert his comrades. Take more than one bullet to kill him and his buddies will generally hear or at least notice something and investigate, at which point they're likely going to find the body, unless you can kill them before that without anyone else seeing.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> for the Sega Genesis, the silencer only gives the benefit of not setting off the alarms when you fire your weapons inside corporate offices. Every NPC will still hear you firing your gun regardless of being equipped with a silencer or not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em> features the M7S and the M6C/SOCOM, a sound suppressed sub-machine gun and pistol (respectively). They do not sound realistic and Bungie attests that they simply followed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, seen in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRFfYoLm-QA">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While the actual gun noises are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">The Coconut Effect</a>, the enemies' reactions to the firing of a silenced weapon are realistic. Especially on Legendary, the enemies are still very likely to notice you even if you one-shot a Grunt in a secluded area with a silenced weapon. Funnily enough, the Behind-The-Scenes video released before <em>ODST</em> revealed they actually made the guns sound <em>louder</em> than usual before release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em> allows you to add a silencer to your basic loadout weapons in Warzone; they do muffle the sound of gunfire somewhat, but their main gameplay benefit is reducing your visibility on enemy motion trackers when firing.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany">Battlefield: Bad Company</a> 2</em>  the two silenced semi-auto sniper rifles are completely silent, even if an enemy player is right next to you, and you fire past them, they can't tell where it is coming from until you hit them. The silencers on the submachine guns are fwippy, too. The gunshot sounds in that game are generally pretty accurate with echo and resonance, too.
<ul><li> Taken to parodying lengths with the DICE-only weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em>. One of them is a .44 Magnum  a revolver, mind  with a silencer that actually works.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> plays realistic takes on this one on-and-off: the first game has the silencer reducing the sound to a rather realistic muffled bang, whereas <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorAlliedAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorAlliedAssault">Allied Assault</a></em> has a silenced pistol where almost all the sound comes from manually working the slide after each shot. Either way, shooting it will cause Nazis within a short distance to notice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em>: A large number of the weapons in the trilogy can have a silencer attached (and any silencer you find are said to come with adapters and will fit <em>any</em> weapon that can take one - removing one from a dead person's 9mm pistol and attaching it to your 5.45mm AK is fair game) with a tradeoff on accuracy and power, and a few have integrated suppressors, either by design or because they were modded by their owners; the latter are unique guns whose suppressors don't have the normal drawbacks. While the type of sound varies from the Hollywoodian 'fwip' to simply a more muted report, the effects are the same: it doesn't make the gun completely inaudible, but it does reduce and alter the noise so that it alerts enemies in a much smaller radius, and confuses them as to where it came from.
</li><li> Zig-zagged with Roblox's <em>Phantom Forces</em>. The sounds vary depending on the weapon, with small caliber guns like the TEC-9 and G18 having almost inaudible 'pfh', to the 5.56 family having more distinctive 'ti' sounds, and snipers having average 'thmph' sounds, with the M107 being quiet enough to hear the gun action cycling. It's distictive feature, however, is the fact that different suppressors have different "masking ranges" on the radar. Other players outside the range won't detect the weapon firing at all on the radar, but the radars for enemies inside will locate the general position of the source of gunfire via circular pings, without actually pinpointing the exact location of it nor update it in real time. Many weapons also feature unique suppressors for them (the Mac-10's Sionics Suppressor), and integrated suppressors for various weapons.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033">Metro 2033</a></em> games feature a cousin of the Vintorez and Val, the VSK-94 silenced sniper rifle, known as the VSV in-game. <em>2033</em> also has the option to buy suppressed versions of most standard weapons, and these behave more or less realistically: they don't outright give away the character's presence the way an unsuppressed weapon would, but nearby foes will notice the noise and start actively looking for its source if they were previously idle or patrolling. They also (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">realistically</a>) increase the accuracy of the guns they're attached to in exchange for less powerful shots. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight">Metro: Last Light</a></em> keeps those mechanics, but make the silencer an attachment instead of classifying a gun with one in its own market tier. Even shotguns can be suppressed, with a brutal power tradeoff for the lower noise and tighter spread.
</li><li> While the silenced pistol in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em> has a Hollywood-style "fwip" sound, it does not prevent enemies from noticing you<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0b253');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0b253" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0b253');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">any enemies who do ignore your silenced pistol in this game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">would ignore any other weapon of yours too</a></span>. Rather jarring, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the gun is described as having specialized ammunition for stealth purposes</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> plays this trope straight with one exceptionthe Anti-Materiel Rifle variant added in the Gun Runners Arsenal DLC can be suppressed (essentially) but not silenced. Since, after all, it is a .50-caliber sniper rifle which is referred to as a cannon by more than one NPC. The effect is distance-based, as in firing it in someone's ear is quite different from firing it at the limit of the draw distance.
<ul><li> Oddly enough, some of the silenced guns actually <em>sound</em> completely accurate, but NPCs will still ignore the rather loud sounding shot.
</li><li> It also averts this in one other case: a Varmint Rifle with the suppressor modification will be ignored by enemies other than the one you shoot (if he survives or you miss by a small enough margin), but the unique Ratslayer variant, which comes with the same modification, will alert enemies near your target. This is technically a bug, although it does make sense anyway  the Ratslayer is coded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">remove body parts with killing shots</a> (the Varmint Rifle is not, since it was originally coded to use the tiny and weak .22 LR ammo, and nobody changed the gibbing rules for it when it was upchambered to 5.56), which would naturally be louder and more suspicious than someone just dropping normally. Then again, the larger-caliber sniper rifle can also accept a suppressor, will also lop off body parts with killing shots, but is still ignored by enemies near your target.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> includes suppressors as an upgrade for some of its weapons, which make it harder for unaware enemies to tell where you're shooting from. Likely in reference to <em>Red Faction</em> above (sharing the same developer), the suppressors actually make the weapons they attach to <em>more</em> accurate and powerful, without any explanation.
</li><li> The tutorial voice-over in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever">No One Lives Forever</a></em> says that "silence is a relative term when it comes to guns". The silencer still makes guns pretty damn quiet for stealth purposes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> downplays this. Silenced guns make the fwip sound, but are still very loud. Silencers are only used to mask the direction from where the gun was fired.
</li><li> Some video games, likely due to not enough attention paid, actually invert this  <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, for instance, features an integrally suppressed MP5 which neither sounds like or is treated as though it is suppressed<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14o4a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14o4a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14o4a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Its first-person model is suppressed, at least - the third-person model is not.</span>.
</li><li> Averted in, of all games, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> where one of the starting weapons you can find is a MAC-10 with an attached suppressor. It still sounds pretty loud, but at the same time regular infected will take a while longer to realize you're firing at them with it. But what's the point of stealth in a game that is basically a run and gun against hordes of zombies?
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em>, where enemies can tell when you're shooting with silenced weapons but will have a harder time locating you. The tradeoff is that the bullets have <em>massive</em> damage falloff, to the point where soldiers will become more or less invulnerable against silenced rounds past a certain distance.
</li><li> Played straight in <em>Crysis 2</em> where a silencer can reduce the sound of a large pistol to a tiny click. Enemies are still alerted by this sound, though; the main benefit comes from not breaking out of stealth mode. Amusingly, the silencer works just as well when placed at the end of the shotgun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SniperEliteV2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SniperEliteV2">Sniper Elite V2</a></em> features the Welrod pistol, with its integral suppressor, which makes the classic "cat sneeze" sound when fired. Enemies <em>do</em> hear you miss them, though. This is a little more acceptable than most examples  the real Welrod was designed to be as quiet as possible, and is about as "silent" as guns get (which, understand, is still not very silent at all).
</li><li> The "Citadel" DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> adds a heavy pistol that features an integrated suppressor. How the M-11 silences itself is somewhat of a mystery considering that guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> don't use chemical explosives (real suppressors work by allowing propellant gases to expand differently), but accelerate rounds with gravity fields instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSaboteur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSaboteur">The Saboteur</a></em> plays this very straight with two weapons in the game. A silenced pistol that resembles a Walther PPK, and a "Viper" submachine gun that has a built in silencer. Both weapons can be used for absolute stealth as long as no Nazi sees you firing it. Bodies dropping do cause panic and soldiers to investigate the area, but after they conclude they can't find anyone nearby, they resume normal operations and you can use the same tactic again to very useful effect. Civilians never react. Even if you are killing civilians... with loud guns! Though Nazis will react to both if they see/hear it.
<ul><li> Even more ridiculous (and awesome) is shooting someone through a metal grated floor from below. Nazi's apparently cannot see through the floor so you can end up killing one guard right next to another and they will not call for reinforcements right away (until they investigate the body).
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> trilogy use chirping silenced weapons, but the later games have more realistic-sounding suppressors that close-enough enemies can hear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em> did it realistically. There is exactly one silenced firearm in the game and it is soundless, but that firearm is a custom-made, purpose-built gun with an integrated silencer.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a> 2</em>. Silencers, for the most part, simply change the noise of a gun to something less distinct along with the added benefit of silenced weapons not showing up as blips on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyDetectingRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyDetectingRadar">Enemy-Detecting Radar</a>. However, some guns lose almost all of their noise - the Terran Republic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">TRAP-M1</a> scout rifle is almost totally silent when fired, except for clicking of the burst fire mechanism.
</li><li> The semi-automatic pistols in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider (2013)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a></em> both have silencer upgrades that sound very similar to how they do in real-life, though the sound effect is of course still much quieter than a real suppressed gunshot (even moreso here, as Lara's pistol is a Colt .45 1911, a very loud gun).
</li><li> Played straighter than a light beam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune">Soldier of Fortune</a> II: Double Helix</em>, almost to the point of exaggeration. The silenced US SOCOM pistol fires more quietly than a falling cloth, enemies die completely silently, and even if they're not hit fatally, they don't react at all to being shot, nor does anyone else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterSpy">CounterSpy</a></em> plays this straight with the Diplomatic Pistol. So long as guards don't see their friends dying, the target doesn't survive the shot and nobody can see you, consider yourself completely hidden.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a> 3</em> Max improvises a silencer out of a plastic water bottle. Somehow, this <em>works</em>, making it a particularly egregious example even by Hollywood firearm standards.
</li><li> Partly averted in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreachAndClear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreachAndClear">Breach And Clear</a></em>, where you can attach suppressors to your rifles. They sound more like firecrackers than like guns, although it takes a little longer for enemies in other rooms to react to your shots (though not to the normal sounds from your enemies shooting back).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> plays this perfectly straight out of necessity. Originally, the game had a proper system for this, where AI would notice and respond to gunshots even from a silenced weapon if you were within a set distance from them. This eventually had to be patched to the usual setup where nobody noticed silenced gunfire right next to them because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDSpace">the engine couldn't determine vertical distances</a> for the silent rules - even in circumstances where nobody would be hearing <em>anything</em> from that room due to how the building itself was set up (say, one or two floors below, with thick walls and the only door facing a different direction), so long as you were within the correct distance as far as a top-down map would be concerned, they'd still react as if you'd fired your gun directly next to their ear. Other aspects are played somewhat realistically, with most suppressors having negative effects to some combination of the weapon's power and accuracy (likely due to the subsonic nature of the ammo, whether it starts that way or the suppressor slows it down) as well as the concealability due to attaching a long and thick cylinder to the end of the barrel; however, these can also be negated with a pair of skills that give bonuses to suppressed weapons, "The Professional" making them more stable and accurate and "Specialized Killing" giving them a damage boost, making suppressors the straight-up best choice to attach to just about any weapon for a player that has both skills.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unturned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unturned">Unturned</a></em>. Zombies won't bat an eye at a silenced gun's report, although the same can't be said of players if you're shooting a gun with the makeshift muffler, as the report is muffled to as lout as a loud 'plack' (proper suppressors lower the report to "footstep on concrete" levels). As an aside, they decrease bullet damage, and if the durability of any kind of suppressor reaches 0, it stops working completely.
</li><li> Done both ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em>. The Sten submachinegun appears to fit this trope, but as noted in the real life section below, the suppressed versions of this gun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">really were that quiet</a> (although the game makes the usual "<em>fft</em>" noise rather than hearing the bolt clattering). On the other hand, played straight with the high powered "Snooper" sniper rifle: it couldn't be that silent while remaining effective at long range due to the subsonic ammunition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories">mods for firearms</a> that reduce the chance of enemies hearing your shots, up to 100%. This means you can make pistols, assault rifles or even <em>shotguns</em> you can shoot at unalerted enemies and miss several times, without ever alerting them to your presence; they will be alerted only if the shot hurts them without killing them, or if they witness a corpse of their comrade. These suppressors hardly reduce the gunshot <em>you</em> hear, meaning your "silent" assassin weapon will still pretty much be a boomstick. The warframe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Banshee</a> can innately make any firearm she holds be silent.
</li><li> Adding a suppressor to a firearm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> turns the sound of a gunshot into a little "Ptchoo." This happens even if the weapon has a vented barrel modification, which would allow the supersonic gasses to exit the barrel before getting to the suppressor.

Its purpose is actually to cut down the blaster's massive recoil rather than making it more silent. It's also kind of a play on the gun's name, putting a <em>silencer</em> on the <em>Noisy</em> Cricket.
</li><li> Honorable mention: One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> plot revolved around "Hushaboom", a silent high explosive.

<ul><li> One episode spoofs of the trope. Marge is using a squeeze-bottle of pancake batter, but gets embarrassed when it makes rude noises and attaches a silencer, changing it to the trademark "phut" sound.
</li><li> Another example in the episode where Homer buys a gun, specifically a revolver, as the salesman informs him about the various accessories on offer.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gun Shop Owner:</strong> Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit. <em>(pulls out a holster)</em> Holster... <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> Oh, yeah. <br/><strong>Gun Shop Owner:</strong> <em>(a belt with several bullets attached)</em> Bandolier... <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> Baby. <br/><strong>Gun Shop Owner:</strong> <em>(a suppressor)</em> Silencer... <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> Mmm-hmm. <br/><strong>Gun Shop Owner:</strong> <em>(what looks like the end of a blunderbuss)</em> Loudener... <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> <em>[drools]</em> <br/><strong>Gun Shop Owner:</strong> <em>(some variety of small hand-crank)</em> Speed-cocker... <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> Ooh, I like the sound of that! <br/><strong>Gun Shop Owner:</strong> <em>(huge device that's much larger than the gun itself)</em> And this is for shooting down police helicopters. <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> Oh, I don't need one of those yet.
</div><ul><li> "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" included a TV special called <em>Springfield's Most Wanted</em>, hosted by John Walsh of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasMostWanted">America's Most Wanted</a></em>. While listing suspects, Walsh says that "[Principal] Skinner had a silencer, yet the gun was clearly audible during the shooting," meant to imply that this dismissed Skinner as the culprit.
</li></ul></li><li> Inexplicably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> played this trope straight and then averted it in the same episode. A silenced pistol is so quiet that nobody even notices anything until blood starts spreading on Stephanie's dress. Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diane Simmons</span> is about to kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lois</span> (with an unsilenced weapon), you hear a bang, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diane</span> drops dead, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stewie</span> is seen with a smoking sniper rifle, which clearly has a silencer. Interestingly, the guns work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">exactly as they need to for each scene to work.</a>
<ul><li> The played straight example can be argued. The silenced pistol was fired at the same time that Brian popped the cork on a champagne bottle, and given that every pistol that ever shows up in this series is drawn exactly the same, there's no telling what kind of bullet it fired or if it was even supersonic. So it is possible that the gunshot was either covered up by or mistaken for the pop of the cork.

<strong><span class="asscaps">Real Life Notes</span></strong>
<ul><li> It is entirely possible to create a truly "silent" weapon, but the major performance tradeoffs required tend to make them rare in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Requirements include: a purpose-built integrally-suppressed design<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24l9i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24l9i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24l9i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Screw-on "muzzle cans" either aren't efficient enough, or are too fragile for more than a handful of shots</span>, lower-powered subsonic ammo<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3a398');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3a398" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3a398');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Supersonic bullets produce the "crack" of a mini sonic boom</span>, and a single-shot or bolt-action<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4m7g5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4m7g5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4m7g5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Automatics produce noise as the bolt forcefully clacks back and forth</span>. This leaves the sound of the bullet striking the target as the only audible product. What you tend to end up with is a cumbersome, low-powered, short-ranged rifle with a very low rate of fire: real (as the examples below indicate), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">of limited usefulness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">not exactly Hollywood material</a>. Most people who have a need to lower their weapon's sound signature these days typically straddle a line between "totally silent but slow and short-ranged" and "totally noisy but powerful and long ranged".
</li><li> The most important thing is not silencing the weapon to a <em>fwip</em>, but changing the noise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">to resemble less closely the sound of actual gunfire</a>. Once the supersonic <em>crack</em> is dispensed with by using subsonic ammo, a suppressor's primary benefit is in making it harder to identify or locate the noise it does produce. In a noisy urban environment, cars and heavy trucks running around, people talking or shouting, TV sets adding to the noise, a muted "pop" could go unnoticed as long as witnesses can mentally dismiss it as some common, incidental noise: somebody dropping an object, a door closing, etc.
</li><li> Ever since the 2019 Virginia Beach shooting, which was committed by a disgruntled city employee using a suppressed .45 handgun, news outlets have been incorrectly reporting that a suppressed gunshot is "as loud as a nail gun". In reality, it is about 125 decibels, slightly louder than thunder.
</li><li> For most people, the main point is not "silencing" the shot at all, but rather reducing it to a volume less likely to induce deafening, particularly when firing in tight quarters (indeed, one of the early reasons for the US Army's interest in them was to keep trainee soldiers <a class="urllink" href="https://armourersbench.com/2018/11/11/springfield-m1903-with-a-maxim-silencer">from flinching when they fired their rifles for the very first time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/01/09/progressives-dont-understand-how-gun-silencers-work-here-are-some-facts-to-help-them/">More than a few gun-control-advocating politicians have fallen prey to this trope.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One wonders about their grades in physics class...
</li><li> This trope may have sent some people to prison since there have been cases of killers convicted by trace evidence of improvised silencers they wrongly assumed they needed — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TelevisionIsTryingToKillUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TelevisionIsTryingToKillUs">possibly by exposure to too many movies</a>. Real hitmen do not often use silencers, as they affect accuracy and are just one more item to be disposed of after the deed that can be potentially traced back to them.
</li><li> Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, seems to have been a victim of this trope. In a <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130910061946/http://www.kk.org/streetuse/archives/weapons/">diary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he expressed disappointment that his homemade silencer "only" reduced the noise of a pistol to about one-third. If his diary is accurate, then his homemade silencer must actually have been better-crafted than most.
</li></ul><p><strong><span class="asscaps">Real Life Silenced Weapons</span></strong>
</p><ul><li> One of the few designs that has enough features to be fairly called "silent" is the .45 ACP British <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLisle_carbine">DeLisle Carbine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of WWII, which featured a bolt-action and a barrel that was basically a single huge suppressor. The heavy, subsonic .45 ACP round was a good choice for a suppressed caliber, and the only sounds produced by firing would be the miniscule *click* of the trigger dropping the hammer, followed by whatever sound the bullet made hitting the target. If a fast follow-up shot was not necessary, the bolt-action could be slowly and carefully operated in such a way that it produced no real noise. Unfortunately, the trade off was in practical usefulness; the DeLisle was great for eliminating lone sentries (if you were close enough to attempt a headshot), but silently dropping a guy within eye or earshot of his friends would ensure you'd only get off one round before his buddies raised the alarm, and the DeLisle was definitely not a weapon you'd want to be carrying once anybody started shooting back at you.
<ul><li> The Welrod pistol was a similar design, only in handgun format.
</li><li> There was also a version of the (in)famous Mk II Sten gun with an integrated suppressor, which was much less quiet than the De Lisle but capable of rapid fire... if you were extremely careful not to touch the barrel shroud, which got hot enough to cause quite serious burns in the time it took to fire a burst of three rounds, and the only handguard was a strip of canvas wrapped around it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Heckler &amp; Koch MP5SD submachine gun has been the gold standard for Western made suppressed weapons since the 1980s. It uses a highly effective internal suppressor system that reduces the report of the normally-supersonic 9mm round to virtually nothing while also slowing it down (via a series of internal rubber "wipes") to subsonic levels; unfortunately, it's also fully-automatic, and thus produces a distinctive "chattering" noise akin to a typewriter that reinforces the idea that you can't make a truly silent automatic weapon. The rubber wipe system also means you can't use anything other than full-power 9mm in it, and the whole system needs to be sent back to the factory for refurbishment every 500 rounds. Lastly, it's less accurate, less powerful and shorter ranged than the normal MP5.
<ul><li> The H&amp;K SMG program to upgrade the MP5 in the 80s was meant to work together with a suppressor as well. It wasn't a dedicated, integral one but rather one that screwed onto the barrel. To aid its effectiveness both prototypes had either a nozzle or a selector-type switch to modify the gas system and choose how much of the gas went into propelling the bullet; if you needed silent shooting, you turned down the gas, and if you needed longer range you turned it back up. How effective the suppressors were on the actual weapons is unknown.
</li></ul></li><li> The now rather famous VSS Vintorez sniper rifle (and its fully-automatic siblings the AS Val and SR-3 Vikhr) uses other special purpose cartridges, the 9x39mm SP-5 and SP-6 (AP). The rifle has a highly effective integral suppressor similar in concept to the MP5SD. Combined with low-velocity rounds using a heavy steel-core bullet, it is both capable of penetrating military-grade body armor and is silent enough to make its operation the loudest part of the report. But, owing to the semi-automatic action, it is <em>still</em> not "Hollywood Silent", and gives a report similar to a BB gun as well as a metallic <em>clank</em> as the bolt moves forward and back. Its subsonic and suppressed nature also gives it a lower effective range than other dedicated sniper weapons, at only about 400 meters (barely further than the effective range for a regular assault rifle), meaning it's used for counter-insurgency operations in urban areas, where getting to take a shot from further than a city block or two is a rare occurrence.
</li><li> The double-barreled MSP and self-loading PSS are small concealed-carry pistols designed around the SP-3 and SP-4 cartridges. These rounds do not let the gases escape the cartridge casing at all (a short-stroke piston pushes the bullet out, containing the pressure). The PSS was also designed to lower cycling noise with a sophisticated mechanical recoil dampener. This results in (supposedly) perfect Hollywood Silencer effect (and makes ejected shell casings a hazard for handling). The MSP is undoubtedly the more "silent" of the two, but must be reloaded manually after every second shot, and both the MSP and PSS suffer from reduced range and accuracy compared to normal military pistol calibers.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K73kKODFyzw">Here is a video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the PSS, "developed for special personnel of the Soviet KGB, as well as for elite elements of the Spetsnaz of the Soviet Army."
</li></ul></li><li> The PBS-1, the sound suppressor for the AKM assault rifle, used together with subsonic 7.62x39mm ammo, suppresses the sound of a shot effectively enough. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDjt85IyWhY">Can be seen and heard here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The Beretta XM9 was an attempt at recreating the idea behind the Mk 22 "Hush Puppy" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, e.g. a custom pistol with a purpose-built suppressor and a slide-locking mechanism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ForgottenWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ForgottenWeapons">Ian McCollum</a> looks at one <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQPsf_wDbmU">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The suppressor together with the slide-lock is demonstrated to have been highly effective at what it does, reducing the noise almost to the stereotypical "fwip" for at least the first few shots, and as Ian notes, the slide-locking mechanism technically made it more reliable with that suppressor than it would have been otherwise,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5nb5m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5nb5m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5nb5m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most handguns, especially in the modern day, have a mechanism involving a moving barrel, whether simply back-and-forth like the Beretta or even tilting upwards to unlock as on just about everything else - a large and heavy suppressor on the muzzle end can and will interfere with that movement, often jamming the gun and requiring the user to manually cycle it. The XM9 sidestepped that problem by locking the slide entirely.</span> but it also made it cumbersome in any use case beyond having a single sentry or guard dog to take care of from a couple meters, and it relied on several rubber wipes in the suppressor which the first bullet would punch a hole through, later ones gradually widening that hole and ultimately hindering its effectiveness to the point that the wipes would need to be replaced after only 25 shots.
</li></ul><p><strong><span class="asscaps">Real Life Silenced Revolvers</span></strong>
</p><ul><li> There are a couple of revolver designs that have a sealed cylinder. The most famous is the Nagant M1895 (see <a class="urllink" href="http://world.guns.ru/handguns/double-action-revolvers/be/nagant-mle-195-e.html">guns.ru<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagant_M1895">Wikipedia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Note that you don't see many followers: this solution made the Nagant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> with its heavy trigger pull, slow reload and lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">traditional revolver advantages</a> due to its complicated mechanism and relatively weak cartridge. Revolvers with this design, or similar, can be suppressed. Check it out <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvF4yurWSc0">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Note that most Hollywood-silenced revolvers are <em>not</em> these models, however.
<ul><li> A less well-known example is the Knight's Armament Revolver Rifle: a Ruger Super Redhawk modified with a suppressed barrel and firing specialized .30-caliber bullets.
</li><li> An extremely rare example is the Smith &amp; Wesson / AAI Quiet Special Purpose Revolver (QSPR), also called the "tunnel revolver." Designed for use by "tunnel rats" - soldiers of small stature who squeezed into Viet Cong tunnels - the QSPR is a heavily modified .44 Magnum. The QSPR was modified by S&amp;W into a short-barreled, smooth-bore weapon in order to fire AAI's custom .40 caliber QSPR rounds. It was basically a .40-caliber shotgun, with each round filled with 15 small tungsten balls. It was only lethal out to about 30 feet, which was sufficient for the cramped tunnels, and was about as loud as a traditionally-suppressed .22 pistol. It also had no sights, since it was meant to be used at point-blank range. Not many were made; somewhere between 25 and 250. In this case, the suppressor was added not for covert purposes, but in order to avoid destroying the firer's eardrums when discharged in such a cramped environment.
</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><span class="asscaps">Real Life Other</span></strong>
</p><ul><li> There actually exists a cannon silencer, or more precisely <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/10/16/worlds-largest-gun-suppressor/">a sound suppressor used on an artillery firing range to make accommodations to nearby residents.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In this case, it doesn't so much reduce the noise, but to channel the sound into the air and away from people. The rather... <em>phallic</em> appearance was probably unintentional.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6p3uv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6p3uv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6p3uv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It used to be the page image on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudWasRight">Freud Was Right</a>.</span>
</li><li> Some specials operations forces still use crossbows in limited roles because they are almost totally silent. Of course, they have all the problems that one would expect of a silent weapon: low power and low rate of fire. They compensate somewhat for the former by having ammunition with sharpened points, which improves penetration, thus also making them more effective against typical kevlar-weave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofVest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofVest">bulletproof vests</a>.
