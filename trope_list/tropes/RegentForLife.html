Regent Charlie is appointed to rule the land in her stead. This is a plum position with all the perks of royalty, but it comes with a built-in retirement date. When Princess Alice comes of age, Charlie must turn the country over to her, going in a day from the most powerful man in the kingdom to a mere nobody. But how is that fair? Charlie's been running <em>everything</em>, and he sees no reason to stop now.
</p><p>If King Bob had the foresight (or the time) to choose a regent before his death, he might have appointed a close relative or a senior churchman, hoping their family ties or religious obligations would stop them from intriguing against the true heir. But this seldom works. Nor does appointing a regency council instead of a single person: that just adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">vicious internal politics</a> to the mix.

Perhaps Charlie becomes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> and runs the kingdom through deception, manipulation, or some sort of evil control over Alice. If he's in line for the throne himself, he may become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince">Evil Prince</a>. Other times he'll arrange for Alice to be kidnapped, killed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheIronMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheIronMask">imprisoned</a>, or discredited. In darker stories, he may attempt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">to marry Alice</a>. While such intergenerational political marriages were once common, the Regent's anticipation of the consummation often pushes him over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>. If Charlie is already married, or forbidden to marry, he may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">arrange a marriage between Alice and one of his family</a>. Alternatively, Charlie may try to keep Alice ignorant of ruling and caught up in the pleasures and perks of being a princess — an infantile queen who still needs the regent's wise hand to steer her around.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes Regent Charlie is evil from the start, perhaps even having had a part in killing the old ruler, but other times he becomes corrupted over time by power and the fear of giving it up.
</p><p>Once in a blue moon, the regent is only called Regent because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">the actual King has been gone for a very long time</a>, and the people are (at least theoretically) awaiting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">return</a>. Since nobody wishes to disrespect the title of King, the actual ruler of the country is officially a mere steward, but in practice he is the reigning monarch in all but name.
</p><p>There is also, of course, the possibility that Princess Alice is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">an absolute nightmare</a>, and it is better to keep Charlie the regent and avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen Alice the tyrant</a>. Expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a> and other tropes of this nature to kick in as people question Charlie's legitimacy (which, admittedly, he lacks) and motives (which may well extend beyond altruistic intentions, especially if his struggles have made him cynical). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">This can ultimately</a> lead to a horrible situation where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">both Alice and Charlie are monsters,</a> forcing a third party to step in.
</p><p>A variation of this is when the monarch is permanently incapacitated (such as being comatose, or mentally disabled in some way). In this case, Queen Alice is not so much undesirable as completely <em>unable</em> to rule the nation. But she's still the Queen, and there's no legal way to simply remove her. Thus, Regent Charlie is the only plausible choice to do Alice's job for her. This is usually the most positive depiction of a Regent For Life that you'll see, as Regent Charlie is very likely the next in line to the throne and thus the fact that he doesn't simply have Queen Alice eliminated is a sign of his good moral character.
</p><p>A Queen Mother acting as regent is more likely to act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a>.

While the princess is nominally the leader of Axis-Zeon, Haman is the one who's really in charge (Mineva was roughly eight years old at the time, and had been the nominal head of the otherwise extinct Zabi family since she literally was in diapers) and acts as Mineva's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a>, commander-in-chief of her armed forces, and dictator of Axis in all but name.

Unfortunately, the only one we actually <em>meet</em> in the books and films alike is Denethor, mentally unhinged by the loss of his favorite son, the hordes of Mordor at his doorstep, and finally by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> himself through the seeing-stone which Denethor foolishly thought he could control. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">the movies</a>, possibly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, he and Boromir both make it very clear that "Gondor has no king. Gondor <em>needs</em> no king." In the book, Denethor says, his rule "is mine and no other man's, unless the king should come again" (<em>LoTR</em> V 1). Denethor might be perfectly willing, even overjoyed, to yield to a king, but we never learn whether Denethor would accept Aragorn as the king, considering Gandalf tries to conceal from Denethor the coming of Aragorn. Denethor would have a solid precedent for refusing to give Aragorn the throne: Aragorn's ancestor Arvedui tried to claim the throne of Gondor, and they turned him down. Aragorn isn't a direct male-line descendant of Anárion. He's descended from Anárion's older brother Isildur, who <em>was</em> King of Gondor even though his children weren't, and he also descends from Anárion through his ancestress Fíriel, a daughter of the last king of the senior line of Gondor and wife of Arvedui, so there are arguments to be made both ways.
<ul><li> After Gil-Galad's death, Galadriel and Elrond were the only valid heirs to the title of High King. Neither claimed it, but Elrond ruled as High King in all but name.
</li></ul></li><li> Cersei Lannister in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> becomes regent for her adolescent son, and heads this way.

</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni">Deryni</a></em> series, the regents tamper with the King's will to increase their power, keep his first son permanently drugged until he dies, kill the second son when they discover he's plotting against them, and plan to kill the third son as soon as he provides a heir, threatening to have his wife raped if he doesn't cooperate.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalloreon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalloreon">The Malloreon</a></em>. The King of Drasnia dies, leaving his young son on the throne. The boy's mother becomes regent and is very careful about steadily increasing his responsibilities, so that he'll be ready once she steps down. (It helps that Belgarion, for all intents and purposes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>, is practically the kid's godfather - everyone would want to take over Drasnia with just a boy-king and a woman running it, but <em>nobody</em> will screw with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Godslayer</a>.)
<ul><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> with the Warders of Riva, who have been waiting for their king for several hundred years. Like the Stewards of Gondor, they are hereditary regents, though unlike Denethor, the last one welcomes back his king. One of his sons, on the other hand, was so enraged at seeing his father's power be usurped he tried to kill Garion.
</li><li> An interesting variant occurred in the prequel novels - after Riva's queen Beldaran died, he was too grief-stricken to rule his kingdom. So he declared the crown prince to be his regent and went into seclusion. By the time the king actually died and the regent became king in truth, he'd been away from the public eye for so long that a lot of the peasants in the kingdom were surprised that he had still been alive up to that point.

Installed as regent for her brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Paul's</a> twin children, she becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">possessed</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a> of Baron Harkonnen and plots to have them killed and consolidate the power of the Empire for herself.

</li><li> In Brent Weeks' Night Angel trilogy, the land of Ceura (A fantasy psuedo-japan) is ruled by a regent who is meant to give up his power when a leader emerges bearing the mystical sword of legend. When Lantano Garuwashi (a hero and famed war commander) finds it, the regent plans brings an army to him on the pretext of "testing" the sword's authenticity, actually intending to kill Lantano whether the sword passes the test or not. Finding this out, the Regent's 14 year old son challenges his father to a duel and slays him, then takes the army and swears fealty to Lantano after confirming that yes, he really does bear the sword of legend (If Lantano's sword had failed the test, Lantano would have been executed on the spot).
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarlordChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarlordChronicles">The Warlord Chronicles</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMistmantleChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMistmantleChronicles">The Mistmantle Chronicles</a></em> has King Silverbirch of an island neighboring Mistmantle become regent until his daughter Larch could take the throne. Eventually he goes crazy over a mad lust for silver and tries to have her killed, so Larch is in hiding, waiting for her chance to take the throne back.
</li><li> Prince Thanel tries to set this up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Exile's Valor</a></em> when he discovers that marrying the Queen isn't enough to make him King. It doesn't work, mainly because the Queen's Weaponsmaster figures out what he's up to and stops him.
</li><li> Dion Morgan, Regent of Nuin "for Our Very Present Emergency" in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdgarPangborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdgarPangborn">Edgar Pangborn</a>'s <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DAVY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DAVY">DAVY</a>. It is noted by one of the narrators that the "emergency" started as the accession of an insane hereditary President, but came to mean something like "period lasting from the year Your Excellency got away with it until Your Excellency can decently be kicked out" — which duly happens.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarionZimmerBradley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarionZimmerBradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Darkover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Darkover">Stormqueen</a></em>, when Allart becomes king at the end, he appoints the passed over <em>emmasca</em> heir Felix Hastur as his chief counselor, as Felix is likely to live two or three normal generations, and "perhaps between us we can make something like a king." It seems likely that this grew into the pattern depicted in the novels of post-Recontact Darkover, where we find an Elhalyn king left to "keep the throne warm with his royal backside, which is the most useful part of him", while the current Hastur of Hastur customarily wields all the power.
</li><li> A slightly different version is found in Tappan Wright's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISLANDIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISLANDIA">ISLANDIA</a>, where the King of Islandia is technically regent for Alwin XVII, who was never seen again after a battle centuries before, but who has never been declared dead. Islandia's version of constitutional monarchy came about by this historical accident.
</li><li> Thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, Cao Cao is the iconic example of this in Chinese lore; although he was "only" Chancellor/Prime Minister to Emperor Xian of Han, in practice he was <em>the</em> hegemon of northern China during the Three Kingdoms period until his death (after which his son Cao Pi engineered the emperor's abdication in favor of him).
</li><li> In Fiona Patton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm">The Painter Knight</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> assassinates the ruler, planning to be regent for his heir until things have calmed down and he can kill her off too. She escapes and heads for the protection of a cousin, who becomes her loyal, legitimate regent. The resulting altercation is named the Regents' War.
</li><li> This is Makina Seval's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAssassinsOfTamurin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAssassinsOfTamurin">The Assassins of Tamurin</a></em> — to put her adopted daughter on the throne and then rule the Empire "from behind the dais."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em>: Mara of the Acoma ends up as this, not entirely intentionally. At seventeen she gave up control of her family to her new husband. At nineteen she manipulated said husband into committing ritual suicide, leaving her as regent for their infant son until he became of age (At twenty five - she only became Ruling Lady at seventeen because all other heirs were dead). A few years later her son is murdered and she becomes regent for her second son (by a lover). Then her second son ends up inheriting a different throne and she becomes regent for her daughter (by her second husband). While all evidence suggests she did intend to give up her title when her daughter became of age (Her story ended before Kasuma reached adulthood), she was acting as regent of House Acoma from the age of nineteen until she was in her mid to late fifties.

When the last Galactic Emperor was on his deathbed, he was placed in some sort of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StasisField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StasisField">Stasis Field</a> that left him in what amounts to a permanent state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">Only Mostly Dead</a>. (Much to his irritation, by all accounts.) This caused the line of succession to grind to a halt and left the elected parliament and the President they choose by electoral college as the undisputed rulers of a now <em>de facto</em> republican government. Whether this was an overall improvement is hard to say.

Wrede</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowMagic">Shadow Magic</a></em>, the rulership of Alkyra is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FindersRulers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FindersRulers">dependent on the possession of a magical crown</a>. When the crown is lost, the country is officially ruled for generations by regents, though in practice they're puppet rulers and power actually resides among the lords. When the crown is found and a young mage uses it to save the country from an invading army, the regent promptly abdicates and acknowledges her as the new queen.

Following his assassination, his son, Savirien-Chorak, then became Potentate.

Some time after this, (by no later than the 3rd Era) Potentate had become a reserve title allowed by the Elder Council Charter if no imperial heir could be agreed upon in the event of the line of succession being disrupted, allowing the High Chancellor of the Council to take up most imperial authority as Potentate.

However, by the two year mark of Pelagius' reign, his madness had become too publicly apparent, and Katariah was officially granted regency, holding it until Pelagius' death (at which point she assumed the throne and ruled in her own right in what is widely recorded as one of the most prosperous, peaceful periods of the Septim Empire).

While in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">books</a> the current steward would have been willing to give up the throne despite his mounting insanity (though he might have denied Aragorn as the rightful king, he dies before the question can come up), in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">films</a> Denethor and his son Baromir both declare "Gondor has no king—Gondor needs no king."

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em>, if a ruler is too young or becomes mentally incapable, the game appoints a regent from their court, often a parent or a spouse, but if neither of those are available, it will be a random courtier, though a later patch allows you to choose who will be regent if one is needed. This trope would be impossible for a too-young ruler, as the regency automatically ends when the ruler turns 16 but an incapable ruler's regent could continuing ruling until they die, the ruler dies or are replaced with another regent, making the trope possible in that case.
<ul><li> Indeed, incapable rulers can't refuse their regents' requests due to their incapacity, meaning regents occasionally abuse their control to get favors, such having the rulers grant them titles, which are always from the rulers' own demesne.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">It was once thought</a> that Hatshepsut fit this trope. For a long time, most historians believed that she had maliciously kept the throne from her stepson Thutmose III for thirty years, only allowing him to control the Army while she ran everything else. When she died, the story went, Thutmose immediately destroyed or covered up all of her monuments in an attempt to erase his wicked stepmother from the historical record. However, it's since been discovered that Thutmose didn't destroy any of her monuments until decades after her death, and other historians have pointed out that if Thutmose hadn't liked Hatshepsut being in power, he could have disposed of her the day he reached adulthood, since <em>he controlled the Army</em>. It's now suspected that Thutmose and Hatshepsut were <em>friends and allies</em> who ruled together peacefully, Thutmose conducting Egypt's many military campaigns while Hatshepsut stayed at home and dealt with the domestic matters that the budding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror">Young Conqueror</a> Thutmose didn't care about. As for her name being defaced off her monuments, many historians believe that Thutmose's successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Amenhotep II</a> simply wanted to take credit for building them himself.
</li><li> Another subversion was Ay, the successor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tutankhamun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>, who was thought to have killed Tut and stolen his throne.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII">Richard III of England</a> was the regent for his nephew, the twelve-year-old Edward V, but eventually declared Edward a bastard and himself King.
<ul><li> Allegedly before killing his nephew.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Hundred Years' War, the respective councils of regents (mostly the king's uncles) continued to rule for several years after Richard II of England and Charles VI of France had attained their majority. In the case of Charles VI, better known as Charles the Mad, there even were and are those who suspect that the Duke of Orleans somehow engineered the incidents that led to Charles' mental problems so that he could continue to rule France himself.
</li><li> Before the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, Roger Mortimer was the <em>de facto</em> ruler of England in the name of Edward III, apparently having no intention of giving up that power. This led to increasing tensions between the two, and at the age of 17, Edward managed to take Mortimer prisoner, then have him executed for exceeding his authority.
</li><li> The only ruling queen of the Kingdom of Judah, Athaliah, was regent for her son Ahaziah. She operated as more of a co-ruler with her son and orchestrated the murder of a number of other claimants to the throne.
</li><li> When Edward VI died, his regents tried to put Lady Jane Grey on the throne so they could retain power. It didn't work, or at least not for very long — there's a reason that Jane Grey is referred to as "The Nine Days Queen."
</li><li> The Shoguns of Old Japan were like this trope. The legitimate ruler of everything was officially the Emperor, and the Shogun was more likely than not just a warlord who happened to have the biggest military force around. Officially, the Emperor is under his "Protection" and any act by the Shogun is the Will of the Emperor. Emperors tended to agree. The ones that lived anyway.
<ul><li> This is effectively how the Fujiwara clan controlled Japan. The family provided regents for the Emperor in his minority, continued to serve as powerful advisers through his reign, then often "persuaded" him to abdicate at an early age so they could go on acting as regents to his infant heir.
</li><li> It become something of of a precedent in Japan. When the samurai rebelled against the court and reduced the entire court, emperor as well as the Fujiwara regent, into their figurehead, the shogunal Kamakura government itself was taken over by regents just 7 years after Minamoto Yoritomo had taken the title of shogun. The next 134 years, all shoguns were themselves figureheads, as was the whole imperial court still including the regent for the Emperor...
</li><li> During Hōjō reign, the whole regency business was taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, since shikken was the regent for the reigning shogun, not the emperor himself. And since shogun was kind of regent himself, this leads to a regency for a regency <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">for a regency</a>
</li><li> The Fujiwara also controlled the Emperor because he was himself mostly Fujiwara: the Fujiwara had defeated the Soga clan for the right to marry the Emperor, and after a few generations, the Fujiwara had completely hijacked the Imperial genome (except for the Y chromosome).
</li><li> It was widely believed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> intended to, should he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">somehow have conquered</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFillingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFillingEmpire">the Ming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">Empire</a></em>(!!!), he would've transplanted the Japanese political system to the region — the emperor would move to Nanjing (the Ming capital, as opposed to the Yuan capital of Tatu/Beijing and the Song capital of Kaifeng/Xi'an), Toyotomi's cousin would continue to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent for Life</a>, while Hideyoshi himself would <em>continue</em> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">Just the First Citizen</a> ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent for Life</a> emeritus"). The problem is, Chinese sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent for Life</a> as something not as peaceful an institution... see below.
</li><li> <em>Kampaku</em>, one of the three titles used for Regents for Life in Japan, is in fact a historical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> of sorts—it comes from the example of Huo Guang in China, below, and means the phrase "to present" in that example's context.
</li><li> Tokugawa Ieyasu, who founded the third and last dynasty of Shoguns, came to power after being one of five regents to Toyotomi's infant son. After first defeating his colleagues, he married the younger Toyotomi off to his granddaughter. Still, Toyotomi remained a rallying point for the opposition and he was eventually driven to suicide.
</li><li> Due to the long-standing system of hereditary shoguns, the first Europeans to visit Japan translated "shogun" as "emperor" and "tennō" ("heavenly sovereign", the Japanese title of the emperor) as "high priest". Though quite inaccurate from a literal standpoint, this did fairly well reflect the actual roles of two positions at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> And after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, Miklos Horthy declared himself regent of the Hungarian kingdom. Although the old Habsburg family is still around, the country never got a king again, but not for want of trying: Karl I (the last Austro-Hungarian emperor) had never officially abdicated and traveled twice to Hungary to try to reclaim the throne, only for Horthy's forces to stop him— once being rebuked by Horthy himself in Budapest— due to fears of civil war. <br/><br/>To illustrate how strange this situation was, an old Hungarian joke describes the supposed exchange between an American diplomat and his Hungarian counterpart on the occasion of Hungary's declaration of war on the United States during WWII:
<dl><dd><div class="indent">American: So, I see the official name of your country is the "Kingdom of Hungary". Who is your king? <br/>Hungarian: We don't have a king. <br/>American: Oh. Who is your head of state? <br/>Hungarian: Admiral Horthy. <br/>American: Ah, an Admiral. So, you must have a big navy, then? <br/>Hungarian: No, the Italians took that away from us, but fortunately they are our allies. <br/>American: Well, let's move on to your territorial claims. Do you have any territorial conflicts with any of the Allied powers, which have caused you to declare war against the United States? <br/>Hungarian: No, we don't have borders with any of them. <br/>American: Well, are you involved in any territorial conflicts? <br/>Hungarian: Yes - with Rumania, Slovakia, and Germany. <br/>American: So, you have declared war on them as well? <br/>Hungarian: No, they are our allies. <br/>American: That's crazy! <br/>Hungarian: No, it's the New Order in Europe.
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> One of the reasons why he turned down being king <em>himself,</em> against the wishes of supporters for a Horthy dynasty, was that he thought himself unworthy for the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>. For two consecutive emperors, maybe three. Originally a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor, Cixi rose to become Empress Dowager because she bore the emperor's only son and heir, the Tongzhi Emperor. She conspired with her sister empress (who, as the chief wife of the late emperor, had a better claim to rule as regent for the young emperor, of course she was later completely eclipsed by Cixi) to oust the Regent Council appointed by the late emperor. When Tongzhi died childless (rumoredly from syphilis contracted from his secret visits to brothels outside the palace), she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">disregarded the imperial house law</a> by appointing her three-year-old nephew (son of her sister, who married Xianfeng's half brother) to succeed as Guangxu Emperor. So that she could cling to power longer when the throne should have passed to someone from the next generation down from Tongzhi, with Tongzhi's empress as regent (whom she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">hated</a>, and eventually got rid of, the final straw being when the empress inadvertently reminded her of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">her concubine status</a>). When Guangxu came of age, Cixi handed power to him, only to stage a coup 100 days later and put him under house arrest, because he introduced westernization reforms and dismissed her favorite advisers. When she was on her deathbed, she allegedly ordered the childless emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">poisoned</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">he predeceased her by one day</a>) so that she could name his successor, the three-year-old Puyi, who was his nephew and her grandnephew.
<ul><li> Lu Zhi, wife of Liu Bang of Han, is another Chinese example. She presided as the power behind the throne for three emperors up until her death.
</li><li> Tang Dynasty Empress Wu Zetian was probably a semi-example. She ruled as regent for two of her sons, and seized power at the age of 66 to become the only woman to rule as Huangdi in her own right.
</li><li> Huo Guang of Western Han is a rare benign example, being the most powerful person in China between 87 B.C. to 68 B.C. He served as regent for three emperors, deposed the second of the three, and the third asked others to present matters to Huo <em>before</em> him—yet he had no intention to usurp the throne and his deposition of an emperor is commonly seen a way to deal with an heir that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">an absolute nightmare</a>.
</li><li> A particularly peculiar one occurred during the Warring States period, in the State of Qin. King Zhaoxiang of Qin's mother had been regent for him and used her position to grant vast fiefs to her brothers; as a result, Zhaoxiang remained under his mother's thumb after he officially became ruling king. However, a hardheaded fellow by the name of Fan Sui—who had previously been an official in the rival state of Wei before being run out of town most unceremoniously<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00qxc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note00qxc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00qxc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He had been beaten nearly to death by his drunken rivals at court and then dumped in a latrine</span>—convinced Zhaoxiang to run his mother and uncles out of town, conquer Wei, and start Qin on a giant war of conquest. Zhaoxiang's great-grandson was a fellow named Zhao Zheng...better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShiHuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShiHuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi</a>.
</li><li> Sima Yan (founder of the Jin dynasty and reuniter of the Three Kingdoms period) declared his eldest son, Sima Zhong his heir. Unfortunately, everyone except Sima Yan saw that Sima Zhong was highly developmentally disabled and required a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent for Life</a>. The Jin dynasty would be crippled by the War of Eight Princes (over who would be "regent"), and when Sima Zhong was poisoned at the age of 48, he still had the mind of a 5-year-old.
</li><li> There're actually too many examples in the Chinese history to quote here—while most dynastic changes in China between the third to the tenth centuries were the direct consequence of a military coup, the leader of the coup would not immediately usurp the throne. They would, however, sit as a Regent for Life for a period of time before "persuading" the emperor to abdicate in their favour.
</li></ul></li><li> Catherine de Medici of France acted as Regent while her two underage sons were King and heavily interfered in the reign of her third son, Henry III. It is doubtful they would have retained power without her. She is widely detested for her supposed role in the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, where thousands of French Protestants were killed. Modern historians suspect that Catherine didn't actually have anything to do with the massacre, but became an easy scapegoat because she was Italian, and worse, a Medici, so she had to be an evil plotter who poisoned her enemies. As a matter of fact she did the best she could to reconcile the opposing Huguenot and Catholic factions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> believed that she had only by the grace of God avoided a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent for Life</a>. When she was seventeen and recovering from typhoid fever, her mother's "friend" Sir John Conroy tried to make her sign a document stating that her mother, and through her Conroy, would rule in her place <em>even after she turned eighteen</em>. Victoria had the presence of mind to refuse to sign the document, and it's unlikely that Parliament would have consented to such an agreement, but it was only her accession as Queen at eighteen that stopped Conroy from repeatedly pressing her to make him her regent. (It may also have helped that her uncle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">King William IV</a>, saw right through his sister-in-law's schemes and gave made it known he supported his niece's efforts to remain independent.)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note162hp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note162hp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note162hp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some even say that he clung to life despite his illness as long as he did so that Victoria could inherit at 18, at which point she would have to be recognized as monarch without a regency, basically for this reason. While we can't say for sure that's even possible, we can say that William would have done it if it were.</span> In fact, her entire life before her ascension as Queen was designed to make her this. She was raised under the Kensington System, which was a strict and elaborate set of rules designed by her mother and Conroy to make her weak and dependent, which thankfully did not work.
</li><li> Birger Jarl of Sweden (1210-1266), first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> of his brother-in-law King Eric "the Lisp and Lame" and managed to get his underaged son Valdemar to be declared King after his death and made himself his regent. Then he beat down a rebellion from several nobles who considered that cheating.
<ul><li> Fun fact: Valdemar was in his late 20's when his father died. One can just imagine the tension in the Royal Court between the now adult King and his father who had been the de facto ruler for decades.

</li><li> Johann Friedrich Struensee was royal physician to the schizophrenic King Christian VII of Denmark and a minister in the Danish government. He rose in power to a position of <em>de facto</em> regent of the country, where he tried to carry out widespread reforms. His affair with Queen Caroline Matilda caused scandal, especially after the birth of a daughter, Princess Louise Augusta, and was the catalyst for the intrigues and power play that caused his downfall and a dramatic death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco">Francisco Franco</a> was officially Regent of the Kingdom, among other jobs. Despite popular belief, he was not a Fascist but an Ultra-Conservative and a Monarchist (the Fascist party came to despise him for this, despite him having a lot in common with them on issues other than monarchism), and was ostensibly holding power until the rightful King stepped in... though he didn't actually say who that was until 6 years before his death. The man in question was the son of the Legitimist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHero">Juan Carlos</a> (conveniently, a descendant of <em>both</em> of the competing branches of the royal family), who upon Franco's death promptly declared a liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy.
</li><li> Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony of Madagascar is generally thought to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">the man behind the woman</a> for Queens Rasoherina, Ranavalona II, and Ranavalona III. Incidentally, all three of them married him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfStuart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfStuart">The House of Stuart</a> traces their lineage from an ancestor who named himself "Stewart" because he was hereditary High Steward of Scotland (a position in the court that occasionally entailed running affairs of state the King couldn't handle personally). The Stewarts (as they were known at the time) intermarried with some junior royals, and when the Bruce dynasty (the descendants of Robert the Bruce) petered out, the throne came to their Stewart cousins. (The "Stuart" spelling is a later development, to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryQueenOfScots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryQueenOfScots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>' French in-laws pronounce the name right.)
</li><li> Prince Luitpold became regent of Bavaria on June 10, 1886, after his nephew King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria">Ludwig II of Bavaria</a> was declared unfit to rule. Ludwig died under mysterious circumstances three days later, leaving the Bavarian throne to his younger brother Otto who was already confined to a mental asylum. Luitpold thus continued to be Prince Regent (Prinzregent) of Bavaria until his own death in 1912. His son prince Ludwig succeeded him in that position, but was too impatient to wait for mad Otto to die (which he finally did in 1916, as it turned out), and so had himself proclaimed King Ludwig III in 1913. This alienated even part of Bavaria's monarchists, but in the end Ludwig III was forced to abdicate during the November Revolution of 1918.
</li><li> The only regency in the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a> was when Anna Ioannovna the Bloody's heir Ivan VI was still a one year old. The child's mother, Princess Anna Leopoldovna, was appointed regent. However this didn't last long; the baby tsar was deposed by a palace revolution led by Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a> who reasonably thought she has a better claim on the throne. After being deposed, Ivan grew up in prison and lived there until the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>, when some not very bright Guards officer had an idea to put Ivan back on the throne and become a chancellor; both were executed.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a> herself can be considered that. She wasn't a member of the Romanov House, deposed her husband when their son was eight (there are some doubts about his legitimacy, but he was officially the heir), and continued to rule until said son was over 40.
</li></ul></li><li> Tran Thu Do started out as the Head of the Royal Guard at the Vietnamese royal court of the late 1100s. When the mentally ill Emperor Ly Hue Tong abdicated and was succeeded by his very young daughter, Ly Chieu Hoang, Tran became her regent but soon gained control of the nation by marrying her off to his nephew, who became the new emperor, marrying Hue Tong's widow and killing off the remaining members of the Ly family. Until his death, Tran remained the true power behind the throne.
</li><li> The Byzantine Empress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Eirene</a> started out as regent for her son... then, when he got too old to be kept under control, had him blinded and killed and took power in her own right, disarming the army so it wouldn't replace her (which, incidentally, let the Abbasid Caliph conquer large parts of the empire) and trying (largely unsuccessfully) to negotiate alliances with western powers as a military substitute. She was the first ruling Empress of the Romans, depending on whether or not you believe Ulpia Severina ruled as Empress regnant after her husband, Aurelian, was assassinated.
</li><li> North Korea is a necrocracy, based on the rules of its late ruler, Kim Il-sung. After his death, he was elevated to the highest position as "eternal leader" while his successors are technically second in command as the "Supreme Leader".
