<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise was fond of this trope; the hero Goku is often given a mundane but laborious task to retrieve an item that would increase his power, only to find that it was the task itself that made him stronger. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">wised up to this sort of thing</a> — or so he thinks, because nobody really trains him the same way twice.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Master Roshi goes to comedic excess when he forces Goku and Krillin to work long hours delivering milk on foot, sowing fields with their bare hands, and doing chores at construction sites, all while wearing weighted turtle shells. It really does build them up fast, but Roshi is more excited by the few bucks he makes off it.
</li><li> Goku's training with Korin involving climbing up his tower to meet him, and then snatch the bottle of his Sacred Water, said to increase one's strength. It doubled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> when Goku had an opportunity to steal it from an apparently-sleeping Korin; Goku decided against it, much to Korin's surprise. Its effectiveness was shown part-way when Korin tossed Goku's Four Star Ball off the tower; it took Goku only an hour or two to go back down and up the tower again, when his first climb up took an entire day. When Goku finally got the water, he found that it was only ordinary tap water.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Tao Pai Pai</a> makes his way up the tower to claim its power, Korin quickly realizes he's a bad guy and just gives him the water; he also gives Tao a black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingOnACloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingOnACloud">flying cloud</a> to ride back down so he won't get any stronger from the climb.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note017jq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note017jq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note017jq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And on top of that, Korin makes the cloud disappear near the bottom, insulting Tao as well.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> After training with Kami, Goku frequently trained solely by using weighted clothing, and after King Kai by using special gravity rooms, something Vegeta would later pick up. Discarding the weighted clothing would often be used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">when fights got serious</a>.
</li><li> King Kai admitted this was going on from the start. The gravity on his planet is ten times that of Earth (the same as that of planet Vegeta, home of his next opponents), so when Goku arrived there he could barely move. King Kai told him that when he could catch Bubbles the monkey (and in the anime, hit Gregory the cricket on the head with a mallet), he was ready to learn King Kai's special techniques.
</li><li> Gohan's training with the Z Sword. The extremely heavy blade is supposed to be the only weapon capable of defeating Majin Buu, but shatters when actually put to the test. Gohan then notes that swinging the sword around has made him much stronger and faster, which may have been the point all along. Subverted immediately when Goku says that the power increase is negligible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Double subverted when breaking the sword releases the Elder Kai, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeToUnlockMoreTruePotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeToUnlockMoreTruePotential">abilities</a> turn out to be the <em>real</em> prize.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>
<ul><li> By <em>Super</em>, Goku is very used to this trope and assumes that he and Vegeta having to change the God of Destruction Beerus' bedsheets while he's sleeping — a surprisingly dangerous task — is another example of the trope. Vegeta says no, this is just ordinary housework that has nothing to do with their training.
</li><li> Before he shows up to train with Whis, Goku challenges Piccolo to a one-on-one contest- harvesting all his crops as quickly as possible. While initially irritated for being called to do field work and skeptical that it could ever be considered training, the Namekian very quickly realizes its effectiveness in keeping his arms and legs moving, while keeping his mind focused.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Ranma's training in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> <em>started</em> here and escalated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">lunatic levels of difficulty and danger</a>.
<ul><li> Ranma's rival Ryoga also undergoes this type of training, getting boulders thrown at him to learn the rock-crushing Bakusai Tenketsu technique. As it turns out, Bakusai Tenketsu <em>only</em> works against rigid objects like rocks, but getting hit repeatedly by swinging boulders eventually makes the fighter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>. And it was all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> from Cologne to freak Ranma out enough so that <em>he</em> would train on his own and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">become a better suitor for her granddaughter</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a>, Happosai trains Kuno by having him get the ingredients for his "speed of light elixir" from some strange places (like the girl's locker room), which would require him to get faster and tougher. It works, but the formula was so bad (being made from the dirt under Happosai's nails) that it <em>undoes</em> the training.
</li><li> Kuno also tried training by going to Watermelon Island, standing under a waterfall, and dicing watermelons as they came down from upstream. He got really good at it, chopping watermelons to tiny cubes entirely by reflex, and getting stronger and tougher than Ranma himself! But it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">subverted</a> because the entire point of the training was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">impress girls</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashingWatermelons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashingWatermelons">Smashing Watermelons</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>. Parodied in a filler episode. When Inuyasha wanted to get stronger and power up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, he went to the sword's creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">Toutousai</a>, for training. Toutousai is both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonka">The Wonka</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor">Eccentric Mentor</a> at the <em>best</em> of times. As a result, when his response to Inuyasha's request is an off-hand comment about wanting a bath, Inuyasha — with atypical gusto — starts cutting firewood, hauls water, and works the bellows to heat the fire, believing that Toutousai has put this trope into effect and that it's all part of training. And then he discovers that Toutousai was being serious: he really did want a bath. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">wrecking ball mode</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Brock and Ash meet Bruno, a member of the Elite 4 who agrees to train them. He gets them to do a ton of chores. Brock assumes this all has a deeper meaning, but Bruno just wanted his chores done. His actual training could be summed up as "Be nice to Pokemon". Or perhaps "You can't get something for nothing."
</li><li> Many seasons later, Kalos gym leader Korrina has difficulty getting her Lucario to listen to her during Mega Evolution, so she journeys to meet Mabel, a family acquaintance with a loyal Mega Mawile. After an initial battle to test her, the training turns out to be over a week's worth of flower arranging. It pays off in the end, as the training needed wasn't physical but rather the need to understand the teammate's differing perspective when battling.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, the Daycare Lady locks Gold into a cage full of dangerous looking Pokemon. Gold's Cyndaquil ends up evolving thanks to fighting them, and Gold immediately shouts his thanks. Turns out the old lady was just too lazy to look after the Pokemon herself and was using Gold to give them some exercise.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>, Moka nabbed a magic-cancelling whip so Inner Moka could come out and play, and they both took Tsukune out on a shopping trip around Preternatural Street, which led to attacks from the rest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Harem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Harem">Harem</a>. Tsukune figures out how to remotely sense demonic energy as a matter of survival, which everyone concludes was her motive.

Ironically, <em>this</em> lesson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">gets specific use more often than the strength training does</a>.

She herself learned this from her own teacher, who according to one gaiden volume <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">did it because he thought she wanted hand-to-hand combat training.

Ikki thought it was this trope, but the good doctor later admits that this served no practical purpose.
<ul><li> An earlier case involves Ikki and Metabee, after a sound defeat against an aquatic medabot, asking an old fisherman to teach them how to robattle in the water. After much begging, the "training" indeed consists of all sorts of chores for the old man, including a back massage, but eventually Metabee does learn how to retain balance while in the water, just not <em>how to move</em> in it—that was tomorrow's lesson. In the end, despite Ikki and Metabee's victory in the rematch, it's left unclear if the old man was sincere in his training, mooching off his students all along and they were lucky, or making it up as he went.

A young kid who had only worked as a dishwasher on a Marine ship kitchen accidentally destroys the weekly (and almost legendary) curry lunch for the officers, and the head chef forces him to make a new batch on his own as punishment. With Sanji <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">providing some subtle clues of his own</a>, the kid learns that the observations made as a simple dishwasher have given him the fundamental skills to cook the meal.

</li><li> The eponymous protagonist of <em>Noritaka</em> gets trained almost exclusively like this, being made to do a job or chore that will build up both his strength and the muscle memory he needs for his next fight. After finding out that feeding a very angry cat living under the kickboxing gym and escaping her wrath taught him a surprisingly effective elbow attack, Noritaka wises up and stops protesting for the ridiculous tasks he has to perform, but onlookers <em>still</em> get surprised at his "training".
<ul><li> Noritaka has been forced to carry heavy weights since he was a kid, first by his many older siblings foistering their bags on him while going to grade school and then by his classmates in junior high doing the same with the class loser, with his father having him to work in the family's construction company the whole time and continuing even in high school. This resulted in Noritaka building up formidable back muscles, that translate in him having a terrifying hitting power in spite of his small build and thin arms and legs.

By the time of the main series it's implied Minako is training in a more traditional way off-page...

Kakeru thus uses manga to help hone Prince's running, by holding the manga up for him to read while he runs and making him hold the books in his hands while running (mimicking running to his room to read them) to fix his arm positioning. Although more needs to be done to whip him into shape for Hakone itself, this does help Prince to eventually cut back his official track meet time from 45 minutes to 30 minutes.

He later signs her up for a mage exam under the guise of having her chaperone his son, and she proceeds to ace both the written and practial portions (though the latter was mostly Tohru's doing).

When Mr. Miyagi agrees to train Daniel, Daniel thinks he's going to get practical karate training from the get-go. Instead, Miyagi tells him to do various chores — not just waxing cars, but also painting the house, painting the fence, and sanding the deck. Miyagi also showed Daniel the precise way he wanted everything done. Daniel nearly quits, thinking Miyagi is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoochingMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoochingMaster">Mooching Master</a>, before Miyagi demonstrates that these chores were to build up the strength and muscle memory necessary for performing karate blocks (and was also a way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">test how much patience he had</a>). <em>Then</em> Miyagi showed Daniel how to punch and kick.

Dre initially interprets this as punishment for his attitude towards his mother, until the Wax On Wax Off kicks in later. Dre calls out Mr. Han on not knowing Kung Fu, and Mr. Han starts an impromptu spar to show Dre he was building up muscle memory. As you can see when Mr. Han starts punching at Dre, he is performing blocks and other evasive maneuvers with every step. For several cycles, Mr. Han says "jacket on, jacket off". It's also actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explained in this movie why the teacher uses this indirect teaching method</a>: to get Dre to understand that Kung Fu isn't just a way of fighting, it's a way of life:

He later uses this exact technique to train <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Robby, AKA Johnny's son</span>, with pretty much the same reaction. Daniel's wife even suggests that he's enjoying being on the other side of it a little too much. This is contrasted with Johnny having Miguel do various chores around the dojo. There is no hidden meaning behind it and is simply a way for Miguel to work off his dojo fees.
<ul><li> However, when it comes to actual training, Johnny never indulges in this trope at all. While his training methods are harsh and sometimes brutal, he is never less than completely up-front about what his program entails and is supposed to accomplish.

Aldur kept setting his young apprentice to various menial, pointless, and increasingly strenuous tasks, culminating in him ordering the young Belgarath to move a boulder out of his way, since he couldn't be bothered to step around it. Inspired by this, Belgarath did the same thing to Garion, who tried <em>lifting</em> the boulder. Newtonian physics still worked, apparently, and Garion found himself in a rather deep hole.

Subverted in that she understands the purpose of it all and appreciates it.

Samwell Tarly realizes what is actually happening: as the Lord Commander's steward, he will be shadowing him for most of the day and be privy to all the processes of running the Watch. Since Mormont has picked Snow himself, it means that he is actually grooming Snow to become his successor as Lord Commander.
</li></ul></li><li> In E.W. Hildick's <em>The McGurk Mysteries</em> series, Jack McGurk (leader of a band of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective">kid detectives</a>) frequently came up with "training exercises" that also got the other kids to do his work for him. For example, raking the yard to match leaves. The point, as McGurk explained, was to look for leaves that didn't match the trees in the yard. Really, he was just getting the others to rake the yard so he didn't have to.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">By the Sword</a></em>, Kero's training with Tarma begins with a whole lot of chopping wood. She doesn't seem to resent it, but she does eventually get curious when Tarma starts having her chop wood that's been set up in oddly specific configurations, at which point Tarma finally gets around to explaining the specific purpose of the exercise: to develop the specific muscle groups that she'll be using to swing a sword.
</li><li> In <em>A Matter of Thorns</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms">Realms of Infamy</a>) by James M. Ward, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant">Knight Errant</a> explains his approach:

</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Ganithar</strong>: No, no, lad. That's not what I want. Try to <em>anticipate</em> what I need. Anticipation is vital in a warrior, too.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em> series, ambient mages have to study and learn <em>everything</em> about their affinity, including the tedious chores.
<ul><li> One example mentioned a few times is Daja (metal/heat mage) having to do the most tedious thing as a blacksmith; making nails. This is doubly so, as while the swords or sculptures or larger pieces she wants to do or learn will get her recognition (or are just more fun), the nails are the most useful thing she can make.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the 1953 novel <em>A Light in the Forest</em>: True Son, an Anglo man raised by a native tribe, tells one of his young white relatives that in order to be strong, he has to chase butterflies and rub some of the powder from their wings on his chest, which he says is magical. One of the white men comments that the story is a good way to convince children to exercise, but True Son is surprised by the comment: he genuinely believes in the magical properties of the butterfly dust.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInheritanceCycle">The Inheritance Cycle</a></em>, this is supposedly the way that Dragon Riders were taught to be aware of their magic. They were given incredibly arduous tasks to do (such as filling barrels using buckets — using only their feet) so that they would eventually get so frustrated that they'd spontaneously do <em>something</em> magical.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes">Holes</a></em>, this is the idea behind Madame Zeroni's deal. Elya is to carry a pig up to a spring at the top of a mountain each day, in order to impress a woman, with its eventual weight as a dowry. However, the true purpose is to have Elya carrying a gradually growing pig; over time, it would develop the muscles that would truly impress the girl. Subverted when the woman turns out to be stupid, and Elya leaves without her.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall Universe</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNumairChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNumairChronicles">The Numair Chronicles</a></em> Yadeen teaches the young mage Arram focus and control through juggling.

<ul><li> Arguably the crowner is probably when, after assigning the class to read several different, random books from the library, he doesn't bother showing up, just writes on the board, "Discuss."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1bb0t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1bb0t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1bb0t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Which teaches them, amongst other things, initiative</span> Later, Kvothe notes that at least he had a much better understanding of how to use the library, thanks to Elodin's random assignment. It takes him a whole book to figure out that <em>this was the whole point of the exercise.</em>

</li><li> Seen in flashback, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a> novel, <em>Question Quest</em>: When The Gorgon approaches Good Magician Humphrey with her question, he makes her perform the customary year's service (in this case, a year as his maid) before even letting her ask, let alone answering. Humphrey knew that if he answered her question normally, it would be a disaster: The Gorgon approached him not only out of her desperate loneliness, but infatuation with the man who managed to overcome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">her talent</a> (The main source of said loneliness). The year's service let her get to know the real Humphrey, warts and all. It also gave her an out in case she decided the real him wasn't something she could deal with. So when he allows her to ask her question at the end of the year, he's knows she's asking <em>him</em>, and not some heroic ideal version of Good Magician Humphrey she may have had. Her question was "Will you marry me?" His answer was "yes."
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendOfTheCondorHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendOfTheCondorHeroes">Legend Of The Condor Heroes</a></em>: Guo Jing's slow acquisition of martial skills is the despair of his shifus until he meets a traveling Taoist priest, Ma Yu, who doesn't agree to become his master, but offers to teach him some "breathing exercises" to help him focus and sleep better. Guo Jing takes up the exercises, and suddenly he's picking up kung-fu techniques in days that would previously have taken him the better part of a year to acquire. Turns out that what Ma Yu has been teaching him were the basic <em>neigong</em> techniques of his Taoist sect, without their names.
</li><li> Used word for word in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicians">The Magicians</a></em>: during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">fourth year</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Brakebills</a> students are divided into separate cells and told to magically hammer a nail into a block of wood under every possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPrerequisite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPrerequisite">Circumstance</a>. Quentin quickly realizes that they're doing this in order to fully internalize the mechanics behind spellcasting so they can act on it without thinking, and even drops the line "wax on, wax off." After finally completing this exercise, their next task is to perform a spell to <em>extract</em> the nails from the block of wood.

Sometimes they're upfront about why they're asking for a mundane task, sometimes they're not. For example, Ran and Retsu learn to play the piano in order to get better at charging the Geki Bazooka, Jan helps with cooking to learn patience, and Ran fly-fishes to use the Geki Hammer.

A novice is ordered to plant cabbage <em>with its leaves in the soil and roots in the air</em>. Later a monk explains: "The cabbage isn't dear to us, it's your obedience."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, one of the flashbacks to the island where Oliver was stranded shows a similar training. In order to strengthen him enough to draw back the string of a bow, he is forced to keep slapping water in a bowl. Later, in the present day, he uses the same training technique on Roy Harper. However, at this point Roy has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, so the training is more about learning precise control than gaining muscle.

For example, in the second game, a teacher considers Ryo far too hotheaded and revenge-obsessed to teach, and tells him that he can't meet the master he's looking for until he clears his mind...by taking the books out of the library so that they can be aired out (this builds strength, patience and balance, as he is expected to carry tall stacks of narrow books). Once he actually argues that this is a ridiculous requirement (which takes several days), he is <em>then</em> told by the teacher (who is, of course, the master he's looking for) that he remains too impulsive, and he needs the grace and clarity of mind to catch a falling leaf. For several days.
<ul><li> Inverted with the Tai Chi man in the second game. Ryo watches the man go through the slow, careful motions of Tai Chi, then punch a thick tree hard enough to shake it. He realizes that Tai Chi is, in fact, a martial art, and asks the man to teach him to punch that hard. The old man tries to teach Ryo the fluid motions of Tai Chi (which, when sped up, are in fact deadly motions), and Ryo instead spends some time punching the tree really hard.

Pickaxes, for some reason, draw upon the "Mining" skill for both.
<ul><li> For the Adventurer, knapping develops agility, strength, kinesthetic and spatial Sense, and also produces sharp rocks to throw, developing additional attributes as well as marksmanship. Walking with a crutch trains endurance and willpower, and if your adventurer ever breaks or loses a leg, he or she will be able to grab a crutch and walk at their usual speed.

The Uncle gives him three chores to perform: dusting his bookshelves, ringing the bell to call farmhands, and scouring clean all the floors in the house. Each task had to be done perfectly; the bookshelves completely dust-free, the large iron bell rung loudly (and frequently), and the floors spotless. In his eighteenth year, the boy discovers that his uncle means to abandon the now-failing farm, and the boy with it, without teaching him anything. The boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">silently</a> picks up a heavy axe, to discover it doesn't weigh any more than the dusting rod he'd used for years. The dusting and bell-ringing gave him the strength and muscle memory to chop his uncle to bits, and cleaning up the mess afterward was so easy that no one could tell there had been a murder. Deciding he had indeed learned a trade after all, the young man eventually goes off to join the Assassin's Guild. Incidentally, the book that contains this story, titled "The Axe Man," is a skill book. What skill does it raise? Axes.

<ul><li> Although this is less common today than in the past, certain traditional martial arts dojos have a program of <em>uchideshi</em>, or live-in students. Besides training two or more times a day, possibly while holding down another job or completing university classes, they are also responsible, under the direction of the senior students, for the care and upkeep of the dojo, for cooking their own meals as well as catering for guests, and keeping their rooms in tip-top order. The care and discipline they put into these tasks is considered to be just as much a part of the training as the martial art practice.
</li><li> This is similarly true for training in the US military. Trainees are required to maintain the barracks area in addition to their regular training. This not only includes keeping their own rooms clean (which may include storing their clothes in a certain specific way), but also assigning specific people to carry out certain chores for a period of time (say, vacuuming the hallway for a week, or cleaning the latrine before lights-out). All this besides the weekly "GI<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bltm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4bltm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bltm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> General Inspection</span> Party", where everybody cleans the entire barracks top to bottom, sometimes for hours at a time. The point is to promote attention to detail and self-motivation. If recruits can't follow simple instructions or take initiative in training, they would be useless in combat. It's also useful in weapons maintenance, which requires close familiarity with a weapon's component parts.
<ul><li> The US Air Force Academy carries this a step further, requiring cadets to fill out forms evaluating each meal. By filling out the same form every day, cadets learn to complete checklists quickly and efficiently.
</li></ul></li><li> Apprentices of certain craftsmen would be put to various menial tasks in order for them to build the muscles or motor skills required for the craft. For instance, new chefs at a traditional restaurant typically spend a few solid months at the dish pit before actually touching a single knife. It teaches the importance (and inevitability) of cleaning dishes and cookware, as well as impressing the sense of urgency needed in being a cook.
</li><li> Legendary basketball coach John Wooden would always begin the season's practice with a lecture on how properly to put on a pair of socks so as to avoid having them cause blisters during games. The attention to detail inherent in the lesson translated to fundamental soundness in all other elements of the game and ten championships in twelve years. It's one of the many reasons why there are few who disagree when Wooden is called the greatest ever to coach the game.
<ul><li> A related concept is that of 'Marginal Gains' (popularised as a term by Team Sky in Cycling). Spending time calculating and adopting a perfect pedalling motion, or doing yoga to improve flexibility, or adjusting the brake position to improve aerodynamics will not, on their own, produce drastically different results. But doing all of these, and more, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">tandem</a> with one another, and you will really notice the improvements.
</li></ul></li><li> A shift toward emphasizing stability muscles has had several strength training regimens like Crossfit and sports-specific workouts add strongman-style exercises like flipping a tire or wringing out a wet towel: the muscles that these exercises build are not directly involved in most competitive feats of strength, but <em>support</em> those feats.
</li><li> A major part of any veterinary nursing student's training is kennel duty — walking dogs, scooping litter boxes, washing dishes, and cleaning cages — long before they're allowed anywhere near a microscope, syringe, or needle. <em>Many</em> prospective vet nurses wash out within the first several months because they can't handle the fact that 90% of veterinary practice involves cleaning things up, mostly bodily fluids and related products.
</li><li> Anything in the entertainment industry will involve starting off at the "bottom rung": most crew members for film and TV start as production assistants moving furniture and passing out clipboards, while most actors start in professional productions as extras who may do little more than sit at a table in the background (probably unpaid) while still working the same long day as everyone else. Aspiring musicians may start as roadies and guitar techs, hauling gear and making sure everything's in tune while the band gets the credit. Someone who desires to work in the lighting department in a theatre will often be apprenticed (officially or otherwise) to an experienced tech who sends the new guy off to hang heavy Fresnels and plug stuff in. Being in these positions allows for excellent observation of everything that goes into making movies and music and everything else, and helps teach them the discipline and patience to work long hours in demanding jobs. If someone can't handle a 14 hour day of hauling stuff around or passing out release forms to extras, they probably can't handle the more glamorous job they want.
</li><li> In music in particular, just learning the instrument can involve this type of thing. For example, wind instrument players often spend time doing breathing exercises or practicing embouchure while not touching their instrument. Singers make a lot of strange noises while warming up. And so forth.
</li><li> When working at a library, the entry-level job of library page can be this. The bulk of a page's work is shelving the books, which most consider to be boring, menial grunt work. But part of the benefit of starting off there is gaining familiarity with both the Dewey Decimal System and where all these sections are locally. If your memory is particularly sharp, this can help in situations where the card catalog is inaccessible, such as when the software is being upgraded.
</li><li> The phrase "Farm strength", where people from a farm who have never lifted weights are just as strong, if not stronger than people who regularly go to a weight room and work out. Turns out that loading 100 pound bales of hay for hours every single day for 9 months of the year makes for excellent strength training.
</li><li> In <em>The Last Lecture</em>, Randy Pausch referred to this trope as a "head fake", saying "The best way to teach somebody something is to have them think they're learning something else."
</li><li> Tai Chi is known these days as a slow, fluid exercise program, with careful movements, an emphasis on graceful actions and a meditative practice. But it <em>is</em> a martial art: if you speed up the movements, Tai Chi practicioners are dangerous combatants.
</li><li> There's a German saying that goes "Lehrjahre sind keine Herrenjahre" about the rather unique (well, unique in this day, it used to be common in the medieval era) German system of <em>Ausbildung</em> or on the job training. The saying can be loosely translated as "learner's years are no fun" and while there is a bit of hazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">For the Lulz</a> going on, part of it is this trope.
</li><li> In certain times and places, martial arts were banned, and practitioners who wished to maintain training hid it in other practices, such as chores (as in early Karate, as referenced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheKarateKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheKarateKid">The Karate Kid</a></em> franchise) or dances (as most famously done by Capoeira).
