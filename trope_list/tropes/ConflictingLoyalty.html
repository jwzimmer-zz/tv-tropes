<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> can get into this sometimes with the handlers trying to balance making the girls effective weapons while still letting them retain some semblance of happiness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi Uchiha</span> was forced to choose between his loyalty to his family<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and clan</span>, or to his village. He chose his village without too much thought and wiped out his rebellious family. But his <em>true</em> conflicting loyalty is between choosing the village or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his brother Sasuke,</span> whom he loves more than the village but is also willing to strip of free will so he can protect the village for the rest of his life.
</li><li> A major part of the second-season arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a></em> centers around Ran Shuuei being caught in a conflict of loyalty — between his loyalty to his Emperor (who has shown him absolute trust) and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big Screwed Up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Clan</a>, the Rans, who dislike the emperor and only care about their own people and lands. Getting it resolved takes a lot of work (and, ultimately, intentionally getting himself disowned so that he can freely swear his unconditional loyalty to Ryuuki).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LeChevalierDEon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LeChevalierDEon">Le Chevalier d'Eon</a></em> has this as a <em>major</em> theme. Events really start unravelling around the topic of loyalty to an individual versus loyalty to a cause, or when loyalty to "king and country" ends up as two conflicting loyalties. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first event to really drive this home is when Durand - an unconditionally loyal secret agent - is ordered by his king to kill his friends to protect a state secret. This screws him up enough to nearly get him killed. In the end, he insists on protecting his friends while still trying to have it both ways. A villain later tries to persuade Durand to join him by calling him out on it, asking why Durand would serve a king who would give him such an order. Even then, Durand doesn't give in.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Suzaku Kururugi is Japanese by birth, and only wants to protect his country - and is working in the military of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> that invaded it. And then there are his loyalties to the people he cares about, many of whom are at various points on opposite sides of the conflict. And then there's his personal ideology...
<ul><li> Not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Lelouch</a>, who himself has this conflict starting when he finds out he's the pilot of the Lancelot.
</li></ul></li><li> Vice Admiral Garp of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has a pretty severe case of this throughout the Whitebeard arc. He's torn between his loyalty to the World Government and Navy as a Vice Admiral and as a friend/comrade of Fleet Admiral Sengoku, his feelings towards his grandsons Ace and Luffy who are both notorious pirates along with Ace facing execution, and his own promise to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gold Roger to take care of his son Ace</span>. It's so bad that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin">all but throws the fight</a> against Luffy when he tries to stop him from saving Ace</span>. Ultimately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he fails to uphold any of these promises due to this conflict. Sengoku realized he threw the fight, Ace is killed by Akainu anyway, and Luffy suffers total mental collapse</span>. Curly Dadan angrily calls him out on this, enraged he would dare show his face in the village again.
</li><li> Athrun has this big time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny</a></em>. On the one hand, Durandal sweet-talked him into rejoining ZAFT to protect his former nation PLANTs from EA attack. He also has loyalty to the crew of the Minerva as fellow soldiers who have tried to save a world that hates them. On the other hand, his adopted nation Orb was effectively blackmailed into joining the EA, and his best friend and his ex-fiancees were forced to flee with the Archangel. This all comes to a head when Orb is ordered to send a fleet out to fight ZAFT, and Athrun's ship the Minerva is sent out to fight it, and the Archangel ends up intervening against both ZAFT and the EA to protect the Orb fleet. Cue ten episodes of Athrun wrestling with his loyalties until he finally jumps ship (again) and joins Orb.
<ul><li> He never even really gets to totally make the choice. After learning of this Durandal decides he doesn't need someone that isn't completely loyal to him and sends soldiers after Athrun branding him a traitor to Zaft before he really did anything and forcing him to flee back to Orb.

Akizuki is on the isolationist side (expel foreigners and keep the Shogunate system) and Kusaka is on the imperialist side (open the borders and embrace modern culture). Somewhat subverted in that both main characters want to keep the borders open, but nonetheless they end up going along with their clans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em> gives an interesting variant with Demolishor, whose loyalties are both to Megatron. In this case, the conflict comes down to whether he obeys the last command Megatron gave at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Armada</a></em>, or whether he disregards that to go along with the dramatically different orders Megatron starts giving after being resurrected.

She is also this towards her mediums, whom she addresses as "Master" and is determined to help them be happy even if it keeps her trapped with no free will.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AdventuresOfTheLittleKoala" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AdventuresOfTheLittleKoala">Adventures of the Little Koala</a></em>, Roobear ends up stuck in an example of this near the beginning of "Who Will Be the Flower Queen?". With Weather predicting an outstanding eucalyptus blossom display for the year's eucalyptus blossom festival, the village decides to hold an election for the queen of the festival.

</li><li> Conflicts of loyalty play a huge part in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a></em>. To point out the more important ones: In the matter of the murder of Siegfried, Gunther is torn between his obligation to protect the honour of his wife Brunhilde and those towards his vassal and brother-in-law Siegfried. Later, after the deed is done, Gunther and his brothers are torn between their feudal obligation to protect their vassal Hagen and their fraternal loyalty towards their sister Kriemhild; they opt for Hagen. Rüdiger of Bechlarn is visibly torn between the oaths he swore to his queen Kriemhild and to the Burgundians, one of whom is betrothed to Rüdiger's daughter. Kriemhild has to choose between her sisterly affections to her brothers (especially Giselher, the youngest) and to her loyalty to her dead husband Siegfried. She eventually opts for the latter, allowing Gernot and Giselher to die in battle and ordering Gunther to be executed. This is an interesting switch from earlier versions of the story (preserved e. g. in the Icelandic Atli-saga), she killed her second husband Atli (Etzel) in order to avenge her dead brothers.

<ul><li> A recurring theme for Jaime Lannister all through the series:
<ul><li> He provides the trope quote when he points out to Lady Catelyn Stark that the oaths about honoring your family and honoring your King are forced to be helplessly contradictory sooner or later. If you've sworn to defend both the king and the innocent, what do you do when the king massacres the innocent?
</li><li> As he revealed to Brienne, Jaime broke his oath and killed the Mad King when he decided to explode huge quantities of wildfire hidden beneath King's Landing. This action saved 500,000 lives but came at the price of his honor and universal contempt for soiling his office.
</li><li> He faces this dilemma again in Season 4 on his return to King's Landing when he must choose between his brother and the rest of his family when Joffrey dies and Tyrion is arrested and Sansa is suspected and between protecting Sansa - an oath he swore to Catelyn Stark which is complicated by her death and a changed political landscape - and pleasing Cersei. Jaime had also made the decision to honour his Kingsguard vows as best as possible but this is no easy task. He eventually decides to go against his family in secret, giving Brienne help to rescue Sansa, and working with Varys to rescue Tyrion.
</li></ul></li><li> Ned Stark consistently chooses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> no matter the cost until he must choose between his honour and his other core value: his family.
</li><li> Jon Snow is constantly caught between his duty to Night's Watch and family, justice, and love. First he wants to go to war beside his family but he doesn't want to leave the Watch after swearing to serve, then the needs of the Watch require he overlook the crimes of Craster, then he falls in love with a wildling. He is also conflicted between the Watch's purpose and protecting the soft and unreliable Sam. Jon's very conflicted.
</li><li> Theon Greyjoy gets caught between the Starks who held him hostage but treat him somewhat kindly and the Greyjoys who despise him as a symbol of weakness and failure. Since he finds he cannot fully be a Stark, he tries to be a Greyjoy, only to realize too late that he chose wrong.
</li><li> In one of the <em>Histories and Lore</em> segments, Stannis describes the choice between his lawful king and his elder brother as the hardest choice he ever made. Since he is both of these to Renly, he views Renly's refusal to support him as doubly treacherous.
</li><li> Walder Frey parleys the question of loyalty to the king vs. loyalty to his lord into an advantageous deal with Robb Stark in "Baelor".
</li><li> After the invasion of Westeros doesn't go quite as planned, Daenerys accuses Tyrion of deliberately pulling his punches because he doesn't want to kill his family. The truth is more complicated. Tyrion wants Jaime to live (being the only Lannister left who ever actually loved Tyrion), but doesn't give a damn about Cersei, who would kill him on the spot. However, in the Season 7 finale Cersei doesn't have him killed, and he instinctively gives her a goblet of wine to share.

She very much wants to assist the Inquisition in stopping the eponymous Jaws of Hakkon, which is another Avvar hold whose members keep attacking the Inquisition soldiers (and who are clearly up to something big and problematic). However, her hold has a peace agreement with the Hakkonites, and if she went back on that, other holds would see hers as being filled with oathbreakers. She therefore tasks the Inquisitor with finding her a <em>really good reason</em> for her to break the peace agreement without damaging her hold's reputation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They do, when it's revealed that the Hakkonites kidnapped Stone-Bear Hold's sacred animal.</span>

Then Shepard comes along and wins her loyalty by treating her as her own person and helping her out with a personal issue without expecting anything in return.

It's ultimately up to the player which organization Shepard is more loyal to. Renegade!Shepard is loyal to humanity alone, and sees the Citadel Council and their resources as a means to an end; Paragon!Shepard wants humanity to <em>join</em> the Citadel Council, and believes in cooperation between all species. This is highlighted when Shepard must seek the help of several non-human allies—the krogan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Urdnot Wrex</a>, the turian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCop">Garrus Vakarian</a>, the quarian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Tali'zorah nar Rayya</a>, and the asari <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Liara T'Soni</a>—to stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>; some of the <em>Normandy</em>'s crew are uneasy with the new arrivals, wondering whether their Commander is still loyal to <em>them</em>.

After witnessing many people suffering after the Gohma's recent attack, Yasha sided with Deus. It got worse for Yasha since his sister Durga (Asura's wife and Mithra's mother) was also killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though it's unclear whether Deus ordered it or Sergei did it on his own just to anger Asura</span>. 12,000 years later, Yasha has to make the choice again when Asura returns, hell-bent on saving Mithra.

Following the Cataclysm, the previously player friendly Zandalari trolls have decided that they will rebuild the troll civilization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOfftheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOfftheSlipperySlope">at any costs</a>, to which end they start making alliances with all the various barbaric troll tribes scattered throughout Azeroth, including the Horde aligned Darkspear Trolls,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> whose leader refuses the offer in a very much awesome manner:</span>

As the months pass, Garrosh becomes more and more unhinged, turning into a dictator with fewer and fewer qualms about executing noncombatants or even fellow Horde members. Thrall's response to this is... nonexistent; nothing is done about it. Vol'jin and Garrosh had never liked each other, and following Garrosh simply attempting to have Vol'jin killed in secret, Vol'jin is again approached by the Zandalari. The troll attempting to recruit him this time is doing so without direct orders to do so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">because she admired the strength it took to defy the Zandalari last time</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero">she truly believes he's getting a raw deal from the Horde these days</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMrBondIExpectYouToDine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMrBondIExpectYouToDine">She holds his friends hostage in order to make him listen to her pitch</a>, but admits she's willing to defy orders and let them go if it helps sway him.

</li><li> When Wanda begins "decrypting" people (think a creepy form of resurrection) using the divine Arkenpliers, this happens a lot. The decrypted are automatically loyal to her, but retain all their old memories. While they are compelled to serve her above all else, this can cause serious friction with their old Loyalty.

Brought up as an heir in the Goodkind family to hate mutants and know they are a threat to everything one should care about. Then Phase manifests as a mutant and ends up at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool">Whateley Academy</a> and in Team Kimba, where he is expected to support mutants and hate the Goodkind family. He's loyal to his family even after what they did to him. He's loyal to his friends and has risked his life for them.
</li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber">Echo Chamber</a></em> episode is based on this trope. Dana tries to produce both <em>Echo Chamber</em> and its rival series <em>[citation needed]</em> at the same time, hoping she won't be forced to choose between the two shows.
</li><li> For the first eight arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, Taylor struggles between doing the right thing and betraying the only real friends she's has in years, a gang of supervillains that she has infiltrated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She picks her friends.</span>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, Karai's loyalty to the Foot and her father will often clash with her loyalty to the turtles, who helped her restore the Foot when she asked for their aid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>
<ul><li> There's an example of this in the third season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mai has to choose between her love of Zuko and her fear of Azula in "Boiling Rock," and chooses her love of Zuko. When Azula goes to kill her for this, Ty Lee makes a quick choice between her friendship-based love of Mai and <em>her</em> fear of Azula, and she <em>also</em> chooses the love. Either Azula isn't really that scary (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">which, let's be honest, isn't completely true</a>), or both of her friends are much more loyal (to other people) than Azula previously thought.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Zuko</a> goes through this throughout the entire third season. He's finally got everything he's ever wanted, but he's betrayed the only family who cared for him. Team Avatar, his <em>enemies</em>, care more for him then his father and sister do. And then we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his grandfathers are not just Fire Lord Sozin but also Avatar Roku, splitting him even further. He finally chooses Team Avatar and his uncle - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">a decision which ultimately pays off in spectacular style</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Anything involving the Supertrooper project on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Galaxy Rangers</a></em> will send Shane Gooseman, the team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Lancer</a>, straight to this trope. Goose was the youngest of the Troopers, and the only one who remained loyal to Earth's government after the disaster that ended the project. His loyalty was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">"rewarded" by BETA</a> forcing him into becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfHisOwnKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfHisOwnKind">Hunter of His Own Kind</a>. It's not so much of an issue with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Kilbane, but a much bigger problem when it came to Darkstar (who just wanted to be left alone with her boyfriend), and Max Sawyer (who may or may not have been guilty of the crimes he was charged with).
</li><li> This was exploited in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> by General Eiling, who used Captain Atom's loyalty to the USA to pit him against Superman while Cadmus tortured the Question for information. Captain Atom got a good beating for his trouble, and went back to the League in short order.
</li><li> Kaldur/Aqualad went through this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode "Downtime", wondering if he should stay on the team or return home to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a> where his crush Tula was. This was eventually resolved when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he found out Tula was already in a relationship with his best friend Garth and he decided to pull an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a></span> and thus return to Young Justice in good terms.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> villain Discord manipulates Rainbow Dash this way by tricking her into thinking she has to make a choice - stay and play the game by the rules or retake her wings and fly off to save her hometown from being destroyed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She picks the latter, and Discord uses this as an excuse to declare the game over because <em>someone cheated.</em> Not that it mattered anyway, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">regardless of which choice she made</a>, she'd play into his hand by betraying something she cares about and going against her Element Of Harmony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">which was Discord's intention</a>.</span>
<ul><li> <em>Rainbow Falls</em> has a decidedly less sadistic version where Rainbow Dash is forced to choose between her loyalty to her friends and the Ponyville Team (which, to not mince words, <em>sucks</em>), and her loyalty to the Wonderbolts and their team.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em>, Ms. Marvel becomes the first superhero to work for two teams: The Avengers and SWORD. This fact comes to a head when Hawkeye becomes accused of being a Skrull in disguise, and Ms. Marvel risks harming her relationships with the Avengers if she turns him in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity">Motorcity</a></em>: While Julie definitely believes in the Burners' cause over that of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">Archnemesis Dad</a> Kane's by a long shot, she still wants to believe that her father can be a good person and wants him to be proud of her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That might be why she agrees to succeed him if something should happen to him.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Peridot initially cooperates with the Crystal Gems in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> because she's in just as much danger from a world ending superweapon called the Cluster as they are. In the process, she grows to like both the Earth and the Crystal Gems, but she never loses her loyalty to Homeworld or her leader, Yellow Diamond. This results in Peridot trying to convince Yellow Diamond to terminate the Cluster and spare the Earth without exposing the existence of the Crystal Gems. When Yellow Diamond fails to be swayed by the objective logic Peridot prizes and reveals that no potential benefit outweighs her desire to see Earth gone, Peridot's conflict resolves itself in the form of her calling Yellow Diamond a clod, Peridot's trademark insult.

<ul><li> At Noverra in 1499, the King of France was invading Italy and met a local Prince. Both happened to have Swiss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">mercenaries</a> and it was decided that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">"kinslaying"</a> wouldn't do, but both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">had their contracts</a>. The Swiss officers on both sides met secretly. The agreement was that the ones on the Italian side would defer, but that the ones on the French side would spirit the Italian prince away by disguising him as a soldier in a sort of inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">I Am Spartacus</a>. The French King's general offered gold to whomever would betray the Italian prince, and finally, one did. This man was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">beheaded</a> by the Swiss government for disgracing Swiss arms. See <em>The Mercenaries</em> by Anthony Mockler.
</li><li> The Thebans at Thermopylae were a curious clash between one interpretation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a> and another. The Thebans were all exiles, yet stood and fought beside the 300 Spartans. In other words they put the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">honor</a> of their city ahead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">laws</a> of their city.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> in the Whiskey Rebellion. As the hero of the American Revolution, he had a certain sympathy for people revolting against being taxed (particularly as he was himself a rural distiller—albeit one for whom paying the excise was not particularly onerous); as the President of the United States, he had a duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws made under it, including the tax laws. He resolved the conflict by exercising the office of President: as President, he led an army that captured the rebels; as President, he put them on trial for treason; and when they were convicted, as President he pardoned every one of them.
</li><li> In his social history <em>A History of Honor</em> James Bowman suggests that Western Civilization is based on an uneasy tension between Christian values, old fashioned tribal/aristocratic values (and though he doesn't mention it, or not much, Greco-Roman Civic values) that formed something of a yin-yang which was ultimately quite fortunate. In his opinion the "Victorian Gentleman" was an attempt at compromising between these.
</li><li> Many soldiers and sailors fighting for both the Federals and Confederates during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>.
<ul><li> Sam Houston, considered one of the founding fathers of Texas and the 1st and 3rd president of the Republic of Texas (and many other things as well), was forced to resign as governor of Texas when he refused to take the oath of loyalty to the Confederacy. When the US Army offered him a commission to lead an army and stop the rebellion in Texas, he refused. He was very pro-union, but he could not bring himself to cause misery to the people of Texas.
</li><li> Robert E. Lee loved the United States and loved Virginia. He was even offered the position that eventually became Grant's during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a>, but turned it down because it meant he'd be attacking his fellow Virginians, who ultimately chose to side with the Confederacy.
</li></ul></li><li> The early days of the Irish War of Independence constituted this for many Irish policemen, who were primary targets of the IRA. As one history book put it, "the Irish policemen needed to decide if their loyalty lay with the British who paid their wages, or their fellow Irishmen who were shooting at them." Even more pronounced in the Irish Civil War (which began less than a year after the end of the War of Independence, and was the culmination of tensions which had been building since that time), which, as a result of the split in the IRA, meant that many men who had been comrades only a short time before were now fighting one another. It has been speculated that part of the reason the anti-government forces got such an early foothold was because Michael Collins was unwilling to use maximum force against people who had recently been his close friends.
</li><li> In medieval times, it was possible for a minor noble to swear fealty to multiple overlords. To simplify matters when this trope came into play, such fealty contracts would often include statements on the order of "If liege A should go to war against liege B, I shall send X men-at-arms to fight for A, and fight with the rest of my troops alongside B".
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Great Reformation</a>, Protestant monarchs were often suspicious of their Catholic subjects because of conflicting loyalties that could arise between obedience to their king or to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a>.
<ul><li> This was actually a source of prejudice in the United States against Catholic politicians. During his 1960 campaign for President, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> made several statements to reassure people that he was not running to be a Catholic President but a President who was also Catholic, and that neither he nor the Church spoke for one another.
<div class="indent">"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters  and the Church does not speak for me."
</div></li></ul></li><li> Many codes of professional ethics direct their practitioners to avert this trope. For instance, judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have some tie to one side of the case that might raise questions about their impartiality.
<ul><li> Much of the lawyer code of professional ethics are rules entirely dedicated to what constitutes a conflict of loyalty, how to avoid conflicts of loyalty, and how conflicts of loyalty can be resolved if they arise.
