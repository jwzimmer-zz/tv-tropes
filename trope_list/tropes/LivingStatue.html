Common roles they fulfill are as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGranite">guardians</a> of places of importance, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedLandmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedLandmark">doomsday devices</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight">Hidden in Plain Sight</a>, and as (wanted or unwanted, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot">romantic partners</a>. The size of living statues and the material they're made from, which is usually stone or metal, means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">immense strength and endurance</a> are a likelihood as long as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a> is not in effect. How a living statue comes to be differs per story.
</p><p>In case the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife">origin lies with the statue</a>, a regular statue is cursed, enchanted, or haunted. The latter is particularly likely to happen between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">the statue likeness and the soul of the same person</a>. A special case is when the statue doesn't necessarily house the soul, but does serve as its anchor. This always requires the statue to be of the soul's owner. Think of it as a statue being in a permanent state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection">Astral Projection</a>. In some cases, the statue doesn't just anchor the soul, but is what calls it back from the dead.

Another possibility is for a statue to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedGolems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedGolems">starting material</a> for either. All that said, the distinction between a living statue and a golem is flimsy. Generally speaking, a living statue has an artistic element to it that informs its shape, whereas a golem will be more rudimentary of form.
</p><p>A third possibility is for someone to be turned into a statue. Take note that if this is a regular statue it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a>, which is not a living statue, while if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">they retain their awareness but cannot move</a> the result is a living statue. In the opposite scenario, where a statue being brought to life becomes organic, it still qualifies as a living statue until it takes successfully part in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinocchioSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinocchioSyndrome">Pinocchio Syndrome</a> plot.

Kali statues are a notable example of that, foregoing the actual goddess in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythcharacterized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythcharacterized">her image</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09fxd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09fxd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09fxd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The origin of this appears to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GungaDin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GungaDin">Gunga Din</a></em>, which doesn't feature a living statue but does create an association between Kali(like) statues and the occult.</span> Another noteworthy case of living statues occurs when a mythological creature is exclusively present in history as a statue. While the creature may not be meant to be a living statue, the association is a strong one and fiction may choose to merge the two. Gargoyles and other grotesques are the prime example of this phenomenon.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories">Ghost Stories</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Ninomiya statue is the very first ghost encountered in the series, and while scary seemingly not hostile. It stands outside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSchoolBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSchoolBuilding">Old School Building</a>, but later is found on the second floor wearing Momoko's hat. Hajime retrieves the hat, obtusely asserting it's just a statue, when it opens its eyes and closes its book. The children make a run for it.
</li><li> The ending credits depict a Hyakki Yagyou in which a Ninomiya statue participates.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Gakkou no Kaidan (Anime Video Joukan)</em>, Ninomiya Kinjiro is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHost">eight hosts</a> presenting the horror story segments. He does not appear in the story segments himself. He and Hanako are in love but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwiceShy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwiceShy">Twice Shy</a>, while the rest of the group totally supports them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto">Junji Ito</a>'s <em>Bronze Statue</em> multitasks the premise of living statues made through lost-wax casting and has one case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a>.
<ul><li> The first example is a fake-out, because the bust in Seidou City Central Park that the children know talks actually contains video and audio equipment through which the rich selfmade widow Sonobe eavesdrops on park-goers. The "talking statue" depicts her in her long-gone prime. It's contrasted by the bust of her husband, which depicts him as he was at the time of creation, two years before his murder. When Sonobe overhears four women mock her for her vanity, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">kills them with the help of her vaguely romantic partner-in-crime, the sculptor Tsuchiya</a>.
</li><li> About a week later, the children ask the "talking statue" if she knows where their mothers are. Sonobe lies, but example two occurs as suddenly her husband's bust speaks and reveals Sonobe as a murderer.
</li><li> Distraught, Sonobe searches the pond in her backyard for her husband's corpse and hands it to Tsuchiya for burning. He, however, notices the body has turned into adipocere and sculpts it into the form of a handsome young man (which Sonobe guesses depicts Tsuchiya in his younger days). He uses it as the basis for a bronze statue, which he gifts to Sonobe. Sonobe is elated and places it next to a full body statue of her younger self. Then, for example number three, both statues come to life and tell Sonobe to go away because they want alone time. Sonobe's warning to her younger self is met with derision, because a statue never ages.
</li><li> Inspired, Sonobe writes a letter to Tsuchiya, explaining that she'll kill herself in the pond and requesting him to retrieve her in three years and use the adipocere to create a beautiful statue of gold of her. At his end from the harsh working conditions, Tsuchiya stays alive long enough to create the plaster cast, but dies before he can add the gold, leaving Sonobe's spirit trapped inside.

Among the mysteries is a Ninomiya statue, who is the only one convinced they should keep on haunting the school because it is their duty as the local ghosts. He vows to continue opening his eyes at four o'clock no matter what, inspiring the other mysteries. The next day, the school administration has the statue removed because parents complained it encouraged children to walk and read simultaneously, which is dangerous to do.

As it turns out, they're dealing with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent">lamassu</a> and the head asks to be reunited with its body. They help him out, only to discover the lamassu is truly evil and now back to full power. Out of gratitude, it lets them ride him and if they can stay on he'll let them go.

None of the three manage to stay on, but when a storm rolls in they see a chance to have the lamassu hit by lightning, causing it to split apart and the curse to be lifted.

Nube isn't convinced of this because Ninomiya is a god of studying and therefore a benevolent youkai, so he seemingly refuses to help. Makoto then sets a trap for the statue, almost casting it to the bottom of the river, when Nube jumps in to save it. He reveals it isn't Ninomiya who's hunting the boy, but the vengeful ghost of a neighboring town's teacher who died due to a student's prank.

They do so to punish a group of ruthless templerobbers and save their hostage, Papyrus. However, the statues (and the weather) go out of control when one of the thieves "kills" the "high priest". Theti rushes into the chaos to retrieve Papyrus. The two almost get stepped on by one of the statues, but at Theti's scream, it halts midwalk, topples, and breaks, providing an in-story explanation why the second Abu Simbel statue is as it is today. When the storm has died down, the statues are already back in their seats at the temple.
</li><li> "The Dark Goddess of Doom", published in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ghosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ghosts">Ghosts</a></em> #3, is an adaptation of "The Venus of Ille". Rather than a marble statue of Venus, it stars a bronze statue of Kali. Said statue is illegally obtained by Chris Morton, who manages an art collection as investment plan. He also gains much of his wealth by fooling women. One of them has finally seen through Chris's lies and throws him back the engagement ring. In jest, Chris places the ring on Kali's statue, exclaiming that only the Queen of Evil would do for him. That night, the statue comes to live and squeezes Chris to death. It's left up to the reader whether the statue acted out of vengeance or love.
</li><li> Published in <em>Plop!</em> #5, "Molded in Evil" presents the story of a famous Parisian sculptor, Pierre Gouny, whose speciality is gargoyles. In his spare time, he's developed a potion to bring his statues to life. His first creation is a silly bird he immediately dotes, but which is destroyed by his wife who is unaware of Pierre's invention. She orders him to only make gargoyles, since those bring in money. Seeking revenge Pygmalion-style, Pierre sets out to create a new wife to run off with. However, still unaware of the life added to the clay, Clothilde again destroys the statue while Pierre is away. This time, he murders her for it. Pierre opts to hide the body within one of the gargoyles she wanted him to create so badly. He doesn't realize he's using his treated clay until the creature attacks him.

In the end, Detective Max Dorne's one chance at saving himself and the judge comes down to killing Edward by throwing a paperweight into his face.
</li><li> The statue in "Terror of the Sleeping Monster!", published in <em>Mystrious Adventures</em> #5, is not directly alive, but rather the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemoteBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemoteBody">other body</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampire</a> who was killed and can now only exist as long as there's a perfect, immutable likeness of his old body around. His spirit, meanwhile, can take over any human and make it look like him. The statue is the work of a sculptor the vampire, Sharal Maroff, tricked and gave a magical chisel. Once the sculptor understands he made a grae mistake, he uses the chisel to destroy the statue, which forces the Maroff's spirit back into the realm of the dead.
</li><li> The rivaling sculptors Raimondo and Cavitti in "His Final Glory" each try to create the most beautiful statue known to Italy. Raimondo's created a mighty stallion, while Cavitti's marble-ized the likeness of Liana, the woman Raimondo loves. Most people are certain Cavitti will be judged the better sculptor, so in rage Raimondo swears he'd give anything to outdo Cavitti. Then his own stallion statue come to life, possessed it seems by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Mephistopheles</a>, and asks if he means it.

The statue does become a person, but not because of Pellas's selfishness. It's Phidias's dedication that originated her and so she loves him.

Gene wants to get rid of it ASAP, but Ralph comes under the flower's influence, going from feeding it insects, to mice, to dogs, to people. The souls of those eaten become the Orchid Goddess's spirit tigers. In the end, Gene destroys the orchid and therefore the Droseracea's danger to America.

Though both lost their lives in the procedure, the statue did come to life. Its strength was no match for the Destroyer's, though, and in the end life was knocked out of him by a big explosion.
</li><li> "Heart of the Snow Maiden" in <em>Adventures into the Unknown</em> #40 features one ice sculpture and one (probably) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">ice elemental</a>. The sculpture, the Snow Maiden, has no feelings for the elemental, the Ice King, which he is fine with as long as she doesn't love another either. But she falls in love with a human twice. The first time, the Ice King kills the entire human village and the Snow Maiden with an avalanche.

The Snow Maiden then banishes herself from society to avoid the Ice King's ire from befalling anyone ever again.

She and the sculptor Ray Manning have a difficult relation, and after a fight Eve leaves only to die in a plane crash. Distraught, Ray abandons all his commissions to perfectly recreate Eve's image in stone. Unbeknownst to him, this forces back her spirit. She doesn't mind at first, until Ray, persuaded by Eve's stardom and his need for money, agrees to rent the statue for window display purposes. This angers Eve's spirit and she shows herself to instruct Ray to destroy her likeness. He does so, looking like a burglar and vandal in the process. Running from the police, he's hit by a car and subsequently reunited with Eve in death.
</li><li> "The Statue!", published in <em>Ghostly Tales</em> #99, is a humorous deconstruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot">Pygmalion Plot</a>.

</li><li> In "And a Sea Specter Answered" of <em>Ghosts</em> #72, close friends Wendy and Phyllis are on vacation in Greece. Wendy asks the Oracle of Delphi what's in store for her and the spirit of Poseidon himself warns her not to disturb those who sleep in the depths. Wendy takes it seriously, but not Phyllis, who didn't even see the spirit. Phyllis later buys a mass-produced statuette of the son of Poseidon, much to Wendy's displeasure as she feels watched by it. Phyllis also convinces Wendy to go wreck-diving with her. Following a sudden tremor, they find a human-sized version of the statuette Phyllis bought and she comes close to examine it. It comes to life and grabs her. With andrenaline-improved strength, Wendy wrenches her friend free, but then then the statue grabs her instead and another tremor recloses the surrounding rock. Phyllis reaches the surface, but Wendy and the statue are never seen again.

<ul><li> The first third of <em>The Metal Pig</em> is all about the statues of Florence. The titular pig is the Il Porcellino fountain. One night, a poor boy falls asleep on its back and wakes up to the pig running off with him. The pig explains that it can only come to life when an innocent child rides him. It takes the boy on a tour past all the statues, architecture, paintings, and frescos the city holds dear, each of which comes to life, whether fully or partially. This instills a love for art in the boy, which later sets him on the path of drawing. Yet the boy is never again able to ride his dear friend the pig and it's left ambiguous whether that one night he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">dreamed</a> or if he's lost his innocence (he's noted to have teased a dog shortly after his ride on the pig).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHappyPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHappyPrince">The Happy Prince</a></em>, a deceased prince's spirit has taken up residence within the bejeweled and gold-coated statue erected of him. In life, he wasn't allowed to know unhappiness and was kept from the people, which makes him suffer all the more when as a statue he sees pain but can't do anything about it. By chance, when summer's gone, he meets a sparrow whom he cajoles into scouting the city for him and bringing the jewels and gold to those who need it. Once all is given away, he bids the sparrow to leave before the cold comes, but it's well too late for the sparrow to escape and it dies at the prince's feet. Its corpse causes people to notice in how bad a shape the prince's statue is and they melt it down in the same oven they throw the sparrow's remains into. By some manner of fortune, this means the two are welcomed in heaven together.

Recalling the story of Pygmalion, she prays to the Goddess of Love to bring her statue to life too. It works.

His ship is caught by the pull of the mountain island made of lodestone that has wrecked many a ship. At the top of the mountain stands a brass dome that holds up the brass statue of a man on horseback. The man has a plate of lead with incantations attached to his chest and as long as he stands, the island will make victims. Prince Agib survives the sea and makes it to the top of the mountain, where he falls asleep and in his dream is advised to dig up a brass bow and three leaden arrows and shoot the man with it. If done right, the man will fall off his horse into the sea below and the horse will topple off the dome. The horse then is to be buried where the bow was dug up, which will cause the sea to rise up to the dome and another statue similar to the one shot down to come get the prince by boat.

The next day while strolling around outside, she comes across a statue and orders it to dance. The statue needs a few seconds to learn to move, but is ecstatic about it and wordlessly asks permission for the other statues to dance along. Beauty grants this, leading to a musical number about dancing as all the statues join in.
</li><li> In a shock-induced hallucination, Freder of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> imagines the eight statues of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a> he'd seen in the cathedral earlier come to life. The Reaper plays the bone flute while the other statues fade out of existence. Then the Reaper swings his scythe and cries out: "Death descends upon the city — !" before Freder snaps out of it.
</li><li> The short <em>Statues Come to Life</em> takes inspiration from the Indian folklore that states that "when the sun sets, and the moonlight rains down, the temple figurines come to life and dance for gods' amusement". A boy and his sister observe a temple in secret until moonlight hits the two statues at the entrance, resulting in an Odissi dance performance. When the statues notice their non-divine audience, they return them safely to their home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pulgasari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pulgasari">Pulgasari</a></em> has the titular Pulgasari. He started out as a statuette molded from rice by an elderly blacksmith who was sent to prison by the tyrannical king. Before dying, he begs the gods to make his creation a living creature that protects the people against the king. Later, the blacksmith's daughter gets the statuette and a drop of her blood brings the creature to life. It is she who names the new lifeform Pulgasari, after a story by her father about a metal-eating monster because that's what Pulgasari does: eat metal and grow huge. He is vital in ensuring the rebellion's success, but becomes a problem after that because he won't stop eating metal or growing. The blacksmith's daughter sacrifices herself by hiding inside a bell that Pulgasari eats, which undoes the magic animating Pulgasari.

<ul><li> In Japan, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">bodhisattva</a> Kṣitigarbha is known as Jizō Bosatsu, protector of all who died before reaching adulthood. Jizō statues, sometimes rows of them, are commonly founds along roads, in particular near shrines and graveyards, so of course there are plenty of tales about these being more than mere statues. Sometimes they aid, sometimes they laugh, sometimes they prank, sometimes they appear and disappear, sometimes they stalk, and sometimes they attack. The collective name for statues that act this way is "Bake-Jizō", "bake" being a term for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> that undergo a transformation, which in this case is from normal statue to living statue.

</li><li> Ninomiya Kinjirō (later in life Ninomiya Sontoku) was a 19th Century peasant who combined his time working the land with study, eventually working himself up to a noted agricultural leader, philosopher, moralist and economist who received honors unusual to someone of his social origin. Many schools in Japan have a statue of him reading a book while carrying wood on his back to inspire the students to similar greatness. Ninomiya's statue coming to life is one of the many school ghost stories and regularly featured in works of fiction, usually as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries">The Seven Mysteries</a>.
</li><li> In Korea, the statue commonly seen at schools is of Ryu Gwan-sun, a woman who at age 16 was an organizer of the March 1st Movement against the Japanese occupation. She was imprisoned, tortured, and died in 1920 at age 17, never giving up on the fight. A symbol due to her young age, her statues reoccurrence is to inspire the students to heroism like hers. The ghost story regarding it is that every March 1st, her statue walks around chanting "Long Live Korean Independence".
</li><li> The South Asian tale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourTravelers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourTravelers">The Four Travelers</a></em> is about the wooden statue of a beautiful woman created by four men. The carpenter sculpted her, the tailor made her clothes, the goldsmith made her jewelry, and the ascetic asked Allah to bring her to life. When she is alive, they fight over her, each claiming ownership on account of their contribution. They choose to settle the matter by means of an arbiter, which ends up being the Tree of Knowledge. The tree splits open and the woman steps inside to return to her origins. The tree then closes.

<ul><li> There's an old joke involving this trope. There's a pair of statues in a park who for decades have been frozen in a position of looking longingly toward each other. One day, an angel descends and grants them life for an hour. They rush off into the bushes and there's much rustling and giggling. When they emerge after a half hour, the angel reminds them they have more time whereupon the male statue turns to the female one and says, "OK, this time <strong>I</strong> hold down the pigeon and <strong>you</strong> shit on it."

Freder eventually snaps out of it and later returns to the cathedral, where he curiouslt finds the statue of the Reaper gone. It's left ambiguous if the Reaper is active or if the statue is just undergoing repairs.
</li><li> Preceding "The Venus of Ille" is "The Ring" by Thomas Moore, in which the statue is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemoteBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemoteBody">two bodies controlled</a> by an unnamed regal female entity, who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">either supernatural or undead</a>. A man named Rupert is soon to be married and while out playing tennis with his friends, he's afraid he might break or lose the wedding ring. He places it on the finger of a marble statue for safekeeping, but when he returns to retrieve it he sees the finger bend and lock the ring in place. Not wanting to seem mad to his friends, he leaves it be and returns at night to break it off if need be, but the wedding ring is straight up gone. He gets another ring and lets whatever this is be, but at his wedding night finds a phantom between him and his bride. Neither of them can see it, but Rupert can feel and hear it, learning from the voice that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">she whom he gave the wedding ring at the tennis court</a>. Rupert goes to ask what possibly is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a> himself to annul the marriage. He is compliant and tells the spectre in his entourage whose looks are identical to the statue to let Rupert go. Sadly, she returns the ring and declares the two of them no longer married.
</li><li> "The Venus of Ille" by Prosper Mérimée: A man puts a ring on the finger of an ancient statue; she becomes possessive of him and takes revenge when he gets married by squeezing him to death between her arms and legs during the wedding night. The statue is melted down and turned into church bells afterwards, but it's stated the crops froze twice in the years since.
</li><li> The poem <em>The Bronze Horseman</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a> deals with the equestrian statue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a> in the Senate Square in Saint Petersburg. Upon the death of his beloved in a storm, a man by the name of Evgenii curses the statue of Peter to which the statue responds by coming to life, giving chase, and killing him. Incidentally, the popularity of this poem is why the statue nowadays is known as the Bronze Horseman.
</li><li> <em>My Laughing Philosopher</em> by Eden Phillpotts deals with a man who purchases an antique bronze bust that he learns is alive a week later when it sneezes upon smoke reaching its face. The bust is nameless, but referred to as my Laughing Philosopher or my Laugher by the unnamed man. The bust was created in Greece when the country was young and brought to Egypt when the country was old. It was in Egypt that it was given life with "magic from the mornig of the world". That is, once every 500 years it gains the ability to speak the language of its then-owner to communicate with them only for fifty midnights to exchange viewpoints. The rest of the time, the bust is aware but separate from humanity. It arrived in England fifty to sixty years before the events of the book and this marked its first visit to said county. "Laughing Philospher" is a title given because the bust is a philosopher and old enough that no sentiment remains but laughter. The bust's owner argues that if he were a full statue with a heart, he would have been left with more than laughter, but the bust disagrees and over the course of fifty midnights helps the man understand him.

He went on a quest to free people who'd been turned to stone and had to fetch water from an enchanted spring to fix them. He was offered the choice of using a plain or a gem-encrusted ladle to fetch the water, and realized that the second one had to be a trap. However, he presumed it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong">couldn't hurt</a> to just <em>look</em> at the fancy ladle, which started turning him to stone before he even tried to use it.

Statues are divided between Spits and Taints, which are at war. "Spit" is from "spitting image" and is the group comprised of statues of historical people which soul copies inhabit them. Taints are all other statues and they are soulless. Of course, there's a few who've switched sides, a few that are in-between and, of course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">spits are the heroes</a>.

The real Charley is just a statue that John Eastlake used to mark the grave of the victims of Perse. But Charley as a living creature was also one of the first things Perse made Elizabeth draw into reality. Ever since, the Eastlake children have been afraid of Charley and in the present Perse has made its image one of the main guards of her hiding place. This Charley is larger than the actual statue, being about five and a half feet tall, and it moves around rapidly by means of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGlide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGlide">Ghostly Glide</a> because it cannot move its limbs.

</li><li> Mayka, a young girl, is the titular protagonist of <em>The Stone Girl's Story</em>. She is the last living statue created by the stonemason she and her siblings now only as Father. Father's first creation was Turtle (turle), and between him and Mayka he also created a school of fish, Badger (badger), Jacklo and Risa (two birds), Nianna (owl), Dersey and Harlisona (two rabbits), Kalgrey (cat), and Etho (lizard). Their life comes from storified personalities carved into their stone and various capabilities like speech and high jumping are granted by symbols placed on the appropriate body parts. At the start of the story, Father has been long dead and the statues are suffering fading and chipped marks. Turtle, the oldest, and most of the fish, which suffer erosion worse, have already "gone to sleep". Seeing as they are all doomed if nothing changes, Mayka sets off from the secluded mountain they live on to find a stonemason to fix them in the city of Skye in the valley below, from which Father originated. She estimates it should take her a week, but once in Skye she finds that the living statues there are servants to their organic keepers by means of an enslaving mark. From this horrific lesson also follows understanding that she and her stone kind have freedom of interpretation when it comes to the stories that give them existence, which changes the relationship between the stone and the flesh creatures for the better.
</li><li> Two stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ENesbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ENesbit">E. Nesbit</a> deal with living statues:
<ul><li> In <em>Man-Size in Marble</em>, Brenzett in England is the location of a church that houses two marble statues that mark the final resting places of those they are sculpted after: two knights who terrorized the area in their time. Although their names are lost to time, the legend goes their deeds were so foul that their home was struck by lightning as a form of divine intervention. That same legend also says that on 11 o'clock on All Saints' Eve, the statues get up and visit the location of their former home, where nowadays a cottage stands. Any who meets them won't be there for sunrise. Of course, the narrator, who rented the cottage with his wife Laura, believed nothing of it and chose not to tell Laura either because of her frail state of mind at the time. Come All Saints' Eve and he felt like going for a walk, happening upon the church past 11 o'clock and noticing the statues gone. Once back home, he found Laura dead, though still clutching a marble finger in her hand.
</li><li> The marble statues of the manor in <em>The Enchanted Castle</em> come to life in moonlight, but humans can't see them do that. The only way to get in on the spell is to wear the magic ring or to use the ring to wish yourself to be a statue for the duration of the night. The statues know of this and if given the chance happily welcome humans and instruct them how to use the ring properly. The statues represent dinosaurs and Greek deities and by the rules of their magic are all (this includes statue-fied guests) athletically gifted. Each night, they enjoy a divine banquet on an island they swim to.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Haunted Mask</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em>, Carly Beth Caldwell receives a plaster bust in her image from her mother. She doesnt think much of it, but takes it along trick-or-treating as a decapitated head prop to go along with the theme of her new horrifying mask. Something of a supernatural identity split occurs as the mask slowly takes over her body from her sense of self, while her actual self finds residence within the bust. When Carly confronts her two bullies, the bust cries out to them begging for help.
</li><li> <em>The Ice Maiden's Tale</em> by Lisa Preziosi revisits the myth of Galatea with an ice sculpture. She is carved from a block of ice by Gabriel, who had a vision of her appearance and a dream about her asking him to set her free. However, Gabriel can't get rid of the feeling he has to do more for her than creating her and playing her songs, so he sets out on a journey to bring her to life. Shortly after he's left, the ice maiden is discovered by a wandering sorcerer, who also sets his mind to bringing her to life. None of the spells and potion recipes in his arsenal are enough for the gift of life, however, so he too sets out on a journey to bring her to life.
</li><li> In Dennis Etchison's short story "When They Gave Us Memory" a young man meets a struggling actor working as a living statue in his hometown. Later, after learning that his parents and friends have no memory of him, he finds that the living statue doesn't respond to him either. The fact that he and the statue are both actors gives the tale another level of eerie ambiguity.

<ul><li> The more famous one is the quintet of Singing Busts. They are named Rollo Rumkin, Uncle Theodore, Cousin Algernon, Ned Nub, and Phineas P. Pock, an they sing "Grim Grinning Ghosts" during the graveyard portion of the ride. Uncle Theodore's head has broken off and lies next to the bust.
</li><li> The other set is a quartet of Staring Busts, in scripts named Edgar Allan, Elizabeth Barrett, Alfred Lord, and Henry Wadsworth. They always stare at the guests no matter where they go and depending on the version, either all four reside in the library (that follows on the portrait corridor) or only two of them reside at the end of the portrait corridor. Elizabeth later appears in the grand hall, where she is located on the mantle in the embrace of a ghost.
</li><li> Both these sets may have descended from another bust that was part of the very early plans for the foyer. He'd have been the Ghost Host and before the eyes of the guests gone from looking normal with angel imagery to looking demonic with devil imagery. Some of this made it into <em>The Story and Song from The Haunted Mansion</em>, in which the protagonists hear the voice of the Ghost Host coming from a marble statue.
</li><li> Within the cemetery next to the queue in the Walt Disney World version, Leota has a gravestone in which her countenance is chiseled. On occasion, it opens its eyes and looks around.

<ul><li> There are gargoyles aplenty and they are made of stone and one expresses a dislike of pigeons, but whether they are true living statues or natural rock monsters is left unclear.

One is of an Egyptian woman (with a head modeled after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/NefertitiBust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/NefertitiBust">Nefertiti Bust</a>), the other is possibly of a Greek man, and the third is a small abstract figure. They're all made of a green material, which could either be jade, which a regular statue is said to be made of, or bronze with a thick layer of patina, as the abstract statue is unlikely to be jade. Destroying them is necessary to acquire a key.

It is a solitary cabana located on a small island. Painted on both sides of the front door is the image of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJeeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJeeves">valet</a>. There are also three wooden cutouts inside depicting said valet (one of them dressed as a maid). Either the valet specifically or the cabana as a whole is alive and talks to people who drop by, though it seemingly only shows respect to the rightful owner. It could be the cabana is haunted, because beneath it reside ReDeads.

Charles, turning it into a giant statue of <em>himself</em> so he can squash the heroes (and his former partner-in-crime Ozzie Mandrill).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>, the mines of Altin Peak overlap with an ancient temple that houses several living dragon-like statues. The common ones are green and called Living Statues, while the final one is purple and called the Hydros Statue. They are responsible for the high water level surrounding the mines, which is lowered each time a Living Statue is defeated. The Hydros Statue provides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a>. Beating it saves Altin and nets the protagonists the Lifting Gem for the ability to lift up large boulders.
</li><li> The first boss battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em> is of this type.

Fortunately he converts to travel-size before you have to fight him.
</li><li> There's a statue in the garden and four atlantes built into the terrace of New Swinestein of <em>Max and the Haunted Castle</em> that are all five alive. The garden statue is something of a gatekeeper of the castle and the atlantes like to be told stories and sometimes tire from holding up the roof.
</li><li> Two boss battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> are with giant monsters that you thought were statues until they stood up and came at you. Naturally the villains were looking for said statues the whole time to try and control them.

The duo head over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hachiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hachiko">Hachiko</a> and, deciding it's <em>filthy</em>, proceed to polish it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As they continue to polish, the statue gradually turns silver, gains blue streaks, and growls menacingly. Turns out the curse was a pack of canine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Noise</a> possessing the statue.</span>
</li><li> Living statues are a regular enemy in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series.
<ul><li> The last two levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII">Tomb Raider II</a></em>, the Floating Islands and the Dragon's Lair, are mystical realms guarded by jade warriors seemingly based on both the real-life Terracotta Army and the mythological guards of the Heavenly Palace of the Jade Emperor. They appear as regular statues until approached and then break out of their jade shell. They have grey skin, "mechanical" footsteps, and become jade again when killed.
</li><li> Inside the Temple Ruins of India in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em>, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">Multi-Armed and Dangerous</a> living statues about twice as tall as Lara herself. They carry scimitars, with which they attack but also block incoming bullets. The statues are undefined, but commonly referred to as "Shiva Statues" by the fandom. However, their appearance and behavior make them much more a rudimentary depiction of Kali.
</li><li> The area of Rome in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles">Tomb Raider Chronicles</a></em> features three kinds of living statues. The first is a trio of serpents, possibly gargoyles, which seem part of a gate until they slide out of their niches when all four keys are inserted. They still won't stray far from the gate and attack with fire bolts. The second is a full-body statue of a Roman soldier about twice as tall as a human. Lara encounters three of them. The first has a sword but doesn't come to life. The second has a sword too but does come to life. And the third comes to life armed with a hammer. The final type of living statue might actually be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robot">robot</a>. It's a huge head of a Roman soldier floating above a claw. It generates laser beams.
</li><li> Among the enemies found inside the Babylonian ruins of the Sahara in the Desert Ruins level of <em>Lara Croft: Relic Run</em> are the Stone Warriors, which were renamed Animated Golems in a later patch. They are armed with either throwing discs, whips, or fire projectiles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em> features a giant statue of Porky as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. It also appeared in one of the segments in the Subspace Emissary on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Brawl</em>.
</li><li> Compulsory <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> Regigigas was originally a Pok­émon that (somehow) was locked away in Snowpoint Temple. However people eventually forgot about it and it was thought to be a statue. When the player gathers Regirock, Regice and Registeel, Regigigas awakens and attacks. Its long time spent as a statue is shown in its ability, Slow Start.
<ul><li> It later appears in Clay Tunnel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>. It's the same deal as before.
</li><li> Also noteworthy is the boss battle in <em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky</em>'s Aegis Cave. Regigigas plus a slew of Bronzong and Hitmonlee that appear to be statues come to life and attack the player's party.
</li><li> Regigigas was also shown to have become statue-like in the 11th <em>Pokémon</em> movie before awakening to hold back a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">glacier</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Claydol, according to the <em>Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em> Pokédex, is "An ancient clay figurine that came to life as a Pokémon from exposure to a mysterious ray of light." By extension, this also applies to its unevolved form, Baltoy. There's also Nosepass, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EenieMeenieMinyMoai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EenieMeenieMinyMoai">Moai statue</a> mixed with a compass, as well as its evolved form Probopass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> were kind enough to give a better example in Golett and Golurk, genderless man-made Pok­émon of the Ground/Ghost type that look like animated guardian statues. They were built to protect the ancient civilizations of both people and Pokemon, and can even learn to Fly.
</li></ul></li><li> There's an unexplained bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying">Clive Barker's Undying</a></em> where to get to the upper floor of a room in Oneiros, the scrying spell must be used on the central statue. This causes it to expose a human heart in its chest and moan "Help me". The heart has to be attacked to retrieve it, after which blood pours out of the statue that raises the player to the upper level. The statue has parts that look like flesh, but its feet seem to emerge from stone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII">Grandia II</a></em> had statues of gargoyles at the start that broke open and turned into moving stone Gargoyles. In fact, it has a couple of times when statues or things in the walls come to life and attempt to kill you. Then it's subverted by having a suspiciously large statue in one of the towns that the characters comment on; when all hell breaks loose nothing happens apart from the main character shouting at it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a>: Defiance</em>, many of the reaver forges contain statue guardians that spend the first half of the level as inanimate decorations. Kain's narration shows that he knows damn well that they'll come alive before he leaves.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a>: Shattered Lands</em>. An evil defiler asks you to bring him several pieces missing from a statue. Once the statue is complete the defiler <em>lets</em> you kill him, which is a ploy because this allows him to occupy the statue. Either you fight the statue then and there or during the final battle.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> series features a recurring enemy class that depending on the game is called Living Statue, Great Keeper, Stone Guardian, or Ice Sculpture. No matter the name, they always look like a big man in a toga with one fist raised and one leg lifted. They cannot or only barely change this pose, but they can hop around to do damage by their sheer size and weight.
<ul><li> Stone Guardians and Living Statues are the common ones. Under these names, the creatures are made from stone. In its first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> only, Stone Guardians are a bright green, while later they'd be depicted as merely darker than Living Statues.
</li><li> Great Keepers only appear in four games, starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em>. They're made of gold.
</li><li> Ice Sculptures are unique to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestHeroesIITwinKingsAndTheProphecysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestHeroesIITwinKingsAndTheProphecysEnd">Dragon Quest Heroes II: Twin Kings And The Prophecy's End</a></em>. Needless to say, they're made of ice.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice">Sam &amp; Max Season 1</a></em> videogame episode "Abe Lincoln Must Die", the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln memorial is alive and ambulatory. And seeking re-election. Well, that <em>will not stand</em>! He makes several more appearances after that episode as just a head and no longer evil, and ends up marrying another recurring character.
</li><li> Titan is trapped in a statue in the town of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChocobosDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChocobosDungeon">Chocobo's Dungeon</a> 2</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em> makes frequent mention of a large monster that one of the characters turned to stone to save her kingdom. Sure enough, someone wakes it up again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>:
<ul><li> This happened to Odin and The Queen. Odin comes back to fight; The Queen just gives you tears from a stone.
</li><li> More noticeably, the Warring Triad (often referred to as "The Statues") which caused worldwide devastation in the War of the Magi 1000 years ago. They sealed themselves in stone voluntarily and set themselves in balance; breaking the balance breaks the world again. At the end of the game, the deities of the Triad are enslaved and robbed of their power by Kefka, allowing the party to finally destroy them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Miriam Guardians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. There are two types: tall, Egyptian looking statues and <em>giant heads</em> which seem to shout "Damn!" when you destroy them. The Clan Primer says that the heads are all that are left of massive ancient statues. In addition to those, there are the Demon Wall bosses in Raithwall's Tomb earlier on in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Actraiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Actraiser">Actraiser</a></em>: the Master (i.e. God, i.e. <em>you</em>) animates a statue to serve as an earthly avatar, and as the warrior with which to defeat the evil roaming the world.
</li><li> The second boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana">La-Mulana</a></em> is a reanimated statue of an extinct race of giants.
</li><li> Both the good and the evil variety appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfKay">Legend of Kay</a></em>. In keeping with the game's vaguely Chinese feel, the dungeon contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">clay warriors</a> that animate and attack when Kay gets too close. In the city above, Kay must reanimate two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">ancestor statues</a> to solve a puzzle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethack">Nethack</a></em> has statues which come to life as a regular trap in the lower levels. In fact, any statue that depicts a fleshy monster can be brought to life with the spell "stone to flesh".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, the mages encounter the immobile but speaking statue of Eleni Zinovia, an ancient Tevinter lady who has been turned to stone for delivering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a> prophecies, in their Origin story. She is then revisited in the <em>Witch Hunt</em> DLC to provide vital information.
<ul><li> Shale from another DLC, <em>The Stone Prisoner</em>, is technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">Golem</a>, but when introduced she's spent the past thirty years as an immobile statue in a town. Incidentally, she <em>really</em> hates pigeons.
</li></ul></li><li> During the final battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, Meredith brings the statues in the Gallows to life to fight for her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheHunt">In the Hunt</a></em> has a giant statue that chases you up the seabed ruins. Once you manage to damage it enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">using the stone blocks at the top of the screen</a>, part of its face gets ripped off and you see flesh beneath, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">dangling eye sockets</a>...
</li><li> These often guard the homes of wizards in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum">Avernum</a></em> games. A few of them talk to you, but most just hurl lightning bolts at you. Oddly, although they're on plinths and are usually still in combat they prove perfectly capable of sliding around.
</li><li> As seen in the picture, the entire first level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">God of War II</a></em> is an epic battle against the Colossus of Rhodes come to life.
</li><li> Tak, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarGods">War Gods</a>,</em> is a statue brought to life. Since he's not human and lacks blood or internal organs, many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">finishing moves</a> work differently on him. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfBlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfBlackMagic">Pagan's</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Medusa's Head</a>" fatality initially doesn't work on him for obvious reasons. He'll laugh and taunt her until the head shoots him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>.
</li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> campaign, Arkantos has to fight an evil statue of Poseidon. There's also the metal Colossus unit, and Leto's Automatons in the Titans expansion pack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rockman4MinusInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rockman4MinusInfinity">Rockman 4 Minus Infinity</a></em>, statues of Fire Man, Heat Man and Flame Man near the entrance to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> of Pharaoh Man's stage come to life and only use their signature attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> has several. Most dangerous are the Titanite Demons, which the game uses as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">MiniBosses</a>. They are extremely strong and surprisingly quick with lots of jump attacks despite only having one leg. There are also the Stone Guardians, likely protectors of the lost nation of Oolacile. Then there are the demon statues which are the most insignificant of the bunch.
</li><li> As one of the few elements in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> that evoke the originally envisioned pseudo-paranormal angle, there is the Salazar statue, also known as Robo-Salazar. It's located within the castle's cathedral and breaks out to come after Leon when he crosses the bridge. The agent barely makes it to the other side while the statue collapses into the chasm.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ShiningSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ShiningSoul">Shining Soul</a></em> there's a long corridor with statues of playable characters on one side and statues of enemies on the other. Naturally, the statues of enemies come alive and attack you.
</li><li> The Bronze Colossus is the straightest example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, but there's a couple of other creatures that are at least somewhat similar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SmashmuckChampions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SmashmuckChampions">Smashmuck Champions</a></em> has Rook as a playable character. His backstory is that the building period of the Forest Ruins Arena was plagued by mysterious events. The final piece of these was the appearance of a stone statue on the day of the inaugural match. Soon after, light burst forth from the base of the statue, which floated up and introduced itself as a SmashMuck player.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galatea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galatea">Galatea</a></em> has the title statue, which you can hold a conversation with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonumentValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonumentValley">Monument Valley</a></em> has Totem, who can be distinguished from the non-living statues by his distinctive yellow-and-blue coloration; the rest of the statues are various shades of gray.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GemsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GemsOfWar">Gems of War</a></em>, one of the units from Whitehelm is the Archon Statue, an animate statue of an angel-like being with a big sword.
</li><li> Agamo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarOfTheMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarOfTheMonsters">War of the Monsters</a></em> is a statue of an ancient god. It becomes animated when exposed to the alien fuel.
</li><li> The seal guard Renegade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Monolith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Monolith">Monolith</a></em> is one. It looks like a humanoid corpse with bound legs. It only engages in combat when the seal is picked up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime">A Hat in Time</a></em>, there are angel statues in Subcon Forest that are completely harmless, and headless but otherwise identical statues that will chase you down and attack you if you stay in their proximity long enough.
</li><li> Jack the Ripper appears in the Sega platform game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfDarkness">Master of Darkness</a></em>, where he is revealed to be an animated wax doll upon defeat.
</li><li> Among the hidden animals in the <em>Marine Mania</em> expansion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon">Zoo Tycoon</a></em> are mermaids. To obtain them, a mermaid statue needs to be purchased and placed inside an aquarium. It will then break apart to reveal an actual mermaid.
</li><li> Two characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> are living statues.
<ul><li> Aunn Komano from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouTenkuushouHiddenStarInFourSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouTenkuushouHiddenStarInFourSeasons">Touhou Tenkuushou ~ Hidden Star in Four Seasons</a></em> is a komainu statue of the Hakurei Shrine brought to life by a god. That said, she did have some consciousness before the change, because she has memories from back then, including things she saw through the eyes of other statues. As a youkai, Aunn has the ability to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">duplicate of herself</a>, because komainu statues come in pairs.
</li><li> Also from <em>Four Seasons</em> is Narumi Yatadera, a living Jizō statue. Her status as a youkai comes from the influence of the Forest of Magic, going so far as to grant Narumi magical powers of her own. Narumi's snow-covered hat references the folk tale of a poor man donating six hats to six Jizō statues in the cold and being rewarded for his generosity.
</li></ul></li><li> There are two towering statues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</a></em> that serve as (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">new</a>) bosses. The first is the Buddha Statue and the second the Statue of Liberty. They use physical and energy-based attacks in combat.
</li><li> Two bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedEarth">Red Earth</a></em> are living statues.
<ul><li> Ravange from Sangypt started out as a normal (small) sphinx surrounded by other statues in the form of busts and pillar carvings, among which a lion, a dragon, an eagle, and a goat. The sorceress Clara Tantra infused the sphinx with the other four statues and then brought it to life by infusing it with herself. Ravange is a chimera with the heads of the four statues (the lion replaces the sphinx's original human face) and a cobra for a tail, which by process of elimination is Clara herself. This is further made likely by the fact her name is a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a> and Cleopatra is for reasons of dramatization associated with snakes.
</li><li> Gi Gi from Zonama is a South American (although the four arms are more South Asian) guardian statue. It is hinted to be a robot, but if so its outer layer still appears to be stone. It rests on a throne inside a temple, only getting up to attack whomever dares enter.
</li></ul></li><li> Lady Liberty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClayFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClayFighter">Clayfighter 63⅓</a></em> is the Statue of Liberty turned into sapient clay by Dr. Kiln. She immediately had no intention of serving him and joined the battle against him. In her ending, she begins dating the cyborg T-Hoppy.
</li><li> There's a homage to the Weeping Angels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em>. There are some angel statues standing around on the grounds of the church near Lindenvale. Enter and leave again and they'll stalk you by means of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a>.
</li><li> Several living statues try to stop Greendog from taking the treasure from the Caribbean temples in <em>Greendog The Beached Surfer Dude</em>. The first certain living statues are encountered in Mustique. They are birds. In Saba, human-like statues appear. Then there's also several carvings and totems, but whether they are alive or not is unclear. At least the totem composed of multiple heads seems to be alive.
</li><li> Incredibly Ugly Statues are a pair of statues found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IttleDew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IttleDew">Ittle Dew</a></em> depicting, as best as can be described, a troll's head and a donkey-dragon. For the most part they seem regular statues, but one, found in the swamp, does talk. They also appear as card characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CardCityNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CardCityNights">Card City Nights</a> 2</em> along with their counterpart Beautiful Creatures.
</li><li> One of the easiest sanity effects to trigger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> is the bust on the second floor of the Roivas Mansion. At anything less than full sanity, it will stare at Alex wherever she goes. The object cannot be interacted with any other way. The statue also shows up in Paul Luther's chapter, but it doesn't respond to low sanity there. It's not explained how it ended up in the Roivas Mansion.
</li><li> Male busts are among the aggressive NPCs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitchsHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitchsHouse">The Witch's House</a></em>. They menacingly glide after Viola or block her path, and several encounters can end up with one of them stomping her to death.
</li><li> The Relic color variant for pets was introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em> in 2010. It makes the pet look statue-like and even includes a simple pedestal.
</li><li> There's the zombie-like Shakesfear Bust in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters">Moshi Monsters</a></em>. It's purchased at Horrods and when on display rolls its eyes a full 360 degrees.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Handsome Jack</a> calls the player up to taunt them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">how absurdly rich he is</a> by buying a "diamond horse" which he names Butt Stallion in honor of you. He's not exaggerating: the horse is real, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TalesFromTheBorderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TalesFromTheBorderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a></em> you can encounter the actual Butt Stallion (who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa">gone comatose and frozen like an actual statue when Handsome Jack died</a>) and, as a distraction, shoot her. <em>She bleeds</em>.
</li><li> Living statues are enemies in the Old Monastery in ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChildOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChildOfLight">Child of Light</a>. Gargoyles are regular encounters, while the boss fight features two statues of headless angels. The are armed with a trumpet for stabbing, a horn for blow attacks, and their own heads to throw like they're playing dodgeball.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> calls its magically-animated automata <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">golems</a>, but they're really a better fit for this trope, being based off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi's</a> terracotta army. They're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">Powered by a Forsaken Child</a>.
</li><li> Two examples occur in <em>Musya: The Classic Japanese Tale of Horror</em>. Firstly, the boss of the catacombs are the Saru-Ishi (Monkey Stones). In the English version, they enter with a rumble while in the Japanese version, their arrival is announced by laughter. Only one true Saru-Ishi is fought, which starts out blue and later in the battle becomes red and more aggressive. This version is the only one fought in the English version, while in the Japanese version the statue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack">can create up to three copies</a>. The statue and its copies fight by stomping down on Imoto. The other example are the Jizō statues encountered in the next level, the Palace of Hate. They also fight by hopping and stomping.
</li><li> One of the combatants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarGods">War Gods</a></em> is Tak, a stone idol from South or Middle America from millennia ago. His people worshipped The Ore and were declared war on for it by a another nation. The king hid The Ore inside the stone idol and its life-giving properties brought about Tak. Tak participates in the tournament as the avenger of a lost civilization.
</li><li> Two large statues come to life for the boss fight of the tomb stage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSeal">Wizard Fire</a></em>. This is done by two of Volov's prime henchmen, who possess the statues.
</li><li> In <em>Youkai Douchuuki</em>, Jizō statues are an advanced enemy. They start off as small statues, but when Tarosuke they grow to twice his size and attack. Upon defeat, they either go up in smoke or return to statue format and then go up in smoke. Which of the two happens depends on the game version.
</li><li> A six-armed statue is the first boss of the Treasure Island level of the NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainSilver">Captain Silver</a></em>. It floats above Jim and generates energy ammo to shoot at Jim with its middle arm set. It can only be harmed when it comes down to take a swing at Jim, which it indicates it's about to do by stretching out its arms in the relevant direction.
</li><li> There are two examples in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JewelMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JewelMaster">Jewel Master</a></em>:
<ul><li> The boss of the first area is a statue of a white tiger that comes to life. It jumps more than it attacks.
</li><li> Before facing Jardine the Mad, the Jewel Master has to prove his mastery of the elements by defeating four statues charged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>. Each of the statues looks normal until approached, at which point they become the associated element's color. The first encountered is fire, the second water, the third earth, and the fourth wind.
</li></ul></li><li> The construction levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PartTimeUFO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PartTimeUFO">Part Time UFO</a></em> are about helping a group of statues acting as foremen. They're located in places where Greco-Roman ruins are usually found, and their job is to make buildings out of them without breaking anything.

<ul><li> Long ago in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TheFountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TheFountain">The Fountain</a></em>, Areanna fell in love with a dying leper, Luca. On her parents' insistence and Luca's advice, she married another, but he abused her until she drowned herself in the sea. Her parents had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemorialStatue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemorialStatue">Memorial Statue</a> built and Areanna's spirit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">concerned that she had disappointed Luca</a> by taking the path of least resistance, came to inhabit it and influenced the statue to look sad. She was also capable of talking if addressed by her name, but otherwise couldn't move. In modern-day, she met Ethan, who came to the conclusion that the pigeons that always were perched on Areanna's statue were the descendents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomelessPigeonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomelessPigeonPerson">Luca's pigeons</a> and his message to her that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">he just wanted her to be happy</a>. The statue then turns lifeless as Areanna's spirit leaves the stone, locking it with a happier countenance.

From the vandalism to the restoration, Bart hears the statue talk to him. Whether this is in his head or real is left ambiguous.
</li><li> The Lard Lad mascot statue has come to life twice, the first time being in "Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores". Springfield is at the mercy of living mascot statues and billboard images when an odd storm strikes them with lightning. Lisa asks the ad agency that made the statues and billboards for help and they surmise that, like all commercials, the creatures derive power from being paid attention to. The citizens of Springfield are told to ignore them and the statues and billboards promptly collapse lifelessly.
</li><li> The second time the Lard Lad mascot statue came to life was in the intro sequence of "Treehouse of Horror XXIV". As before, the cause is lightning and his cause is destruction. But then he and his donut get eaten by a monstrous Chief Wiggum.

Stan acquired the lot years ago from a garage sale, unaware that they were sapient. They brought in good money and at night could roam around in peace, so everything was well. Then people stopped coming and Stan boarded the wax figures up. The collection was rediscovered in "Headhunters" by Soos and the exhibit reopened, but at night the vengeful figures set out to murder Stan. Dipper and Mabel destroyed them with sunlight and fire, although Larry King's head escaped.

<ul><li> The Opal Starfire Gem is recovered in "Through the City Darkly". It is capable of granting life to inanimate objects. Jana and Jason first get their hands on it at an ice rink and use it to animate the ice sculptures flanking the rink to fight the Guardians. These sculptures depict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent">gryphons</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull">minotaurs</a>. When Tenko takes the gem from Jana, she has the ice sculptures attack her and Jason.

Its role as key seems to be because the emerald is in direct contact with the being and therefore can channel its power. Powell, a human who seeks to free the being, uses the emerald to bring to life five gladiator statues to delay Tenko, aware they wouldn't be enough to actually top her.

Oddly enough a STATUE of the Joseph appears in his room. Zeke figures he can enter this statue and he will win for sure. But he soon finds out that the statue is not just lifelike; it is alive! The Joseph (who insists that his new pals Zeke and Jay call him "Joey") really likes being alive, the food, the flowers, the girls  he is one happy former piazza dweller. It takes all the energy of Zeke and Jay to try to keep Joey from being discovered as he thumps around the house and town, savoring life.

The job isn't without risks: standing perfectly still for prolonged periods is not good for the circulation, and combined with heat and dehydration from a long day's performance, there's a <em>very</em> high risk of passing out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmandaPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmandaPalmer">Amanda Palmer</a> worked as one of these in Boston under the name "The Living Bride", a fact she refers to on the Dresden Dolls song "Perfect Fit."
</li><li> A variant is a living Wax Museum piece. Since the sculpture is more life like than a stone statue, it requires only an appropriate costume to pull off and avoids the heat issues as Wax Museums are often colder due to the constant use of AC to keep the figures from melting.
</li><li> The talking statues of Rome are six statues citizens secretly leave political and religious commentary on in the form of notes as if these are the statues' opinions (thus shielding the actual poster from persecution). This practice goes back to the start of the 16th Century and commenced with Pasquino.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53nft');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note53nft" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53nft');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The English word "pasquinade", a satirical protest in poetry, is derived from the statue's name.</span> Guards were assigned to the statue to prevent notes being added, but this only caused more statues to be used as political bulletin boards. Those statues are Marforio, Madama Lucrezia, Abbot Luigi, Il Babuino, and Il Facchino, and together with Pasquino they are known as the Congregation of Wits.
