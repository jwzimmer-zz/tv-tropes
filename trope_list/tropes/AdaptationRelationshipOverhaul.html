<p>Sometimes adaptations change the way characters feel towards one another. Maybe they're not as close in the source or maybe they're made into enemies in the adaptation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">Promoted to Love Interest</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> typically affect how the characters act towards each other, as do being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> and being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red and Blue are shown to have met at age ten. Their game counterparts are long-term friends turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rivals</a>. They still become friends but the tension of "friend turned enemy" is gone, with instead them just being enemies before becoming friends.
</li><li> Shauna, X, Y, Trevor, and Tierno are all childhood friends while their game versions only met recently.
</li><li> Sabrina, Koga, and Lt. Surge are originally all close enough Team Rocket members. In the games they are unaffiliated with Team Rocket and don't know each other more than they know any other gym leader.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> your rival is your childhood friend and next-door neighbor; your fathers are even childhood friends. In the anime, the game's rival's role of Dawn's childhood friend was instead given to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> named Kenny. Barry would be introduced into the anime later, but Barry and Dawn wouldn't know each other personally (but they have a mutual friend in Kenny).
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>, Cheren and Bianca are close friends of yours who receive their starters at the same time as the player character. In the anime, Bianca was introduced early on and is a friend of Ash and his traveling companions. Cheren meanwhile appears much later in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> incarnation, where he's a new gym leader. The anime's version of Cheren and Bianca never meet and don't know each other at all.
</li><li> <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> anime:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, Island Trials were overseen by trial captains. In the anime, they're run by the Island Kahunas themselves. The jobs of trial captains effectively don't exist. Instead, four out of the seven trial captains are now Ash's classmates and are close friends. The other three are effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> but get an appearance here and there.
</li><li> The relationship between Lusamine, Lillie and Gladion. In <em>Sun and Moon</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lusamine is insanely devoted to obtaining the Ultra Beasts so far as to dress Lillie as close as to one of them as possible. Gladion ended up running off in defiance and it would take Lillie her encounters with the player character to openly defy her mother.</span> In the anime, Lusamine is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents">Amazingly Embarrassing Parent</a> who is overly affectionate towards her kids and whose only real crime in the series is not being too attentive to them. This is more on par with her characterization in the <em>Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</em> games, though the anime shows them being much closer than even that.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive">School-Live!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the anime Taromaru <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim">doesn't like Miki much</a>, despite her wishes. In the manga Taroumaru was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneshotCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneshotCharacter">Oneshot Character</a> who never even <em>met</em> Miki. Back when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Megu-nee was alive</span>, before the girls met Miki, they found a puppy who was later found out to have been bit by a zombie and had to be thrown out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's implied Kurumi killed him when he returned to the school after already becoming a zombie</span>.
</li><li> In the anime, one of the reasons Miki joined the School Live Club was because she thought Yuki made living in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> more bareable. This contrasts the original manga, where Miki was annoyed by Yuki's delusions and it took several chapters for them to become mutual friends. In general, Miki in the manga was initially very distant and distrusting of everyone. The anime removed these elements.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> Ukyo and Shampoo had almost no interaction with each other in the manga. Whereas the anime portrayed them as being rivals, for Ranma's affections and as chefs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the main continuity, Precia and Lindy have no relationship with each other (barring the fact that Lindy adopted Precia's daughter Fate) and they only spoke with each other twice while Lindy was trying to place Precia under arrest. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaINNOCENT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaINNOCENT">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha INNOCENT</a></em>, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a> (probably so Fate can be with both of her families).
</li><li> <em>INNOCENTS</em> also turned Momoko into Quint's high school sempai. This also applies to Signum and Tre (or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">Mituki</a>).
</li><li> In <em>Gears of Destiny</em>, the Materials were originally Yuri's guardians, essentially the precursor for the Wolkenritter's relationship with Hayate. When the story was adapted into movie form for <em>Reflection</em> and <em>Detonation</em>, it's instead revealed that they were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her pet cats turned into familiars by Iris</span>. However, both stories end with them having a familial relationship.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationPersonalityChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationPersonalityChange">Adaptation Personality Change</a>, Rei's closest friend is Usagi in the '90s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> anime. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em> she bonds more with Minako.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X1999</a></em>: After being hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> in the movie, Kusanagi becomes mortal enemies with Yuzuriha <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and even kills her without a second thought</span> which is in contrast with the manga and anime where Yuzuriha has a crush on Kusanagi despite being on the opposing side.
</li><li> In the anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, both Goku Black and Future Zamasu genuinely consider each other as "kindred sprits" who work together to achieve their goal of a Zero Mortals plan including fighting together and even speaking in unison with one another. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper">manga</a>, however neither of them are fond of one another due to differing ideals in what they considered power and their partnership is more based on pragmatism than anything else and when overwhelmed, are willing to turn on each other briefly. Case in point is how Future Zamasu react to Black turning down immortality, in the anime, Zamasu accepted his proposal even though he disagreed with it while the manga, Zamasu looks down on Black for it and even calling him out on it when both Goku and Vegeta overwhelmed them.
<ul><li> Unlike the anime where Caulifla shows a special attachment to Kale and treats her like a protegee, Caulifla in the manga doesn't appear to treat her beyond as another member of her gang who she thinks is in need of more training, to the point that she even questions Cabba when he recruits her for the tournament. This is in contrast to the anime where it is Caulifla the one who suggested to bring her in for the tournament.
</li><li> In the original movies where he appeared, Broly obsessively hated Goku, and just the sight of him (or anyone with a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblence">Strong Family Resemblence</a>) could send him into a murderous rage. In <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em>, Broly has never met Goku and treats him like any other enemy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He even befriends Goku by the end of the movie.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FZero">F-Zero Falcon Densetsu</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the games, Zoda is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> of the Arrows. In the anime, He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Ryu's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> instead. Also, Zoda is one of Black Shadow's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Co-Dragons</a> in the anime, while in the game they're individual villains.
</li><li> Captain Falcon and Samurai Goroh are rivals, even it's one-sided on Goroh's part. The rivalry is omitted in the anime.
</li><li> While Antonio Guster is still Gorohs former partner turned vengeful rival like in the games, the anime adds his sister Lisa Brilliant, who is also Gorohs wife. This makes things just as, if not more personal.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard">Cardfight!! Vanguard</a></em> series, Shin is Misaki's uncle. In the 2018 reboot they're cousins instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hanebad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hanebad">Hanebad!</a></em> has a strange example: in the anime, Riko and Nozomi are friends from middle school who meet again after several years during a tournament. In the manga they have no connection, but Nozomi has a connection to <em>Nagisa</em>, Riko's best friend, that doesn't seem to exist in the anime.
</li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidouTenshiAngelicLayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidouTenshiAngelicLayer">Kidou Tenshi Angelic Layer</a></em> switches around the main couples. In the manga's epilogue, Misaki ends up with Kotaro, while Tamayo starts dating Ojiro. In the anime, however, Misaki ends up with Ojiro, while Tamayo gets together with Kotaro. The Anime also adds a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">Icchan and Shuuko</a>, which didn't exist in the Manga.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em>:
<ul><li> Roxy and Jetta hate each other in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">cartoon.</a> In the comics they disliked each other originally but bonded over a mutual interest in boxing, are now best friends, and are even roommates.
</li><li> The Misfits don't mind Clash, their groupie who wants to be in their band, hanging around them as much as they did in the cartoon.
</li><li> The Holograms overall seem to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelatedInTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelatedInTheAdaptation">act more like sisters</a> in the comic. Kimber and Jerrica are the only biologically related ones however Shana and Aja were their foster sisters since childhood. In the cartoons they're all close but the comic portrays them as more familial. Noticeably Kimber and Jerrica actually call Shana and Aja their sisters in the comics.
</li><li> Rio in the cartoon is in love with Jem, despite already having a girlfriend, though thankfully at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Jem is his girlfriend</a>. Rio in the comics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesMySecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesMySecretIdentity">doesn't like Jem at all</a> and thinks she should leave the band. She comes off as a diva to him and she is constantly ditching the other bandmates (since Jerrica can't be in the same room as Jem).
</li><li> Rio and Jerrica are childhood friends in the cartoon and Rio only meets The Misfits once the series starts. In the comics Rio bumps into Jerrica at the start of the series and has worked with The Misfits.
</li><li> Synergy has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">a much bigger role</a> besides just being a supercomputer. She genuinely seems like the girls friend and there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Synergy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">based on</a> Kimber's and Jerrica's deceased mother</span> early on, though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in comic canon she isn't based on Jacque</span>.

</li><li> In the main continuity, Betty and Archie are both romantically interested in each other. Here, Betty reveals that it was all a facade to keep up the illusion of a regular high school girl while she was keeping an eye on Jughead. Archie's romantic interest in her quickly fades away as well, though the two remain friends.

</li><li> The turtles feelings towards April change in each continuity. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">the original films</a> Raph was teased for being attracted to her. In the 2003 show Don had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a>. In the 2012 series Don has a full blown crush and is Casey's romantic rival. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2014">the 2014 film</a> series Mikey has a stalkerish crush on her.
</li><li> In most versions April acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> to the turtles, but in the 2012 series that aspect is mostly removed, likely as a result of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">Age Lift</a> into a teenager within the turtles age group.
</li><li> While April and Casey are usually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, there are exceptions. In the 1987 series, Casey is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> and there is nothing outright romantic between him and April. In the 2012 series, Casey often flirts with April and she sometimes shows signs of reciprocating, but they never officially get together. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesOutOfTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesOutOfTheShadows">sequel to the 2014 film</a> theres a moment where Mikey (incorrectly) suspects they are an item, but thats it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ixet');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ixet" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ixet');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Considering there was originally going to be a third film, it is unknown if their relationship wouldve stayed that way had it been made.</span>
</li><li> Splinter's dynamic with Hamato Yoshi also changes. Originally he's Yoshi's pet rat mutated into a humanlike form. In some versions (such as the 80s cartoon) he simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">is Hamato Yoshi</a> transformed into a rat. In the 2003 series despite being his pet, Splinter views Yoshi as a father figure, even more so when they start communicating through a mystic orb. The turtles likewise respect him as if he were their grandpa. In the IDW comics hes Yoshis reincarnation. In the 2014 films Yoshi doesn't even exist, and they instead view April as their guardian spirit, since she treated them like pets as a child when they were part of her father's science experiment.
</li><li> Splinter and the turtles relationship has evolved over time. In the original comics, Splinter raised and trained them as tools for revenge against the Shredder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">but later comes to care for them as his sons</a>, while in the 1987 cartoon, Splinter trains the turtles for self-defense rather than revenge-killing, but refers to them as his pupils rather than sons. All following incarnations make it clear Splinter and the Turtles see each other as father and sons respectively and that he trained them for self-defense, making the original comics and cartoons portrayal of their dynamic come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> nowadays. This gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em> when the 1987 turtles are surprised to hear the 2003 turtles call Splinter "father".
</li></ul></li><li> In IDW's first universe of <em>Transformers</em> comics, the few hetero relationships between Cybertronians that existed in prior media are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>, in part due to the initial attempt to paint Cybertronians as an asexual race — i.e. only males existed except for Arcee, who became a much different character than the original — that was retconned as all the female Cybertronians existing on far off, forgotten colony worlds.
<ul><li> Optimus Prime and Elita-1's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">Starcrossed Lovers</a> dynamic is gone entirely, and the two don't know each other, and she plays more of an antagonistic role to Cybertron as a whole.
</li><li> Arcee and Springer aren't romantically involved at all, with her most important relationship instead being with Sideswipe.
</li><li> Ironhide and Chromia aren't in a relationship, with the only allusion to it being the usually serious Chromia's flustered insistence that Windblade not tell Ironhide that she talked about him. Later on, he'd be the one to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> arrest her for her crimes</span>, an <em>extreme</em> cry from their wholesome relationship in the G1 cartoon.

<ul><li> Agatha and the Jaegers, of course. While her relationship with them was never bad in canon, here she grew up with them and knows every single one by name.
</li><li> Mamma Gkika ends up raising Agatha as a daughter. This also means that she doesn't meet Adam and Lilith until much later in life, and while she likes them, she doesn't see them as her parents.
</li><li> Agatha goes by "Agatha Heliotrope" because she is supposed to be Van's cousin. They grow up very close.
</li><li> Rather than being Beetle's Ditzy Secretary who he keeps around because of her family, Agatha is his Hypercompetent Sidekick and he doesn't know anything about her. She is able to avert much of the early parts of the comic by "accidentally" sending a message to the Baron about the Hive Engine, meaning Beetle doesn't get a chance to commit treason. Likewise, she has Merlot's (very grudging) respect.
</li><li> Her relationship with Gil starts out much more positive, since they're able to skip the whole "killed someone in front of her and then kidnapped her" thing.
</li><li> Her relationship with Tarvek has both upsides and downsides: Since he never participated in a plot to kidnap her, she doesn't have any major reason to distrust him. On the other hand, since he never helped her escape from some kidnapping, she doesn't have much reason to trust him, either. She gets a much less competent impression of him overall, since he's largely dragged along as Ducky's "souvenir."

<ul><li> The whole premise of the fic begins with Jiraiya and Tsunade becoming Naruto's adoptive parents (with Shizune as his older sister) and raising him since he was a baby, as opposed to meeting him when he's barely reaching puberty.
<ul><li> While all four are biological relatives due to the Senju and Uzumaki being cousin clans, Naruto is a part of the immediate family of Hashirama, Tobirama, and Nawaki because of being Tsunade's adopted son.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of which, Tsunade and Jiraiya are a married couple in this fic.
</li><li> Shizune becomes friends with both Itachi and Shisui very early on in the story, when she never met either of them in canon. With Shisui in particular, their friendship turns to romance and they would later marry.
</li><li> Naruto and Hinata grow up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friends</a>, and they're already dating by the end of Part I.
</li><li> The Hyuga clan as a whole considers Naruto to be the son of a hero and treats him with a great deal of respect due to Tsunade having saved Hinata's mother's life. In canon their view of him was no different than anyone else in the village (prior to his and Hinata's marriage).
</li><li> Iruka never grows closer to Naruto than he does with any of his other students due to Naruto already having an adoptive family.
</li><li> Tsunade and Shizune's feelings for each other are explicitly that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe">a mother and daughter</a> instead of the ambiguous aunt-niece/master-apprentice relationship they had in canon.
</li><li> The only thing Maki has in common with Matsuri, Yukata and Mikoshi is that the four of them are Suna ninjas. In this fic, the former is the latter three's Jonin-sensei.
</li><li> Naruto and Karin attended the Academy together and, while not incredibly close, treat each other as family. In canon they barely interacted at all.
</li><li> Naruto is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friends</a> with the Sand Siblings, having met the three of them when Jiraya took him on a diplomatic mission to Suna in his youth.

</li><li> Ino drops her crush on Sasuke early on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and takes to hate him due to her father being killed by his mother during the Uchiha Insurrection.</span>
</li><li> Kiba and Tamaki met during their years at the academy and develop a rivalry that's dripping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> instead of just meeting and getting together offscreen like in canon.

</li><li> With the exception of Team 10, all of the Genin teams are rearranged.
</li><li> Karin's crush on Sasuke was due to her thinking he was cute on her first day at the academy instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a>. As a result, she loses interest in him during the lead up to the Chunin Exam finals and simply cares for him as a teammate.
</li><li> Naruto and Sasuke develop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry">Friendly Rivalry</a> instead of the volatile relationship they have in canon.
</li><li> Fu never interacted with any of the Konoha 11 in canon aside from when she was brought back as an Edo Tensei zombie to fight Naruto. Here she is friends with most of the Konoha 15 (in particular with Kiba and Tamaki) and ends up dating Shino.
</li><li> On a geopolitical scale, Kirigakure is allied with Konoha and Sunagakure long before the Fourth Ninja War arc thanks to Konoha having aided Mei's rebellion during the Kirigakure Civil War.
</li><li> Tenzo/Yamato in canon had most his interactions with Team 7. While he still keeps a degree of contact with Kakashi, he's not shown interacting notably with Naruto, Sakura or Sai. He also becomes the Jonin-sensei of a team that includes Hinata's younger sister Hanabi, while in canon he never interacted with her.
</li><li> Sai has very few interactions with Naruto, with his character arc instead being spearheaded by Ino.
</li><li> Danzo boasts during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his fight with Shizune and Shisui</span> that he was a student of Mito Uzumaki. The identity of his jonin sensei in canon was never specified.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Toneri</span> is inducted into the Akatsuki and is partnered with Orochimaru. In canon, he doesn't interacted with any of its members as a result of the organization being dissolved and its members, except Orochimaru, being dead by the time of his introduction.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yakumo Kurama</span> was recruited into Root and interacted with Danzo, whom she never interacted with in filler.
</li><li> Due to the combination of Sasuke never defecting to Orochimaru and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kimimaro being cured from his illness</span>, Jugo not only never swore loyalty to him, but also doesn't know him.

In the fic, they don't interact all that much apart from when Katara is training Aang, and she's generally somewhat annoyed with him most of the time. When he disappears just before Sozin's Comet arrives and causes Zuko no end of trouble by sparing Ozai, Aang becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a> to Katara. After getting a kiss from Katara at the end of the series, Aang decides he's not ready for a relationship and gives up on her.
</li><li> Zuko and Mai, primarily their post-series relationship. In canon, they get back together in the last episode, Mai leaves Zuko in <em>The Promise</em>, and they're implied to get back again in <em>Smoke and Shadow.</em> In the fic, Zuko primarily gets back with Katara for the sake of honor, is miserable most of the time, and finally breaks up with her after learning that Mai had been spying on him.
</li><li> Hakoda and his children. In canon, Hakoda does what he can to be a good parent to Katara and Sokka, even if their responsibilities often force them to be halfway across the world from each other. In the fic, he tries his hardest to be a "cool dad," which ranges from benign but somewhat embarrassing attempts to being a good father to actively trying to get Zuko and Katara to break up.

In the abridged series, Suguha is a verbally- and physically-abusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">Little Sister Bully</a> with nothing but disdain for him, while Kazuto hates his sister so much that he nearly commits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction">Murder by Inaction</a> when she starts choking in front of him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TimeAgainSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TimeAgainSeries">Time Again Series</a></em>: In canon (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue">Bakugo's</a> first past), Bakugo's less moral actions were excused or complimented by his teachers and classmates in middle school since he was popular and had a powerful Quirk. This time around, Bakugo could not care less about popularity or his schooling and cares much more about his friendship with Deku. As a result, his relationship with everyone else at his middle school is much worse. He is bullied, many kids think he and Deku are dating and call them homophobic slurs, and the teachers are convinced Bakugo will become a villain. Their relationship is so bad that many express joy when "that villain" tests out and insult him for it.

<ul><li> In canon, Dave detested Beardo due to viewing his sound effects as being immensely annoying. Here, because Beardo is not eliminated first and eventually starts talking, Dave instead becomes one of his best friends on the show.
</li><li> Like in canon, Duncan and Gwen break up in <em>All-Stars</em>. But whereas that occurred in canon because of Gwen becoming fed up with how Duncan was clearly still interested in Courtney, Gwen here was instead feeling incredibly guilty about the fact the relationship began with an act of infidelity and becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">Amicable Exes</a> with Duncan afterwards.

<ul><li> Alejandro's vendetta against Bridgette. In canon, he targeted her for elimination purely for the sake of getting further in the competition and was otherwise indifferent to her. Here, his failure to eliminate Bridgette in the Yukon makes him increasingly hateful of her (like calling her a shallow bimbo) and her successes, culminating in him staging an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> of her and later trying to outright kill her in the finale.
</li><li> Similarly, Alejandro cared very little about Cody in canon and only started taking him seriously once the two were in the final four. Here, Alejandro considers Cody to be one of his most formidable enemies and makes it a high priority to get him eliminated early so he can then take Bridgette down without any opposition.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NoahTheSchemer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NoahTheSchemer">Noah The Schemer</a></em>: In the show, Duncan and Cody repeatedly conflict with each other due to Cody being jealous that Duncan got together with Gwen, and Duncan being annoyed with Cody's pranks towards him. Here, while Cody is clearly upset that he lost another chance at Gwen, he doesn't hold any grudges against Duncan for it, and even considered allying with him against Courtney.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PredatorAndPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PredatorAndPrey">Predator and Prey</a></em>: In canon, Alejandro was never implied to have any real interest in Bridgette except as someone to manipulate. Here, Alejandro has a sexual predator-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush">Villainous Crush</a> on Bridgette and wants to take her away from Geoff for himself.

<ul><li> In All-Stars, Duncan and Gwen's relationship has clearly lost it's spark, and ending with Gwen breaking up with Duncan when it's apparent that he's obsessed with getting Courtney's attention. Here, while they face occasional road bumps, their relationship holds strong.
</li><li> Gwen and Courtney's friendship also ends differently than in canon. In All-Stars, Courtney betrayed Gwen, intending to have her eliminated second to last despite promising they'd go to the finale together. This ends with Gwen breaking their friendship, and despite Courtney's efforts to restore it, they part on bad terms. Here, despite the events from canon being the same, Gwen and Courtney eventually rekindle their friendship again.
</li><li> In the show, Duncan and Noah rarely interacted, and when they did, it was always negative. Here, their relationship is closer to that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>, the two mocking each other and often engaging in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkToSnarkCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkToSnarkCombat">Snark-to-Snark Combat</a>, but still enjoy each other's company.

<ul><li> Cody and Gwen are an interesting case. In canon, Cody had a big crush on her and spent his time on Total Drama trying to impress her, while she was cold to him. He got the hint that she was not interested in him, and set her up with their mutual friend Trent, causing her to warm up to Cody and them becoming friends. In this story, Cody never pursue Gwen, already aware that it would be useless, but Gwen is cold to Cody despite him never giving her any reason to distrust her. In fact, she's much meaner here than she was in canon. Even when Cody set her up with Trent, she still can't tell Trent what Cody supposedly did to anger her, and, despite her promising Trent to give Cody a chance, she remains cold to Cody and ungrateful to him. Chapter 22 revealed Gwen had a deep hatred of geeks and was never going to give Cody a chance unlike in canon.
</li><li> Unlike canon, Lindsay and Tyler don't start a romantic relationship, with Lindsay gently telling Tyler that she likes Cody already. They still stay good friends afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TotalDramaRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TotalDramaRedemption">Total Drama Redemption</a></em>: In canon, Noah and Gwen had very little interaction, and neither seemed to have a particularly high opinion of the other. Here, Gwen considers Noah one of her best male friends on the show, and ends up in a relationship with him after breaking up with Trent.

<ul><li> In World Tour, Cody and Heather formed a small friendship, while here, it lead to a relationship.
</li><li> In canon Duncan and Gwen broke apart because it's implied the spark between them died, with them lacking chemistry and affection at the start of All-Stars and finally breaking up. Here, their relationship has continued, and has become highly destructive, toxic, and abusive.
</li><li> Jasmine and Samey were friends much early in their lives, and that friendship lead to a secret relationship.
</li><li> In canon Dawn and Zoey were acquaintances. And while Zoey didn't dislike Dawn she did consider her creepy. In this story they are roommates and close friends.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>: Tony Stark / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> and Bruce Banner / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> become friends in the film. Not only are they both experts in science, Tony recognizes something of himself in Bruce, in that they're both men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a> that could use their terrible powers for good. In the comics, the two aren't friends, and Stark was even one of the men that exiled Bruce from Earth in the prelude to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlanetHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlanetHulk">Planet Hulk</a></em>, and Tony's "science pal" is usually Reed Richards.
</li><li> In the comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PepperPotts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PepperPotts">Pepper Potts</a> and Happy Hogan are married; in the MCU, Pepper becomes Tony Starks love interest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to Jon Favreau, Happys actor</a>, Happy is still in love with Pepper, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">she doesnt reciprocate</a>. Later, Happy is given another romantic interest in, of all characters, Spider-Mans Aunt May.
</li><li> The Asgardians, already overhauled and remixed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, are altered even further in the MCU. Heimdall and Lady Sif are not siblings, Hela is Odins daughter instead of Lokis, Frigga is Thors biological mother rather than step-mother, and Donald Blake and Thor are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter">two different people</a>, the former being Jane Fosters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">unseen</a> ex-boyfriend.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MariaHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MariaHill">Maria Hill</a> is Nick Fury's successor as director of SHIELD and a decided foil, with what little interaction they have being frosty at best. In the movies, she's his loyal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent13">Agent 13</a> is one of the Captain's main partners, and his most prominent love interest to boot. The movies divide up these roles and grants them to Black Widow and Peggy Carter, and Sharon ends up as barely an acquaintance as a result.
</li><li> Steve and Bucky's relationship is more akin to a brotherly relationship between equals, whereas the comics had a sense of seniority due to Steve being noticeably older than Bucky (Bucky eventually caught up to Steve's age thanks to aging during his missions as the Winter Soldier) and seeing him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a>, a little brother at best.
</li><li> Bucky and Sam's relationship is much more antagonistic than in the comics, with the two always making jokes at the other's expense and not getting along, and are pretty much only connected through their mutual friendship with Steve. In the comics, the two get along very, very well even outside of both knowing Steve, and don't ever really make fun of the other.
</li><li> The MCU plays up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>s status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a>, and that informs how many other characters interact with him. Tony Stark in particular becomes a mentor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> to Peter Parker, a relationship thats considerably dicier in the comics. As Uncle Ben has already been killed off by the time Spidey is introduced, Iron Man is functionally Peters only father figure in this setting.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> comics, Queen Ramonda is TChallas step mother and Shuri is his half-sister. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther (2018)</a></em>, they are his biological mom and full sister respectively.

In the comics, the two have little to no history with one another, and it's actually Maria's daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MonicaRambeau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MonicaRambeau">Monica</a> who is Carol's ally. This is because Carol's usual best friends, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Spider-Woman</a> (aka Jessica Drew) and Jessica <em>Jones</em>, cannot be used in the film — the film rights of the former belong to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> who runs the MCU, while the latter starred in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">her own series</a>, with her ties to the superhero community <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Tarnsman of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor">Gor</a></em>, the first book in the series, Tarl, a Warrior of the City-State Ko-Ro-Ba and the protagonist, is opposed by Marlenus, the Ubar (king) of the City-State Ar. In the course of the book Tarl kidnaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePresidentsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePresidentsDaughter">Marlenus' daughter</a>. In the film <em>Gor</em> <strong>very</strong> loosely based on the book, Marlenus is the feeble old king of the village Koroba who gets kidnapped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and Tarl rescues him, helped by the King's daughter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent">Maleficent</a></em>, Aurora views Maleficent as her fairy godmother. This is very different both from the fairytale (where the evil fairy is not even named, and only appears two times) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">first Disney adaptation</a>, where Maleficent is the villain.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> movie Mario is several years older than Luigi and is his father figure. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">the games</a> they are fraternal twins.

They do not interact in the book.
</li><li> In the film of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RENT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RENT">RENT</a></em>, Benny is on much less friendly terms with the bohemians, and Maureen and Joanne have a lot less arguments to the point that their relationship is sort of stable and they even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get engaged</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> concerts (and thus The Film of the Concert) are considered an adaptation or official alternate universe to the TV show, and in them everyone gets along really well, which is not something present on the show. That is, except Brittany and Blaine, who have a rivalry that isn't on the show, either. Also of note is that in the concerts Santana is clearly publicly out and dating Brittany, which she wasn't on the show until <em>after</em> the concert film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines">the book</a>, Tom developed a crush on Katherine the moment he met her, although this gradually went away over the course of the story as he and Hester grew closer. Nothing of the sort is even hinted at in the movie.
</li><li> In the books, there's no indication that Pandora Rae a.k.a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pandora Shaw - Hester Shaw's mother</span> and Anna Fang knew each other or had even met. In they were close friends and allies to the point where Anna spent years trying to find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hester</span> after Pandoras death.
</li><li> In the book, Tom and Bevis don't know each other and have no interactions with each other. In the film they appear to be casual acquaintances on first name basis.
</li><li> Katherine and Bevis were love interests to each other in the book, but in the film outside of one significant look when they first meet this isn't alluded to.
</li><li> In the books, Katherine and Thaddeus Valentine were very close with one another, with Katherine describing Thaddeus as more like a best-friend than a father and is unwilling to believe that he could be involved with the MEDUSA plot until 2/3rds of the way through the novel. In turn Katherine functions as Thaddeus' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a> to the point where her calling him out on his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Magnus Crome's plan to destroy Batmunhk Gompa and kill innocent people</span> causes him to develop doubts about whether he's really doing the right thing. In the film this closeness is absent due to the two of them have only a few scenes together, with Katherine being immediately suspicious of her father the moment it seems hes withholding information from her and near the climax Thaddeus only seems briefly swayed by her words before he chooses to ignore them and continue with his plan.
</li></ul></li><li> The live-action Netflix <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017">Death Note (2017)</a></em> movie centers around a Light who's lower on the social totem pole and not nearly so coolly in-control.
<ul><li> Ryuk, the shinigami who dropped the Death Note, openly encourages Light to use it (even downplaying the consequences of killing someone; he's sure he's dreaming, so what the hell) and goes on to hover with a more personally threatening, scarier presence.
</li><li> The movie's equivalent to Misa Amane, Mia Sutton, appears earlier in the story, and as soon as she gets in on the Death Note, "second Kira" nothing, <em>she</em> takes control of the whole thing — with bloodier results than he had had in mind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Light outmaneuvering her at the end is a turnabout rather than kind of a default.</span>
</li><li> In a scene that's clearly based on dialogue from the source material, L confronts Light with his suspicions about being the mysterious killer known as "Kira". In the manga and anime, L puts him to a series of friendly-seeming mental challenges concerning recent evidence while Light plays along and their repartee turns into a mind-screw of "if I <em>were</em> Kira" hypotheticals. In the American movie, while this version of L tells him he has several different possibilities to explain his long-distance murders, he approaches it with certainty, and he can't quite seem to believe that Light himself is genuinely <em>not</em> in control of the "Kira" incident. Before long, rather than digging at each other with a smile, the two of them are openly antagonistic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">the comics</a> Hellboy had a fairly positive relationship with Professor Bruttenholm. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2019">Hellboy (2019)</a></em>, Hellboy has a strained relationship with him due to believing that he was raised to be Bruttenholm's weapon.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004">Hellboy (2004)</a></em> Bruttenholm is full on Hellboy's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherFigure">Father Figure</a>. While he's had a positive relationship with him in the comics, he dies fairly early on in the series of old age, and doesn't play a large part in the series as a whole. In 2004 his death triggers the final act, and Hellboy is pissed.
</li><li> 2004 also features an overhaul with Liz into a fully romantic couple with Hellboy.
</li></ul></li><li> In Charles Edward Pogue's original draft of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986">The Fly (1986)</a></em>, the lead characters were a scientist and his wife as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFly">the original short story</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1958" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1958">1958 film adaptation</a> thereof. One of the two key changes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg">David Cronenberg</a> made to this script, the other being that the protagonist is able to communicate via speech with others until the very last step of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metamorphosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a>, was to make the leads a scientist and a reporter who meet only at the beginning of the story and fall in love while she covers his development of teleportation technology, a relationship that directly shapes the rest of the plot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em>, Juliet is Butler's niece and not his younger sister, as she was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">the books</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a>: Barry Allen's age lift and lack of experience makes him the most junior member of the Justice League in the films, whereas the comic version is usually just as experienced as the rest of them — Wally West, Barry's successor as the Flash in the comics, is usually somewhat younger than most of the League, but he's never painted as inexperienced like DCAU Barry is, since he started superheroics as a kid.

<ul><li> Sansa and Arya get along better in the show than in the books. Their relationship still isn't really close, but Sansa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">bullying</a> was omitted and Arya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a> tendencies are played for laughs.
</li><li> Tyrion and Shae have a genuine love affair in the show. In the books he's paying her to pretend she loves him but falls for her anyway; book!Shae never reciprocates his feelings.
</li><li> Cersei and Margaery's relationship is much more overtly antagonistic in the series. Not because of Cersei, who hates Margaery as much as she did in the books, but because of Margaery openly insulting and trying to undermine her. In the books Margaery mildly teases her at worse.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">Age Lift</a>, Myrcella and Trystane are full on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>, while in the books their betrothal leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove">Puppy Love</a> at most since they're quite young.

</li><li> Robin Arryn loves Littlefinger, whom he calls "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle">Uncle Petyr</a>". In the books Sweetrobin is terrified of him. It's actually Sansa that Sweetrobin adores, though this is heavily downplayed in the show.
</li><li> Brienne in the show is critical toward and annoyed by Pod, while her book counterpart is more gentle with him. Also, she starts her journey traveling with him at Jaime Lannister's suggestion, while in the books they run into each other while looking for Sansa Stark and she takes him under her wing.
</li><li> Ellaria Sand fights with her sort-of brother-in-law Doran Martell over whether or not to go war, but in the books their relationship is far more amicable. Largely because she's received a substantial personality change; in the books she's no more in favor of war than he is.
</li><li> Davos and Shireen don't get many interactions in the books and are just amiable. The show elevates this to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship">Intergenerational Friendship</a> bordering on a surrogate parent-child relationship.
</li><li> Subverted with Lysa and Sansa. On the show Lysa is kind and motherly to Sansa at first, before her jealousy takes hold and makes her hostile. In the books Lysa behaves coldly toward her from the beginning, but it all ends in the same place.
</li><li> A case involving entire kingdoms: the animosity between the Reach and Dorne due to centuries of war is entirely absent on the show. In the books, this old rivalry was inflamed when Oberyn Martell accidentally crippled Willas Tyrell; even though Willas himself doesn't hold a grudge, the rest of his family do. But since Willas was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>, there's no reason for the Tyrells to hate Oberyn — Loras Tyrell even flirts with him.
</li><li> In the show, Tyrion and Jaime's relationship doesn't go sour after the latter frees the former from the black cells for being falsely accused of committing regicide. This is because Jaime interacts with Tyrion after arriving in King's Landing and remains supportive of him during his trial. Though he has reserves regarding Tyrion killing their father, Jaime still remains in good terms with him. In the books, Jaime admits to Tyrion that he lied about Tysha being a whore under their father's orders and Tyrion, out of spite, tells him that Cersei is cheating on him, which destroys the relationship between them.
</li><li> For that matter, in the show the story about Tyrion's first wife Tysha being a whore hired by Jaime is presumably true, since it's never revealed to be a lie as it was in the books, so it's ambiguous whether she actually loved Tyrion in the show, whereas in the books she did.
</li><li> In the show, Jaime remains infatuated with Cersei throughout the series, and they die in each other's arms. Although he leaves her temporarily to fight with the Stark-Targaryen forces at Winterfell against the Army of the Dead, this is because the whole world is in danger, and he returns to her afterwards despite sleeping with Brienne of Tarth. In the books, Cersei's dubious actions and (especially) her infidelity lead Jaime to cut it off with her, outright burning the letter where she asks him to be her champion in her trial by the Faith. Then he goes off with Brienne on what the latter claims is a mission to rescue Sansa.

</li><li> Marius and Jean Valjean's interactions are more positive too. The novel's Valjean initially hates Marius and wants him to die at the barricade rather than take Cosette from him, but in the musical he almost immediately prays for his life and describes him as "like the son I might have known if God had granted me a son." As for Marius, in the novel he pushes Valjean out of Cosette's life after he learns that Valjean is an ex-convict, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">regret it later</a>, while in the musical it's Valjean who makes the decision to leave and Marius tries unsuccessfully to dissuade him.
</li><li> The novel's Mme. Thénardier is afraid of her husband, always obeys him and would never dream of publicly criticizing him, but the musical's Mme.

Mr. J (here an unstable mental patient who's not yet a criminal mastermind) is the fawning, eager, lovesick minion while Harley is impassive, exploits Joker's feelings for her, and is in charge (although she hints she has some feelings for him, but sees him as childish and wasting his potential). Two different versions of the finale take this in still other directions:
<ul><li> In the "Vigilante" version, Joker will actually be willing to turn her in to the authorities for her own good, even knowing she'll hate him for it.
</li><li> In the "Villain" version, Joker becomes more assertive and earns Harley's admiration, with them becoming more equal parters and a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">Outlaw Couple</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though you soon learn that Joker is willing to work behind her back to mess with Batman, and when the chips are down he even flees the scene, leaving her behind with a half-abashed smile</span>.

For instance:
<ul><li> Walky and Joyce are not only not in a relationship, they actually dislike one another.

</li><li> Amber and Sal first met when the latter held up a convenience store and the former stabbed her in the hand after she'd gotten arrested, thanks to her father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">calling her weak for not trying to stop her</a>. In the <em>Walkyverse</em>, they don't really know each other at all.

In return, Sonic isn't constantly annoyed at her affectionate behavior and is actually more reciprocative, as opposed to running away on instinct at the sight of her.
</li><li> Throughout the <em>Sonic</em> series, the brotherly relationship between Sonic and Tails has been a near-constant element ever since Tails debuted in 1992. However, while still often the two closest characters in <em>Boom</em>, Tails is much more independent and the two seem to possess a lot of mutually exclusive hobbies, leading to relatively less character interaction between the two.
</li><li> Sonic and Knuckles' have a frat-boyesque friendship that gained more and more of a presence on the show as it went on. In the games, Sonic and Knuckles rarely interact one-on-one, with their relationship being frosty at best and downright hostile at worst.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Mystery Incorporated</a></em>, the show starts with Velma and Shaggy already in a relationship. But as the first season progresses, it becomes evident that the two aren't compatible due to Velma's controlling attitude and Shaggy's inconsiderate behavior (not to mention Scooby's incredibly-jealous attitude towards it), and they have a somewhat messy break-up midseason.
</li><li> The <em>Mystery Incorporated</em> Fred and Daphne are also in a relationship, but whereas other entries have them express interest in other people, Fred appears to not be attracted to anyone other than Daphne.
</li><li> <em>Mystery Incorporated</em> also has Scooby and Velma generally not too fond of each other, at least at first, spending much of the show feuding over Shaggy's attention. In previous productions, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooInWheresMyMummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooInWheresMyMummy">Scooby-Doo! in Where's My Mummy?</a></em>, it's all but stated that Velma is Scooby's second best friend after Shaggy.

Bow and Sea Hawk are no longer Adora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">love interests</a> but are just good friends, with Adora even being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> for Sea Hawk and Mermista. Hordak moved away from playing a parental role to Adora to a distant overlord (with the parental role being given to Shadow Weaver instead), while Entrapta went from one of his low-ranking minions in the original series to his lab partner, probably closest friend, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">possibly romantic interest</a> in the reboot. Scorpia wants to be Catra's best friend instead of being Catra's fierce rival.

In the comics, they're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> and stay that way as part of a genuinely healthy relationship, a extreme rarity in the world of comics.

That didn't stick at all, and when Steph returned, their relationship was eventually brought back and retained. In the show, however, they've never even had so much as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>, even when Steph became Spoiler and started working with Tim, there's nothing to indicate their relationship is anything more than professional, and Tim's relationship with Cassie <em>is</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> here.

</li><li> The 2011 <em>Thundercats</em> reboot changed just about all the relationships between all the characters:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats1985">the original</a>, Lion-O and his second-in-command Tygra were, if anything, best friends, showing more concern and fear when the other was in danger than they did for anyone else. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011">the reboot</a>, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelatedinTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelatedinTheAdaptation">adopted brothers</a> but arch rivals with little to no respect for each other. The only thing both pairs have in common is an amusing amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext">subtext</a>.
</li><li> The original had <em>zero</em> romance outside of a few very rare, isolated incidents of flirting between Lion-O and Cheetara, which never turned into anything significant. No one had a love interest, and no one was a love interest, not even among side characters. A major focus of the reboot is a love triangle between Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra, followed by Lion-O falling hard for Pumyra <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(who, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>, turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">Honey Trap</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a>)</span>.

</li><li> The 2011 Panthro, now much older than the young prince, doesn't have nearly as much respect for Lion-O as his 1985 counterpart did.
</li><li> In the original, Grune was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a> whose ghost threatens the team; he was Jaga's close friend when he was alive before he turned evil. In the reboot, since he's still alive at the start of the series and a generation below Jaga, he's made Panthro's closest friend and battle partner instead (prior to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, of course).

</li><li> Harold as a teenager was well-remembered for his friendship with Leshawna and frequent attempts to impress her. In <em>DramaRama</em>, the two obviously lack their romantic interactions, but they are not especially close in any other way, which contrasts how the interactions between Owen and Izzy or Duncan and Courtney in <em>DramaRama</em> allude to their teen counterparts' romances in some way.
</li><li> Duncan had hostile relationships with many of his costars in the original series, such as Harold (whom he loved bullying) and Bridgette (who disliked his mean attitude). However, his <em>DramaRama</em> incarnation gets along much better with the others instead, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> tendencies being toned down.
</li><li> Gwen in the original series developed many friendships and complex relationships with other contestants, but in <em>DramaRama</em>, she's instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> amongst the others for her being recharacterized as a sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>.
