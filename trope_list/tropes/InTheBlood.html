It makes a great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a>, a source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">fraternal conflict</a>, adds drama with an unexpected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">family reunion</a>, and can set up a host of different conflicts and relationships. Just like in real life, a person's ancestry can determine their genes and, to a lesser extent, their personality and even their talents; but in fiction, this extends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">skills</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">superpowers</a>, and even moral alignment.
</p><p>Sometimes even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> and the most valiant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> are at risk of going insane, or over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>, if a parent or grandparent was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainByDefault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainByDefault">Villain by Default</a> or member of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Evil Race</a>. This inevitably leads them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangsty</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">existential crisis</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">comes completely out of left field,</a> since they rarely ever struggled against villainous impulses before this revelation.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The reverse is not always true though. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> with a good family is rarely compelled towards good — though it does inform a possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> later on thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> from their family.
</p><p>The hero's fear in this situation is that their "evil genes" will inevitably doom them to become as evil as their ancestors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>, it's written <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">in the blood</a> — despite the fact that up to the point before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> they had a solid reputation, moral compass, and personality, capable of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> to resist just about any evil supernatural coercion. It might be that heroes are as insecure about their ancestry as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">reputation</a>, but there could be other reasons for a hero to worry about it. If he grew up in a society that places high value on ancestry or considers evil to be hereditary then it would be understandable if he worries.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The inevitable conclusion to all this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">navel gazing</a> is either the character going "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>!" or a friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">slapping some sense into them</a>; if he has been raised in ignorance so that he would not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather">Turn Out Like His Father</a>, it is quite likely to actually work. On the other hand, this can end up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>, in that the angst leads to fear, then hate, then evil, as the character either does a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> or becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a>. For a comparison, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMonster">Reluctant Monster</a> bypasses this nonsense entirely and is simply "themselves", albeit with a healthy heaping of introspection.
</p><p>Now, get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biologist</a> who thinks the same thing, and they'll try and splice together a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clone</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">of the hero</a> using such donors as Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Scra</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">ppy Doo</a>, under the logic that their creation will be <em>"the most powerful and evil creature alive! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Bwahahahaha!"</a></em> Which, of course, should only produce a clone with a penchant for mustaches and Scooby snacks, but invariably is pretty evil.
</p><p>A pretty common twist for heroes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleFosterParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleFosterParents">Muggle Foster Parents</a> is that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">the child</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who has been spirited away and raised like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> in the hopes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpbringingMakesTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpbringingMakesTheHero">Nurture can beat out their inherently evil Nature</a>. Amazingly, sometimes it's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilParentsWantGoodKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilParentsWantGoodKids">Evil Parents Want Good Kids</a>. In extreme cases, this "Nature" can manifest as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">Enemy Within</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a>. Again, this twist can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst">Shower of Angst</a>. For some reason, the parent they get the bad blood from is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather">usually the dad</a>. Another twist is the son of a mighty warrior becoming a mighty warrior themselves, even if they were orphaned as a baby.
</p><p>Sub-trope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for when the Nurture position applies. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarck Was Right</a> for children inheriting non-moral traits that shouldn't even be genetic.

Creates numerous problems if the blood it is in is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Royal Blood</a>. The more light-hearted version is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily">It Runs in the Family</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByOrcs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByOrcs">Raised by Orcs</a>, where someone raised by evil people/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">races</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turns out good</a> due to not actually being related to them. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserSonOfLoserDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserSonOfLoserDad">Loser Son of Loser Dad</a>, where everyone else thinks this will be the case. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">Sibling Yin-Yang</a>, when the same blood give very different results.
</p><p>The inverse trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicLineage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicLineage">Heroic Lineage</a>. It's also an inversion of, but not Mutually Exclusive with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NurtureOverNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NurtureOverNature">Nurture over Nature</a>, in which the person chooses their nurturing over their nature.

<ul><li> The goddess Urd of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah!

Even though she identifies as a goddess and it is her affiliation, people have told her more than once her temperament is closer to demon — or rather, nearly exactly like her mother, which is the same for all intents and purposes. This even though she was only raised by Hild for a few early years, and has been a goddess as long as she can remember. Her power is also in the leagues of her mother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Lelouch vi Britannia has become a rebel trying to overthrow his tyrannical father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">Emperor Charles</a>. However, his methods rely heavily on manipulation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">devious plans</a> ... just like his old man's own actions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also, Charles himself seems to mirror his trope in regards to his twin brother, cult leader V.V. Marianne purposely hid herself from Lelouch and made Nunnally suffer just so they could use Lelouch to draw C.C. out for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a> and create the perfect world where their kids would "live in happiness". Receiving scheming blood from both his parents definitely helps.</span>
<ul><li> Schneizel, too, shows a great deal of manipulation in his behaviour.
</li><li> To summarize, many members of the Britannian royal family are this, one way or another. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not only do Lelouch and Charles have plans that they believe are for the good of the world, and yet (by the end of the series, for Lelouch) have a remarkable disregard for human life, Schneizel, too, believes that what he is doing will stop war, despite the fact that he wants to kill all world leaders and destroy every capital city, and Nunnally goes along with it, intending to use Schneizel's nukes on the two of them, and believing <em>that</em> will stop war, is mostly willing to throw nukes around to do it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, Fakir <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is a descendant of Drosselmeyer. It follows that he has the same story-spinning powers as Drosselmeyer, and this ends up being crucial to the plot.</span>

Nico Olvia separated herself as much as she could from her daughter Robin when she set off to be an illegal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a> to try and keep Robin from being the "child of a criminal." When the Franky Family are trying to convince the Straw Hats to take Franky with them, one of the reasons used is "he's the son of a pirate, anyway." Most recently, when Vice-Admiral Garp tells Ace that he'd wanted him and his brother Luffy to become great Marines, Ace tells Garp that their fathers' blood assured they could <em>never</em> be Marines. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ace himself was hunted by the Marines even before his birth because they wanted to nip the potential danger of his father's continuing bloodline in the bud. Only an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> act by his mother, keeping him in the womb for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongestPregnancyEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongestPregnancyEver">twenty months</a> through sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a>, prevented him from being found.</span>
<ul><li> Averted in Whitebeard's beliefs, though. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Upon being informed that Ace was the son of Gold Roger (a major rival of Whitebeard), the pirate captain didn't care in the least, saying it was an inconsequential detail. During the war with the World Government, he is stabbed by one of his allies, whose crew had previously been wiped out by Roger and felt betrayed upon finding out that they were going to such lengths to save Ace. Whitebeard simply tells him that Ace himself had done nothing to the guy, and that it was ridiculous to blame Ace for his father's actions.</span>
<ul><li> Actually in spite of the rather crazy lineage of Luffy's family (The marine's hero, the most wanted man in the world, The future pirate king), one of the major themes of One Piece (confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>) is that heredity doesn't matter, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">family is who you choose</a>. Of the strawhats, only Usopp grew up with a parent related by blood, and she died when he was quite young. Of Sanji, Zoro, Nami, Chopper and Franky, none had significant blood relative parental figures, Robin only met her mother briefly, We don't know about Brook, and Luffy was raised by his grandfather until he was shipped off to stay with his grandfather's friend. Luffy also rather significantly had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two brothers unrelated by blood</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice">Family of Choice</a> theme becomes much more evident in the Fishman/Mermaid heredity. Either species can give birth to an species each other with no qualms as it just means they must have had some ancestor to inherit it from.
</li></ul></li><li> The World Nobles rely on a heavily deluded take on this trope, as they firmly believe that being descendants of the people who founded the World Government makes them faultless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">gods</a>. In reality, they're really just useless, over-decadent blights on society who take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Aristocrats Are Evil</a> to new lows, freely owning and abusing slaves and unhesitatingly murdering people for such petty things as daring to make eye contact with them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Uchiha Clan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is the embodiment of this trope with the clan founder, Madara, even saying that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revenge is the destiny of each and every Uchiha</span>.
<ul><li> However, there are a few subversions: first off, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi. He is easily one of the strongest Uchiha and possesses many typical Uchiha traits but, by all appearances, he is avoiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">going too far overboard</a> in the pursuit of his revenge</span>, and seems indifferent to the idea of revenge. Instead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itachi</span>'s primary motivation appears to be a weighted utilitarianism, trying to preserve the greatest possible amount of what he values, with slight adjustments made for innocence, as opposed to revenge.
</li><li> Recently, it was revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shisui</span> was also a subversion. This is revealed through flashbacks, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he tries to prevent the coup from occurring, but Danzo being paranoid gets in the way.</span>
</li><li> And now that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Real Madara has appeared in zombie form</span>, he seems to be a fairly equal-opportunity asshole who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">cares more about himself</a> than in getting revenge for anything.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kakashi's long thought dead friend Obito <em>was</em> a subversion. Now he's an example that is <em>horrifically</em> played straight.</span>
</li><li> Chapter 619 reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Uchiha Clan's tendencies of nihilism and self-destructive behavior are <em>literally</em> In The Blood. According to the revived Second Hokage, Uchiha experience love, friendship, and attachment more than any other clan, and are thus affected worse than anyone else at losing someone they care for. The Sharingan and its advanced forms are triggered by a change in brain chemistry caused by these negative emotions... a change that also triggers a shift in thought patterns that more often than not leads the Uchiha in question to nihilism, anguished rage, and madness. The entire Uchiha Clan is cursed by their core genetics to become monsters if they lose someone they love. And given the profession nearly all of them go into, losing a loved one is a near-certainty.</span>

Still very cruel and arrogant, but given he was possibly the most powerful thing on the planet it would be hard not to be.

Hellboy himself is initially dismissive of the idea, but has become increasingly worried that there may be some truth to this. It's also played rather more literally than most examples: in "The Island", a man drains HB's blood and uses it to reanimate himself, and the blood causes the man to transform into the demon Hellboy "should have been". He also steals his crown and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName">name</a>, which Hellboy then uses as a weapon.

Victor's brother Saul is basically Victor but without as much muscle to back him up. Victor's son Graydon despised his parents for abandoning him and became an anti-mutant activist who also had ties to murderous youth gangs.

He constantly ruminates on his father's legacy, wondering why he had turned - ultimately it's the threat to his family that gets him to claim "My father's destiny is my own." The Emperor proceeds to replace his mechanical right hand with a different prosthetic, a "better" one speculated by some fans to be of a model Vader used, and dresses Luke in outfits clearly inspired by his fathers', as can be seen in the page image. Ultimately it's the love of his sister, and his refusal to hurt her or allow her to be killed, that brings Luke back.

Heroine Jame and her twin brother Torisen are of the "royal" house of Knorth, inheriting both powerful abilities and the possibility of insanity; Torisen constantly worries that he carries the Knorth madness and worries he'll become his father.

This also affected his upbringing, but there's a sense a "biological" excuse is seen as necessary.

Drizzt's sister turned evil due to their mother's influence, and Jarlaxle (who isn't even from Drizzt's family!) demonstrates what Drizzt observes as an odd sort of sanity for a drow, despite being a ruthless mercenary. Given Mooshi's comment that the children of evil species often demonstrate "not-so-subtle differences" from good races, a mutation is looking more and more probable, albeit a mutation that's struck more than one family line.

He kills several nursemaids by suckling them to death, then grows up as a naturally horrible person who eventually goes so far as to lead a gang rape of a convent full of nuns whom he then locks up and sets on fire. However, when someone actually tells him that he is the son of the devil, he repents immediately, goes to the Pope for penance, and eventually becomes more or less a saint.
</li><li> Merlin himself is alternately an example and an aversion of this trope. In some medieval texts, he inherits his incubus-father's powers <em>and</em> his evil or amoral nature; in others, he inherits the powers but not the evil, and he receives some powers from God as well.

The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of his own family." Watson calls this "rather fanciful", to which Holmes admits that he doesn't "insist" on it.
<ul><li> Holmes made similar allusions to Moriarty himself. ("A criminal strain ran through his blood...")
</li><li> In another case, Holmes deduced that a nice-seeming man was a closet villain because his young son was cruel to animals. While this isn't an implausible deduction, Holmes attributed the boy's misbehavior to this trope rather than to the trauma of abuse at his father's hands.

<ul><li> All of the descendants of Gwydyr are bad news: Gwydyr arrogates himself to the position of king of the People Across the Lake; later, his descendant, Gedder, uses scheming and murder to gain prominence of Vespugia. Even Gedder's seemingly harmless sister, Zillie will, if she marries Bran, become the ancestor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> Mad Dog Branzillo, who plans to destroy the world in a nuclear war. Later, in the revised timeline, in <em>Troubling A Star</em>, another descendant, Guedder, is the dictator of Vespugia, whose scheming ensnares Vicky.
</li><li> Similarly, anyone with the last name Mortmain is similarly tainted. During Colonial times, Pastor Mortmain and his son Duthbert attempt to railroad Zylle for witchcraft. Later, during Beezie's childhood, a descendant, Duthbert Mortmain (II?) is a competent businessman — who beats his wife and makes passes at his thirteen-year-old stepdaughter. His son inherits his criminality but none of his competence and dies in prison.
</li><li> The Maddoxes, Llawcaes, and O'Keefes are an interesting example. The Maddoxes and Llawcaes are generally good families, but one person's intermarriage, as with Gwen and Gedder or Bran and Zillie, can spoil the entire family tree from that point forward. The O'Keefes are generally a degenerate family, including Jack, who flings homeless puppies to death against the wall of the barn, and Paddy, who schemes with Duthbert the Younger to have Chuck committed. However, when Paddy and Beezie marry, although most of their children take after their father, becoming bullies and thugs, Calvin inherits the Maddox traits and becomes one of the heroes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWrinkleInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWrinkleInTime">A Wrinkle in Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWindInTheDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWindInTheDoor">A Wind in the Door</a></em> Later, all of Calvin's children inherit the good Maddox traits rather than the bad O'Keefe traits.
</li></ul></li><li> A more mundane example of this (and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVersusNurture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVersusNurture">Nature vs. Nurture</a>) is discussed in the poem <em>In the Blood</em>, as it's wondered if the subject had <em>learned</em> to be aggressive and cruel or if she would develop those traits because of her genetics.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> was a big fan of this trope, often referring to families having a "taint" in their bloodline. But as she was one of the first mystery authors to consider the impact of psychology on a person's mind, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">she gets something of a pass</a>. It's also partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that many of her novels feature the British upper class; marriage between relatives (ranging from distant to first/second cousins)in that class was somewhat common to keep the bloodline "pure," and mental instability/illness is a proven side effect of closely-related people marrying and having children, as there's simply not enough genetic diversity to defend against mutation.
</li><li> There are several examples of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em>. Jace thinks he is evil because he is the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Valentine</a>, and because he believes that Valentine has been experimenting with demon blood on him and that it is corrupting him into evil.

<dl><dd><ul><li> As it later turns out that he is not the son of Valentine, and was not even made by him partially demonic, his attitude changes. He is still the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">fanatical demon hunters</a>.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Clary Fairchild is actually the daughter of Valentine. But she also inverts it, because she is not evil at all.
</li><li> But it's playing straight with her brother Jonathan Morgenstern. He is a cruel and sadistic person. The reason for this is not that he is the son of Valentine, but that he was partly a demon due to the experiments with demon blood, and thus was corrupted into evil. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Valentine hoped to create a stronger kind of nephilim, but he was horrified by his demonic leanings</a>.
</li><li> There has been a long history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racist reservations</a> about warlocks who are born between demons and humans. Demons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">always evil</a>, but warlocks are not very different in their morale from humans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Fairies</a> are also considered evil. They are the descendants of angels and demons, and they are said to be as beautiful as angels, but as evil as demons. However, the books also show many benign (or at least neutral) fairies, and even the most vicious fairies are not as evil as demons.

</li></ul></li><li> There's an episode of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> ("Born Bad") where a teenager on trial for murder has his parents put this forward as a legal defense — due to a unique genetic condition, the teen is predisposed to a life of violence, and thus not wholly responsible for his actions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This backfires in the most <em>spectacular</em> way possible, as the teen himself decides to plead guilty after hearing <em>his own defense</em> talk about how he's destined to be a violent criminal.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a>'s</em> Sam Winchester develops psychic powers slightly before the start of the show, which eventually turns out to come from their family's demonic nemesis having <em>fed</em> Sam his own demonic blood in the cradle. Fear about destiny and inevitability increase as more and more of the other children so marked go 'darkside,' or in one case kill their psychotic brother who had, and their father's final words to Dean are that if he can't save Sam, he may have to kill him. Sam resists the original 'destiny' associated with this status by not killing during the demon's little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a>, but the other survivor opens the gate to Hell anyway.
<ul><li> Later, after he developed his powers further by drinking more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">demon blood</a> to exorcise demons so he could prevent the Apocalypse and became addicted, it turned out that he'd been being prepped for years to open a different door<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, the one to Lucifer's cage</span>.
</li><li> This gets treated as In The Blood despite it just being a few drops of ingested liquid rather than actual heredity. Once it turned out their mother Mary sold Azazel the right to take 'something' from her house in ten years, and that in cases where he wasn't interrupted no one was killed or kidnapped, it seemed the demon did in fact have the rights of a parent over the kids he'd bought, and the blood thing was claiming that and preparing them to open the doors and enable the endgame. Presumably, he was only in charge of opening doors, given that Sam was the favorite but not necessary to his understanding of the endgame, and chance or destiny or Lilith arranged the rest.
</li><li> Destiny also grabbed the Winchesters by the veins in that they are apparently descended on both sides from a line of archangel vessels, and were <em>born</em> to house Lucifer and Michael for their final apocalyptic battle on earth. Lucifer says, "It had to be you, Sam. It always had to be you." Presumably, the Campbell line was Lucifer's vessels and the Winchester was Michael's, and the reason they had to bring the two together in John and Mary was that the final vessels needed to be brothers. Lucifer's lack of interest in Adam and Michael's in Mary might point this way, but it's not conclusive. The idea of destiny is thrown about a lot here, but given how hard Heaven and Hell both had to work to make it happen, Destiny may just mean 'the plan.' See also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallKnowsWhereYouLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallKnowsWhereYouLive">The Call Knows Where You Live</a>.
</li><li> There is an in-universe procedure for breeding <em>actual</em> half-demon children. The one who turns up in season five is apparently the Antichrist, a decent little kid named Jesse with enough power to hypothetically threaten the Heavenly Host. The Winchesters talk to him a bit, borrowing help from Spiderman, and the kid becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist">Anti Anti Christ</a> by running away from home and vanishing so he couldn't be used in any war, despite the fact that he could have saved the world from many of its major threats since. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> apparently defied here.
</li><li> In season 10, Cain snaps and goes on a killing spree targeting his descendants, believing that they inherited his murderous taint and that the world would be better off without them. This is especially bad since Cain, being the son of Adam and Eve, is one of the first humans who ever existed. His descendants make up a good chunk of humanity.
</li></ul></li><li> Holling from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure">Northern Exposure</a></em> didn't feel he should ever have children because every Vincoeur from the cruel French aristocrats down to Holling's foul-tempered father had been some sort of sadistic monster. Holling himself was a perfectly sweet and kind person, and didn't seem to fear turning into a jerk himself — but at the same time was convinced that the vileness would carry over to his kids should he ever have any. (In fact, one child of his did turn out to be a money-grubbing con woman.)

But in the end it turns out that they aren't related to the Bosquito at all; it was just evil propaganda.</span>
</li><li> A more realistic version of this was done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, where Chloe is afraid she'll end up like her mother. But it's not evil, it's insanity, which often is genetic. Lex, on the other hand, has evil genes, although the nurture side isn't helping either.
<ul><li> Clark himself believed this of "Luthor blood", until the episode "Luthor" where he discovers that his alternate self, raised by Lionel Luthor, was monstrous as an actual Luthor even without the blood relation. This realization allows him to accept that Tess Mercer, the biological daughter of Lionel Luther, can be trusted to be a subversion of the trope.
<ul><li> Though it is worth nothing that she apparently did inherit Lionel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> ability along with his tendency for pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One of the main sources of dramatic tension in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGothic1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGothic1995">American Gothic (1995)</a></em> is the question of Caleb's parentage — not just whether he really is Buck's son, but whether he can actively resist becoming corrupt and evil just like his father. And it seems he and Merlyn are right to worry, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the more time he spends with Buck, and the more he learns from him, the more cruel, amoral, callous, and sadistic he becomes</span>. This is likely helped along by his near-death experience, Buck's powers, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being possessed by Buck</span> but the simple fact is after ten or so years of showing no signs of evil, once he learns of his (possible) heritage, Caleb's fall into darkness is somehow inevitable.
</li><li> Towards the end of the epic miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Centennial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Centennial">Centennial</a></em>, the evil Wendell clan comes along. Perhaps we can blame them for how the quality of the series really started to deteriorate around that point.

</li><li> Spencer Reid worries a lot about becoming a paranoid schizophrenic- like his mother, as there is a higher chance of it occurring in him if a family member also has had it.

</li><li> "In the Blood" was actually used as the title of an episode. In it, a man with a history of mental problems finds out he's the descendant of William Stoughton, chief justice in the Salem Witch Trials, and begins to imagine himself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">The Witch Hunter</a>; he kills his first two victims using Salem's actual methods, pressing and hanging, before deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a> for his final one.

While some personality influences are obviously present, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond's mothers are slow, careful drivers, and James May's is remarkably aggressive and fast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified">Justified</a></em> does not state this trope but is highly influenced by it.
<ul><li> Raylan shares a lot of character traits with his father Arlo and does not want to be an angry, violent manipulative bastard like him. The show likes to show how much alike the two of them are even though one of them is a good guy and the other a bad guy.
</li><li> This trope is twisted all around with the Crowder family. The patriarch Bo is a brutal career criminal. Boyd is a villain from the beginning but is revealed to operate on very different motives than his father and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">does an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> after Raylan shoots him in the series premiere although it takes a season for the other main characters to believe that he changed.</span> Bo Jr was a star football player and thought to have a great future but ended his life as a wife beating brute whose own family did not feel like avenging.

They've been "fighting the system" for as long as the Duke Clan and corrupt politics have coexisted. In the old west, the Duke's ancestors displayed an affection for fast horses; in modern times, they prefer fast cars. The Dukes' ancestors have also been allied with some other clans as far back as those clans have coexisted; this sometimes leads to Uncle Jesse recruiting the descendants of those clans as modern day allies by reminding them of that fact. Boss Hogg and Rosco's ancestors in the old west were also shown to be corrupt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em> has this with the newer series being a continuation of the old series, and the new Michael Knight being the son of the old Michael Knight. The fact that "Knight" is an alias used after each was supposedly killed also qualifies.
<ul><li> The new KITT and KARR also qualify, having been built by the same man as the originals. They reprise the rolls of their namesakes, with KARR being psychopathic and having killed people before being deactivated and supposedly destroyed (but actually just put into storage).
<ul><li> The new KARR even shares <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCullen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCullen">The voice of his namesake from the origional</a>.

Jules' father is/was a cop and Sam used to be in the military before joining the SRU and his father is a General.

<ul><li> The series also has half-demons. Demons often have offspring with humans because they can inconspicuously reside in human society. For half-demons, the temptations of evil are very strong, but if they really want it, they can be good too, because they have human souls and can feel human emotions.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> This show has a somewhat more realistic example of this: Xander ends up cancelling his wedding because he fears turning out like his parents (his father, especially), who are abusive alcoholics.
</li><li> Implied to be the source of Amy's raw magical power.
</li><li> In <em>Angel &amp; Faith</em>, Faith's own father tells her that, no matter how much she tries to change or how much she tries to be one of the good guys, she will <em>always</em> be in trouble simply because she is a Lehane, which drives Faith into a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Groosalugg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> also inverts it. He is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid">demon with human ancestors</a>, and because of atavism he almost looks like a human being. And although most demons in his society are evil, he is really good.
<ul><li> Later it turns out that many half-demons invert it. Half-demons are more likely to choose goodness than evil, and the evil half-demons have almost always been motivated by human motives, making it questionable whether their demonic origins made them evil.
</li><li> Not only half-demons, even pure demons are by no means always evil. Many demons in the series are more neutral than evil, and some are even good. Lorne is not only a good demon, but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">more moral</a> than most humans seen in the series.

Then Joe, the family friend who once owned the family restaurant with their late father, shows up. Bailey at first thinks Joe is going to talk about how disappointed Bailey's father would be if he were still alive, but Joe reveals he would say instead, "Not you, too." Bailey thinks this is just another ploy, until he sees how shocked Charlie, Julia and especially Claudia are at the news.

<ul><li> Just try to find a second- or third-generation wrestler whose gimmick <em>doesn't</em> center around wrestling being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a>, face or heel. Probably the best example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, a third-generation wrestler who believes that his lineage automatically makes him the greatest wrestler ever (never mind that dad, grandpa, and uncle Barry were all midcarders at best...). Orton went on to found a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">Power Stable</a> called Legacy, where the biggest entrance requirement was that you must be at least a second-generation wrestler. Their motto? "Born better."
<ul><li> The Rock's first gimmick in the-then WWF was of Rocky Maivia, the name being a combination of his father, Rocky Johnson's name and his grandfather Peter Maivia's surname. Initially, he was pushed as a face but people hated him. After he joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNationOfDomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNationOfDomination">The Nation of Domination</a> and later became The Rock, he became one of the most popular wrestlers of all time, so popular that he was able to retire from wrestling and has had a successful movie career. His ancestry has paled in comparison to his success.
<ul><li> Though he <em>is</em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> bloodline of the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty, which is a vastly sprawling family of Samoan-Americans known for their professional wrestling careers. This is actually a subversion, though, as many Anoa'i wrestlers rarely bring up their connections to the greater family (usually it's the commentators who discuss the heritages that they're descended from).
</li></ul></li><li> Though not directly descended from a professional wrestler, Rey Misterio started off as Rey Misterio Jr. He is a second-generation wrestler as his uncle (Rey Misterio Sr.) was a successful luchador. This is rarely brought up other than mentioning that Rey is a Mexican icon.
</li></ul></li><li> This example is a little more successful in Mexican Wrestling, where second generation wrestlers like Hijo del Santo and Perro Aguayo Jr. are huge idols in their own right. They do play this trope straight, with Santo always trying to be the "hero" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto">his father was</a> and Perro Aguayo having many of the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">storylines as his father</a>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG">Dino Attack RPG</a></em>, this was the primary reason behind Rev Raptor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide">Heroic Suicide</a> just after defeating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> father, Dr. Jecht "Landro" Raptor, in battle. Landro told Rev that it was in his destiny to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">follow in his footsteps</a>, and Rev was so afraid of the possibility that, rather than risk letting it come true, he was willing to die to prevent it from happening.

Half-demons suffer from this even more so as their demonic side often tries to goad them to act on impulse and self-gratification. The descendants of the infamous warlord Sydney Losstarot also have to live under the shadow of their ancestor, and every Losstarot is feared more or less.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Used extensively in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. The God-Emperor of Man created the twenty Primarchs, and when each wound up being raised on an alien planet by whoever happened to stumble across them, each become an immensely skilled warrior, and most of them ruled a planet or ten. The modern-day Space Marines are all genetically modified with gene-seed based on one of the Primarchs, and all exhibit behavior similar to that Primarch — the Blood Angels and their descendants, for example, all tend to be pious, noble, and prone to turning into bloodthirsty kamikaze maniacs intent on ripping the enemy limb from limb and drinking their blood.
<ul><li> The Tyranid genestealers use this trope as their means of infiltrating other races. They implant their victims with Tyranid genetic material which subverts the genes of the victims. The victim's children are born as hybrids and become genestealer cultists by default.
</li><li> The Space Marines, however, are subjected to extreme hypnosis and mild brainwashing at the same time as they receive the gene-seed. This is mostly to make sure all their implants work, but the result is that they end up more like their Primarchs than when they started — and they were selected in the first place due to their similarity.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted as well. The God Emperor was possibly the most powerful psyker to ever live, supposedly because he was the result of an entire generation of ancient psykers sacrificing themselves to become one combined soul. Out of all of the Primarchs, Magnus the Red, Sanguinius, Konrad Curze, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Lorgar</span> were the only psykers. And only Magnus developed and trained his psyker abilities. The Primarchs' appearances were also radically different from each other: Magnus in particular was a red-skinned cyclops (though later editions claim that Magnus lost the eye as part of his deal with Tzeentch rather being born a cyclops).
</li></ul></li><li> The descendants of extra-planar creatures in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> tend towards the alignments of their forebears. Thus, half-celestials and half-fiends are almost guaranteed to be good and evil. <em>Their</em> descendants, aasimar/deva and tieflings, are also predisposed (though not guaranteed) to maintain their ancestors' alignment.
<ul><li> Half-orcs, no matter how civilized their upbringing, favor the barbarian class (especially in 3rd Edition), apparently inheriting the Orc's wild nature.

</li><li> Played with in the race of tieflings, who are the descendant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">humans and devils</a>. The race itself is actually an <em>aversion</em> in that despite being descended from devils, tieflings are no more predisposed toward good or evil than their human cousins. But many people <em>believe</em> they are and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">treat them accordingly</a>. Ironically, this does lead some to embrace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">their heritage</a>, which then reinforces their evil reputation. Nonetheless, there are heroic tieflings who try and convince people that the tieflings are not evil by nature and many more who simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">try and keep their heads down</a>.
</li><li> Half-drow are hated and avoided by other people because they are related to the drow. In addition, they have a great similarity with them on the outside. Most people can not distinguish a half-drow from a drow. However, half-drow more quickly recognize the lies in the doctrine of Lolth, and can better resist the evil than pure drow. Although there are still many wicked half-drow, most of them go to the surface to become an adventurer, and, to prove others, that they are not like the drow.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> is at least <em>slightly</em> subverted however because "Always" doesn't actually mean "<em>Always</em>". Even a demon, who has pure Evil as part of their very substance, has a non-zero chance of not actually being evil. We're talking maybe 1% who are Neutral, and 0.1% who are good, but it <em>does</em> explicitly happen (though they are still made of Evil, and can be affected as such by spells). This has led to endless debate among players over whether or not this makes beings who the books say are "always evil" okay to kill on sight, even with the slight chance that they don't live up to their stat-blocks.
<ul><li> The Book of Exalted Deeds (a handbook for being Good) says that killing them is wrong, but also points out that if the DM pulls a bait-and-switch too often by having monsters the players have been merciful to betray them, its understandable that they will be upset and less trusting in the future.

Desmond, with multiple Assassin lineages behind him (including Edward) had to go through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to express it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Blazing Sword</a></em> we have minor villain Erik, son of the corrupt Marquess Darin. In the next game in the continuity, Erik has grown up to be exact same tyrannical ruler his father was, and repeats his predecessors' mistakes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">step by step</a>, even going so far as to kidnap a little girl (for different reasons, but still). This is bothersome as Darin wasn't truly evil until he met Ephidel and Erik seemed repentant after being defeated by Eliwood and Hector.
</li><li> Very subtle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em>, but present nonetheless: One of the most amoral members of the Greil Mercenaries turned out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the son of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> from the previous game.</span> Possibly averted in that despite being amoral, he is also fiercely loyal (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">ahem</a>) to Ike, and for lack of a conscience of his own, he often follows Ike's.
</li></ul></li><li> Gotha's family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV">Dragon Quest V</a></em> starts from a masculine Pankraz, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">a son</a> who has as much masculinity as him when he grows up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">suffers very similar fates as him when he's married.</a> While this guy's not as strong as his father, he has an ability to use healing spells, which carries onto his son, who can even cast a better multi healing and revival spells while still being a hard hitter. Also in the game he wonders if he can catch and train monsters like his daddy does.
</li><li> This is why the Medic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>; this whole family is full of them, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nox">Nox</a></em>, the world of Nox's Legendary Hero wipes out every member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> Necromancers, but spares the last Necromancer, a mere baby, sending her off to be raised by the primitive but morally neutral Trolls without any knowledge of her true heritage. She grows up to be the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and inherits not only her ancestors' total evil, but also their raging Goth-ness. (Although the Wizard ending implies she was possessed by the evil spirits of all her evil ancestors, and without being indwelt by them she's actually a pretty decent lady).
</li><li> Likewise, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivineDivinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivineDivinity">Divine Divinity</a></em> series, the Hero spares <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntichrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntichrist">The Antichrist</a> because he's just a little baby, and tries to raise him as his own son and a champion of truth and justice. This <em>does not</em> work out, at all (although the failure was at least in part caused by external factors, namely the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a> sending an agent to tempt him to the Dark Side).
</li><li> The priestess character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuelSaviorDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuelSaviorDestiny">Duel Savior Destiny</a></em> has an exhibitionist kleptomaniac split personality called Black Papillon, which claims that it exists because of a combination of stress and because all her family were thieves. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, it turns out she was adopted, making this rather dubious.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></em>'s two protagonists Alex and David Mason are father and son. You see David as a young boy in a flashback to the mid-1980s when his father is called back to the military to save an old friend and then by the year 2025, he's serving as the Lt. Commander for SEAL Team Six.
</li><li> Even in the good ending, something sinister happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadFather">Mad Father</a></em>. Despite getting away from her homicidal father, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aya takes after him in the future. She runs a clinic in the middle of the forest and turns unsuspecting innocent women and teenagers into dolls with Maria by her side. One of the reasons her father wanted to make her into a doll was to keep her from turning out like him when he discovered that she was mutilating small animals like he did in his youth. Her mother was arguably even crazier, since she <em>admired</em> her husband's madness and was happy that Aya was following in his footsteps.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> has the Emmerich family, who is all but cursed to be tied to nuclear weapons. Hal "Otacon" Emmerich was tricked into developing the Metal Gear REX under the pretense that it was made for intercepting and destroying nukes, when it was actually built to <em>launch</em> nukes. His father, Huey, was born on August 6, 1945: the exact same day as the bombing of Hiroshima. Huey was also involved in the development of the Metal Gear ZEKE and Metal Gear <em>Sahalanthropus</em>. Meanwhile, Otacon's grandfather was one of the scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the aforementioned bombing of Hiroshima.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em>. After discovering his relationship to the series' previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Jake becomes moody and snappish, certain that he's destined to follow in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">father's footsteps.</a> There's some evidence to support it; Jake has an incredibly similar fighting style to his father, instinctively seeks out combat, doesn't really believe in anything bigger than himself, and even inherited Wesker's viral immunity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end it's subverted; despite his affinities, Jake ultimately uses them to pursue a completely different path.</span>
</li><li> This is how Heroic ability is passed down in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> series. The main series focuses on members of a particular bloodline who all have Heroic ability off the charts.
</li><li> One of the biggest spoilers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yandereness runs in the Aishi family. Yandere-chan's mother Ryoba murdered a rival and kidnapped her senpai, who becomes Yandere-chan's father. The Basement Tapes hint that Ryoba's mother did the same, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says this goes back many generations.</span> Whether this continues or is averted is ultimately up to the player.

Jobe is a ruthless, amoral genius bio-devisor who even looks like his supervillain dad; his dad hates that junior doesn't have a flair for mechanical devises instead.

It's worth noting that membership in the Bad Seeds does not in itself infer an intention to become a supervillain (some do, some don't, and the setting makes plain that either is no more likely than any other high school career ambition) they're just more-or-less stuck together for mutual protection because everyone else fears that evil <em>is</em> in their blood.

<ul><li> Azula also shares this trope with her brother, but adopts the more merciless (I.E. Azulon and Ozai) traits of the previous Fire Lords. Whereas Zuko's banishment from the Fire Nation led him to grow and develop and learn more of the world beyond the Fire Nation, Azula pretty much absorbed all of the propaganda from the past, lies and all and is essentially the fourth generation of the Fire Nation's toxic mentality and bloody history. By "Smoke and Shadow", one can see a theme between past and future changes for the Fire Nation between them: With Zuko representing the change for the Fire Nation whereas Azula wants it to stay the same as it was during Sozin's, Azulon's and Ozai's reigns. However, it's worth noting a potential underlying of fear of change in her as well; as it seems like Azula had never fathomed a different path the world would take.

<ul><li> Psychological research shows that a lot of our personality traits are partly inherited from our relatives. For example, a child born from parents with deficient levels of Monoamine oxidase A (a neurotransmitter that helps to control aggression and impulsivity) is likely to be more aggressive than a child with normal levels of the "warrior gene". However environmental factors are just as likely to inhibit those chances they will be exhibited in behavior if the child was born in a supportive household rather than an abusive one, the latter which makes the likelihood of them exhibiting aggression 10 times more likely.
<ul><li> The factors of environment on actually <em>changing</em> bloodlines is the basis of a field of study called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics">epigenetics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Twins with similar diets and lifestyle turned out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned">exactly as planned</a> (so to speak), while those who were separated at birth would have some similarities due to genetics but other traits would change or form differently due to lifestyle, including appearance.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200809/the-50-0-50-rule-why-parenting-has-virtually-no-effect-chi">The latest thinking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the 50-0-50 rule. In terms of Genetics/Parenting/Environment, Parenting doesn't matter... sort of. The reason you and your siblings turn out so different despite having the same parents is that everything about your parents is already accounted for in either genetics (the ways you're alike) or environment (the ways you're different).
</li></ul></li><li> This is a common subject of debate concerning "dangerous" dog breeds such as pitbulls.
</li><li> Recent research indicates that some animals have a so-called "domestication gene," and some do not. It's the reason why horses have been domesticated for thousands of years, but zebras have not despite efforts and despite their otherwise being closely related. Interestingly, foxes that are bred to select for the domestication gene not only become more docile and friendly to humans, they also begin to take on physical characteristics and behaviors of domesticated dogs, such as tail-wagging when happy.
<ul><li> It's the other way round. Animals that are selected for domestic traits (eg being less fearful of humans, or less aggressive) tend to have a similar suite of genes across species. Also, some physical traits that aren't deliberately selected for (eg white markings, lop ears) seem to be linked to desirable behavioral traits, so turn up in a lot of domestic species. It probably should be possible to domesticate zebras, but they reproduce fairly slowly and it takes many generations.

</li><li> Not so recently, people born with deformities or severe physical abnormalities had no opportunities besides joining circuses or freak attractions, and would have a social circle composed solely of other "performers" and a few "normal" individuals, which would often lead to family lines of "freaks" with similar conditions.
