However, it is distinct from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a> in that it does not focus simply on characters who frequently display self-centered behavior (often for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">comedic effect</a>), but explores the mindset of characters whose behavior is <a class="urllink" href="http://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/">strongly symptomatic of narcissistic personality disorder.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</p><p>The narcissist appears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">literally in love with themselves</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessSelfPromoter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessSelfPromoter">present themselves as perfect</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">expect you to agree</a>. When these expectations are not met, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">react with indignation and hostility towards those who dare deny them that to which they feel entitled</a>. Moreover, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodyDoesntLoveRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodyDoesntLoveRaymond">highly self-conscious of how others view them</a>, they are generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnapologetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnapologetic">indifferent to the harm they cause in furtherance of their goals</a>.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is Narcissus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>. Their story was first told by Ovid, which makes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. One version of the myth is that Narcissus coldly turned down a beautiful woman named Echo, who as a result faded away to nothing but a literal echo. Angered by his callousness and vanity, Aphrodite cursed Narcissus to fall in unrequited love with the next person he saw—which was his own reflection in the river, which he did until he died, whereupon his body was transformed into a flower. This is a perfect (if minimalist) description of the conflict within the narcissist - somebody who loves themselves, but at the same time never feels loved <em>by</em> themselves. Thus, they try to fill this hole with the love of others. Real Life Narcissists often have rather fragile egos when things <em>do</em> go wrong for them, and they may well do so since the Narcissist is rarely as clever, talented or charming as they think they are.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>It is insufficient for a character to simply be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">vain</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">excessively preoccupied with their selfish desires</a> to qualify for this trope. Rather, <strong>ALL</strong> the following requirements must be met in order to qualify.
</p><ol><li> The character's personality is overtly permeated by their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">grandiosity</a>. In all their interactions with others, a pathological narcissist firmly believes themselves to be vastly superior to those around them and (more importantly) expects recognition of this "fact". While capable of faking humility, all narcissists are angered by the mere hint they are being denied the recognition "owed" to them. Likewise, they deeply resent anyone who draws attention away from them or in any way encroaches on their claim of superiority. The "extinction burst" is a well-known phenomenon when someone finally calls them out on their bullshit and makes the narcissist realize that they can no longer control them. The more arrogant and prideful examples are likely to unleash a gigantic torrent of verbal abuse, while the more depressive ones will instead launch into a massive pity party about how much worse the target has made their life. Either way, escalations into physical attacks, scorched-earth revenge campaigns, or even faking a suicide attempt just for the attention are not at all uncommon.
</li><li>The character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">self-absorbed</a> to the point that they consistently prioritize their own desires at others' expense. Due to their grandiose sense of entitlement, narcissists have little (if any) qualms disregarding others' needs and personal boundaries to further their goals. If they <em>do</em> take someone else's needs and desires into consideration, then it is likely an opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency">grandstand for attention</a> by congratulating themselves for their sheer magnanimity, or, worse, as a bargaining chip or to have something to hold over the other person in the future.
</li><li> The character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodyDoesntLoveRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodyDoesntLoveRaymond">extremely self-conscious of how they're perceived by others</a>. Despite having little regard for those around them, their peace of mind hinges on receiving recognition of their self-importance from others. However, unlike a character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a>, a pathological narcissist's grandiosity is not <em>dependent</em> on others' validation. Rather, it is the fact that these characters' egos are so inherently bloated that they perceive anything less than near-constant praise and adulation as a grievous injustice. Don't count on them to give anyone else the same level of respect they expect to receive for themselves. If they absolutely must acknowledge the superiority of another, they'll give the shallowest of lipservice.
</li><li> The character regularly displays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism">glaringly low tolerance for criticism</a> and a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">unwillingness to take responsibility for mistakes or outright wrongdoing</a>. If someone dislikes them, the only possible reason is that the other person is a "hater" who's just jealous or inherently negative. Any apologies for toxic behavior, if they do come, are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderedApology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderedApology">insincere formalities</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackhandedApology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackhandedApology">attempts to shift blame and save face</a>, and either way are hollow and meaningless because the narcissist doesn't actually believe that they did anything wrong, but they also know that they only stand to lose by not deigning to apologize. On the upside, a narcissist's obsession with projecting an image of infallibility renders them capable of internalizing at least <em>SOME</em> set of moral guidelines.
</li><li> The character has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">insatiable appetite</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">acclaim</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespotismJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespotismJustifiesTheMeans">power</a>. Regardless of how much success or popularity they obtain, a narcissist's bloated sense of entitlement will always leave them unsatisfied in the long-term. Consequently, such characters inevitably feel driven to seek out ever greater levels of self-aggrandizement. As a result of their self-centeredness and diminished empathy, narcissists have little (if any) qualms flouting rules and personal boundaries to further such aims. Their success and overall functionality is contingent on how good they are at selling themselves to people and keeping them hooked; even the highest-functioning examples can have everything come crashing down when they piss off or hurt the wrong people, and low-functioning examples are generally friendless, unsuccessful losers whose lives are marked by ceaseless drama, a revolving door of people, and a persistent "weight of the world"/"eternal sufferer" attitude born from continual perceived victimhood.

</li><li> Donquixote Doflamingo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is one of the most odious and vile malignant narcissists in all of anime and manga. Supremely self-absorbed and firmly convinced of his absolute superiority and right to be beyond reproach and consequence due to his royal blood, his public face as a Warlord hides what he truly is: a cruel, sadistic tyrant who defines people's worth by their ability to be useful to him and displays extreme rage and almost gleeful hatred towards anyone who gets in his way or makes him look bad, and, when desperate, demonstrates that he will stop at absolutely nothing to get his way, even if it means killing an entire country. His supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> to his inner circle (which, for a while, appeared to be his one redeeming trait) is also revealed to be a sham, as he is perfectly willing to use them as martyrs and sacrificial lambs for his cause. When defeated and captured, he refuses to take any sort of responsibility for his actions and instead seems to be overjoyed at the fact that the World Government is facing a possible war over the power vacuum that his capture created. Lastly, while he may have had a horrifying and traumatic past, flashbacks make it very clear that most of it is his own damn fault, and his brother (one of the most genuinely nice and sympathetic characters in the series) went through the exact same things that Doflamingo went through, which lends a great deal of credence to his theory that Doflamingo was just innately evil.

While he does care about them on some level, Scirocco largely views his minions in terms of what they can do for or to him and uses constant emotional manipulation to keep them in line (especially the women). Even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a> rhetoric contains an undercurrent of "only <em>I</em> can save the world."

Unlike some examples, she's actually more of a textbook case of Narcissism. She has a strong need to be seen as important and to be admired, claiming that she works and studies harder than everyone else, and so shouldn't be seen as anything less than great by her classmates. She is bothered when people talk badly about her, thinking that it must be because they are jealous of the relationship she has with her crush. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">She also believes that she was bullied back in elementary school, just like Shoko was</a>, even though in reality she was a bystander who laughed at the bullying and was responsible for turning Shoya into the class scapegoat. But, of course, Kawai appears incapable of acknowledging these flaws, and ultimately believes she can do no wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> has a few examples.
<ul><li> There's Rei and Minako, but they vary in terms of how they perceive themselves. Rei's attitude is "Well of course I'm beautiful and adorable doesn't everybody know that?" While Minako is more "To be so beautiful, surely this <em>must</em> be a crime!" Rei often lacks self-awareness when she gets in the mood, and Minako tends to be very grandiose and hammy when proclaiming her good looks.
</li><li> For a villainous example, there's Queen Nehellenia from the fourth arc, whose vanity was so bad she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> devoured the dreams of everyone in her kingdom, which turned her subjects into living nightmares and transformed her planet into a dark wasteland, all for the sake of making sure her beauty is never ruined by age. The fourth season of the first anime even ends with her getting resealed in her prison dimension and being okay with it because it means she'll be beautiful, and the fifth season opens with her floating in a void filled with mirrors to which she can eternally gaze upon herself. She doesn't care about anyone or anything except for how she looks and that others see her as beautiful, and she <em>really</em> hates Sailor Moon due to jealous and paranoid beliefs that the Moon Princess is actively mocking her.</span>

While in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em>, his main motivation is to prove himself the equal of his adoptive brother, come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers (2012)</a></em>, he's become a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">megalomaniac</a>, obsessed with conquering Earth so that he can force humanity to worship him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>, justifying his bloody campaign as bringing peace to Earth when really, he is motivated in no small part to prove himself as great a king as his father, Odin. During this timedespite having been reserved, most of the time, before thisloses his cool when his power and/or authority is challenged, shouting people down with declarations of how great and powerful he is. (The alarming shift in behavior between films is explained by the fact that, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/loki/on-screen">according<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to Marvel's official site, "unbeknownst to him, the Scepter was also influencing him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">fueling his hatred</a> over his brother Thor and the inhabitants of Earth.") Getting his arse whooped by the Hulk and being locked in the dungeons of Asgard doesn't seem to have in any way tempered his arrogance because come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>, his reign over Asgard whilst disguised as Odin features a literal monument to his vanity and he's written an epic tragedy about the life of his fallen son, ergo, himself. Thor, having deduced that Odin is actually Loki in disguise, makes insulting remarks about Loki as though he isn't there, causing Loki to be visibly irritated despite his attempts to maintain the facade.

His explosive rage when faced with anything even remotely perceivable as a petty slight and scorched-earth approach to getting the last laugh when bested by Peter are also very telling.

But, like real narcissists, he's not content to simply admire himself and must devise ways of hurting others—in his case, up to and including drugging one of his master's creditors/house guests.

It is revealed in the last book to have inadvertently started the Roman-Greek demigod war because he gave his blessing to a decedent on the promise he would be raised to be the most important god in the Legion above even the king of Olympus Zeus/Jupiter. He thinks he is perfect and is several times manipulated by flattery yet is willing to bully or murder demigods on a whim if he thinks it will benefit him in some way and can only really think in terms of how a situation is affecting him. His sister Artemis is the only one he shows any type of respect or concern for.
<ul><li> This is even more blatantly obvious in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTrialsOfApollo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTrialsOfApollo">The Trials of Apollo</a>" where for a while, all he does is whine about how unfair his punishment is and how much it sucks to be human.

While he cares for his lovers, he doesn't care for their feelings and what they might think about him having other flings, and always expects people to have opinions and thoughts that would suit his agenda best. He likes to surround himself with beautiful things, is a hedonist and only his care for his mounts and country keeps him likeable.

He frequently thinks of himself as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">like a god</a>.

He ticks off an impressive number of symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He has an inflated sense of his own abilities, achievements, talents, and prowess, and has a strong sense of entitlement to the positions of Mortal Sword of the Black-Winged Lord and later the Herald of Mother Dark, which he claims are righteously his. He thinks nothing of using others and lacks the ability to consider them as more than his pawns, to be used as he sees fit. Only his own opinion has any value to Clip. Kedeviss insinuates that Clip may be envious of Nimander and his kin, as they have actually met Anomander Rake while he hasn't, and Skintick suspects that Clip is occupied by fantasies of his fated meeting with Anomander Rake, in which the latter has to step down when faced with Clip's fury.

After obviously losing and being cast into Hell, he becomes Emperor there, claiming "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven" and seeks to corrupt mankind so that they will worship him instead of God, in order to gain vengeance on God for refusing Lucifer what he believes is rightfully his. He's so full of himself that when he meets Sin, he's initially attracted to her because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">looks so much like him</a>.

He's prideful and boasts about how he's born to lead and everyone should be grateful to him for doing so, and that when they question him they just don't <em>understand</em> how his way is best. He loves to throw around his weight, bullying cats on his border, starving his captive just because he can, making anyone who questions him fear him, and becoming eager at the thought of making himself more powerful and expanding his territory. He's extremely self-conscious about how others view him and spends part of the book wondering if cats are talking about him behind his back, and how confronting them about it might look.
</li><li> Jo Utting from the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KindOfCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KindOfCruel">Kind of Cruel</a></em> is a textbook example of this trope, with therapist Ginny commenting she's a classic psychologically abusive narcissist. She's critical and controlling, especially towards her sister-in-law, Amber, lashing out at her one minute and then pretending nothing happened the next and expecting her to play along and contradicting herself constantly.

<ul><li> Like many real-life high-functioning sociopaths and sadists, Ramsay shows several narcissistic traits. He's overly confident in his abilities, his relations are shallow and only for the sake of his own pleasure, and his inflated ego is easily wounded by his father's pragmatic remarks.
</li><li> While a brilliant statesman and a highly skilled military strategist, Tywin is also extremely vain, insensitive, and self-absorbed. He equates his ambition with that of his House and the Kingdom and so, expects nothing less than total obedience from those around him.
</li><li> Cersei, much like her father, has a pronounced sense of self-worth. She is also practically a textbook case. Cersei sees herself as far more intelligent and powerful than she actually is. Her love for her brother Jaime is because she sees him as a reflection of herself if she were a man (which is also why she is notably distraught over his missing hand rather than any impact that it could ever have on his life). She loves her children, but moreso as extensions of herself than as human beings. She takes any perceived (real or not) slight extremely seriously and will often come up with forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> for it, even when she has absolutely nothing to gain by doing so. She also often tends to devalue and ruthlessly criticize and tear down those who come into contact with her. So, truly, due to the way Cersei's mind works, she is almost fundamentally incapable of <em>not</em> thinking everything is about her and ties back to her. So even on a more general level, Cersei is truly incapable of placing anyone's interest before her own.

It wasn't as obvious in the early seasons since her adversaries at the time were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">much worse</a>, but even back then, it became clear that she freed the slaves of Essos less because it was the right thing to do and more for the adoration and the assurance of having loyal subjects for when she took over. And even though her consort Daario was the first man she was free to love by choice, she broke up with him because he had nothing to offer her politically. Her entire campaign to conquer Westeros had no greater motivation beyond her belief that the Iron Throne was rightfully hers by blood, meaning she had no desire to break the wheel of nobility like she claimed; she just wanted to be the one on top, and she's baffled when the populace doesn't view her as their rightful queen but an invading conqueror. She romances Jon Snow only because he's the King in the North and it would add his lands to what would be hers, but when she finds out he's actually her nephew, she was more distraught by his greater claim to the Iron Throne than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest">Surprise Incest</a>.

Beholders are also very good at noticing even the slightest difference in another beholder. A beholder with slightly bumpier skin or slightly sharper teeth is as much a hated rival as a beholder with more obvious differences. Every beholder's belief that it is a perfect reflection of the Great Mother is exacerbated by the Great Mother being a shapeshifter who adopts a form that matches that of the beholder looking at her, thus reinforcing the beholder's narcissism.

He's been also often interpreted as having clinical depression due to his lack of motivation and positive emotions as well as his self-defeating behavior and occasional suicidal ideation.

He also tries to be the cool guy so that people will feel comfortable around him and don't leave him at all, something which has happened in the past and has created him a complex. Not that he would come out and say it; better try passive-aggressive remarks in the form of concerned thoughts. There's also how much he wants things exactly as he envisions in spite of his carefree attitude, which he masks with niceness hoping that will make things go his way. His grandiose sense of projects without any backbone or purpose and insecurity about Diane also make him rather needy with his expressions of love being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandRomanticGesture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandRomanticGesture">Grand Romantic Gestures</a>.

He would often bask on the public's adoration while secretly falling apart because of how little he saw of himself in his audience's expectations.

</li><li> The Warden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a>.</em>
</li><li> The Incredibly Amazing Man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs">Super Noobs</a></em> is a big one as blatantly shown through his name. He is very arrogant and condescending towards other superheroes, concerns himself with his looks, is very inconsiderate of others and very destructive, and is obsessed with selling merchandise that revolves around him, especially merchandise that features images of him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>.
<ul><li> Chris McLean. His favorite thing is himself, to the point that he puts his image on many items that go along with the challenges.
</li><li> Justin as well. You almost always see him admiring his physique and face.
</li><li> Alejandro, though to a much lesser extent than the others. It's no wonder, considering he is heavily based off of Justin.
</li><li> Lightning pretty much believes he is the greatest thing in the universe. When not boasting about his athletic prowess, he's usually flexing his biceps and kissing them.
</li><li> Topher is absolutely obsessed with his appearance (especially his hair), which is no surprise given that he idolizes Chris <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and seeks to replace him as the show's host</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRidonculousRace">The Ridonculous Race</a></em>:
<ul><li> Don is an example as he constantly worries about the shininess of his teeth and makes some comments about his own looks when recapping previous episodes, although he is not much of it as Chris is
</li><li> Jacques and Josee also qualify as Jacques places a lot of concern about his hair and does not want oil to drip on it and Josee is obsessed with winning gold and throws tantrums when she places anywhere other than first. They are even willing to cheat in the race in order to maintain their huge narcissism.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a> in most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> adaptations, particularly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>. Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em>.
<ul><li> Knock Out from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> is even more narcissistic. True, he has displayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> with Breakdown, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has stated that it doesn't really matter whether he is attracted to males, females, or both because he is first and foremost in love with himself.
</li><li> Sentinel himself is also an example, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">Transformers: Dark of the Moon</a></em> where he proclaims himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a living god</a>. In most versions, he'll end up at least mildly villainous due to his narcissism.
</li></ul></li><li> Pizza Steve from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UncleGrandpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UncleGrandpa">Uncle Grandpa</a></em>.
</li><li> Jack Spicer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>. He constantly worries about his hair and even calls his robot minions "Jackbots".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfJonnyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfJonnyQuest">The New Adventures of Jonny Quest</a></em> has Zartan, an extremely vain, flamboyant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> type who appears in the episode "The Monolith Man." He is extremely handsome and dresses very flamboyantly. While experimenting with an unknown type of underground radiation, it turned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFaced">right side of his face</a> to stone. Now he is driven to find more of the same radiation in an effort to study it so he can undo the damage to his good looks. One problem: the crystals which give off the radiation are extremely volatile and tend to explode without warning, making it extremely difficult to mine. Zartan's mining operations suffer multiple accidents as a result of the crystals blowing up and killing the workers. Undaunted, Zartan demands his men press on and on because restoring his handsomeness is more important than the lives of his employees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> has Aku, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">Made of Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who demands tributes from the oppressed masses in the form of statues in his likeness. A good example of this is when he visits the Cult of Aku to see their statue. He applauds their efforts and adds that while it's an attractive replica, it pales in comparison to the real Aku. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he gives them a piece of his essence to worship.</span>
</li><li> Homer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>.
<ul><li> In one episode when he and Marge go to a marriage counselor, he's asked to list the most important people in his life, which are: Homer, Homer J. Simpson, and Captain McCool (which is what he calls himself).
</li><li> In the episode where gay marriage is legalized in Springfield, Homer imagines what it would be like to marry someone of the same sex, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">and pictures himself</a> married, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Selfcest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Selfcest">and making out, with himself</a> while a bunch of baby mini-Homers crawl on the floor.
</li></ul></li><li> Gumball from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> is fundamentally decent and hides his monstrous ego with genuine anxiety, but he's such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> he inserts himself into someone else's story and forces a happy ending where he saves the day on them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>: While Grievous has all the self-centered, self-absorbed, power-hungry traits of a narcissist it's not clear that he's really that fond of himself until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E10LairOfGrievous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E10LairOfGrievous">"Lair of Grievous"</a> reveals he's decorated his lair with a series of larger than life statues of himself, as a glorious war victor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em>: In the "Fractured Fairy Tale" episode "Leaping Beauty", the protagonist Beauty runs around spreading sunshine and flowers to all the other people in her town, until she crosses paths with a witch. Rather than cast a sleeping spell on Beauty, the witch casts a Boredom spell, which turns Beauty into a narcissist, admiring a mirror all day and singing her own praises to the point where the rest of the town falls asleep out of boredom.

He surrounds himself with brainwashed clones of himself, who he can possess at will and harvests to extend his lifespan and simply for ornamentation. Any mistake he makes must be hidden or obliterated and has left countless destroyed planets in his wake. He becomes enraged when confronted with his own errors, and after experiencing multiple failures attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum">destroy the universe</a> rather than lose control.
