</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arc</a> is the gift that keeps on giving. Whole fandoms have been known to run solely on the fuel of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">shipping vitriol</a> for years on end. Though they won't admit it, people <em>will</em> continue watching through a boring scene just to see whether this guy can work up the nerve to ask out that girl over there. But, for some reason, as readily as they attach themselves to potential couples, they shrug at the successful conclusion of the romance and move on. Yes, for all the grand arguments and fights over who will get with who that reach ridiculous levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>, when everything is said and done and the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">do become an item</a>? Past that climax point, you'll find that most of the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLoveIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLoveIsBoring">has completely lost interest.</a> On a basic level, you can blame human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment">Wish Fulfillment</a> mentality which romanticizes the exact phase of "getting together with someone" beyond all reason (see also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving">Wanting Is Better Than Having</a>).

It's also probably the underlying cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup">Last Minute Hookups</a> and characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookedUpAfterwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookedUpAfterwards">hooking up afterwards</a> being so common. It's a rare writer who seriously builds on plain vanilla <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLoveIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLoveIsBoring">True Love</a> as a pillar of the plot.
</p><p>Another contributing factor beyond audience apathy is that writing a convincing relationship, with genuine depth of character and development, is a much more difficult feat than pouring on the quick-reaction drama and will-they-won't-they, far above and beyond an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">Relationship Writing Fumble</a>. Once that crutch of anticipation "romance" is no longer there for the writer to lean on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">weaknesses in the writing suddenly show through that the audience was too distracted by the narrative tension to notice -- or care about -- earlier</a>. When the writing is too thin, there's just nothing much there afterwards (after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">They Do</a>) for the audience to care about or invest in. If the writing doesn't have actual substance, the writer can only really rely on cheap narrative tricks to keep their audience. On top of that, any problems or twists with an actual ongoing romance can end up being blood in the water for rival factions of shippers.

<ul><li> The finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan">Bakugan</a> Battle Brawlers</em> shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Dan and Runo</a> <em>finally</em> getting together, and the first episode of the sequel series, <em>Bakugan: New Vestroia</em>, has them still together.

</li><li> After Usagi and Mamoru got together in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> anime, they were shown together less and less; Mamoru's personality went from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">"mysterious" to "two-dimensional"</a> depending on how interested the writers were in him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KunihikoIkuhara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KunihikoIkuhara">Kunihiko Ikuhara</a> at one point joked that he wished he could just kill him off and hook Usagi up with Rei, and this is clearly evident by a failed attempt at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpMakeUpScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpMakeUpScenario">break-up arc</a> in <em>Sailor Moon R</em> that tried to create new tension between the pair, followed by just giving up and largely dropping Mamoru from major plotlines altogether. This was painfully noticeable in the last season when the new writers decided to play up Seiya's unrequited crush on Usagi from the manga by trying to build it into a more explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> arc, while Mamoru got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for most of the season, only returning in the last episode to reassure the audience that the main couple still existed. <br/>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> version avoids this trope by keeping Mamoru a well-developed (and much more badass) character even after the hook-up. Comparing his role in the fourth arc between manga and anime alone is dumbfounding; short version: in the former, he is a critical character to the storyline, getting focus arcs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">acquiring a major power-up</a>. In the anime adaptation, he's barely existent in the season and actually gets knocked out for the final episodes to even further reduce his impact on the plot (and his powerup became a MacGuffin for the enemy to try to use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is eventually used by Usagi and Chibiusa instead</span>).
</li><li> Fumiya liked Saori from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> since his first appearance. After several in-series years he asks her out properly and she agrees. After that the already minor Fumiya almost never pops up, and when he does it isn't related to Saori. You could easily mistake Takatsuki and Saori for a couple because their friendship was <em>significantly</em> more important than Saori dating Fumiya.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>: Peter Parker and Mary Jane, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a>. Peter and Mary Jane were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> for around 20 years. Joey Q, resident Editor in Chief, decides that Peter being single would lead to far more interesting stories than being tied down. Cue <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em>, massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">Ship Sinking</a>, Quesada <em>instantly</em> drawing more backlash than his already-controversial DC counterpart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio">Dan DiDio</a> ever managed. The newspaper strips, in contrast, continued to keep the duo together in a stable married relationship, while the alternate universe series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RenewYourVows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RenewYourVows">Renew Your Vows</a></em> also kept them together while making them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperFamilyTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperFamilyTeam">Super Family Team</a> with their child Annie May. After ten years, the mainstream versions of Peter and MJ were finally allowed to reconcile in Nick Spencer's run on the title...seemingly (and ironically) at the suggestion of Quesada himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderThePromise">Avatar: The Last Airbender  The Promise</a></em> runs into this with Aang and Katara. After they hooked up at literally the very end of the original series, the comic continuation has them as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a> couple and Katara being reduced to a far more secondary character, killing interest in both fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">and their friends</a>. They eventually do move past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a>, but beyond that there really isn't anything interestingly done with them bar maybe one moment where Katara reflects how their relationship mirrors the multicultural heritage of the colonies over which Aang and Zuko are currently arguing.
<ul><li> Mai and Zuko had similar problems - though they'd been together in the series proper, it only got focus in a handful of episodes and they spent far more time apart than together. When <em>The Promise</em> took the pairing to the center and removed the biggest reason for them to not like each other (Zuko's guilt about betraying his uncle), it became evident that the two had almost no chemistry, while Mai proved decidedly unsympathetic. It was so poorly received that it had people latching onto Zuko/<em>Suki</em> after they shared a few conversations, in the hopes that maybe the comic was leading in a different direction.

<ul><li> Romance is not the main reason people watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>. Nevertheless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">many people agree</a> that romance is badly handled in the series. The series first stuck up to the comic book-inspired romance between Oliver Queen (the titular character, Green Arrow) and Laurel Lance (Black Canary), even though the two spent most of their time together bickering and being mean-spirited throughout (Oliver had cheated on Laurel before the series started, so she had plenty of reasons to hate him, but still) which fans considered repulsive, wishing Oliver should hook up with Felicity Smoak, an erstwhile supporting character who was popular for her funny personality. Fast forward to Season 4 and Laurel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, making Felicity Oliver's sole love interest. The relationship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">overtook the series lore</a> with the angst reaching to soap opera levels, which in many ways was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">reminiscent of the whole Oliver/Laurel problem that people were so against</a>. Even as the show bounced back from the nadir that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Season 4</a>, the pairing was seen as the series' weakest point (especially in contrast to how its sister series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em> handled its main pairing) and was when the fanbase began to seriously criticize how the-then showrunners (Marc Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle) handled the show's direction. When Beth Schwartz took over as showrunner for the final two seasons, she made a point to improve and, most importantly, reduce the focus on the Olicity angst, a decision that was universally welcomed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a></em> was a series that seemed to be based entirely on the premise that the title character was clearly madly in love with her master, Tony Nelson, who constantly deals with the headaches created by her clumsy super-powered advances on him. The fifth season had the pair married to try and stave off a ratings decline and Jeannie and Tony were married at the start of the fifth season. Snuffing out the lead conflict of the show only hastened its demise, as it was cancelled after the season's conclusion. This might have been why the two reunion films involved plots breaking the couple up.
</li><li> In season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Britta and Troy's relationship</span> was interesting when it was two seasons of ship teases, but as soon as they got together, fans were unimpressed at the pairing. They wind up having an anticlimactic break up late in season 4.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em>'s Dave and Maddie. Despite this trope occasionally being known as <em>Moonlighting</em> Syndrome, the show didn't really suffer from the leads getting together, it suffered from the leads not being in the same room for about a year afterward. There was no point at which they were together as a couple at all.
</li><li> During the earliest episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>, George/Izzie was a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredPairing">Fan Preferred Pairing</a>. However, when the show's writers decided to make it canon, some of the loudest complaints of it came from former shippers of that pairing because of how abruptly both characters went from pining after other people to wangsting over each other and how it involved a cheating subplot that made them rather unlikeable, and the pairing was quickly nipped in the bud.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</a></em> didn't last very long after Lois and Clark got together. It probably wasn't helped by the many false starts; the episode where they finally got married for real was actually titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">"Swear to God, This Time We're Not Kidding"</a>, and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> which kept the writers' hands tied because Warner insisted that the marriage in the show coincide with the marriage in the comics. The comic book writers, amusingly, say they were ready to marry Lois and Clark off for <em>years</em> and had to wait on the TV show. So then... a case of real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: Ross and Rachel, who went through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> trek, were together for barely a season, broke up and returned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> territory for the next <em>seven years</em>. The writers themselves admitted they got them together too fast and couldn't make their actual relationship interesting. Despite the hype, many fans grew frustrated with the couple and lost interest. By the time a definitive conclusion was reached, most fans no longer cared. However, as can be seen below, Chandler and Monica played out differently.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty">Ugly Betty</a></em>, audiences were crying for Betty to hook up with the adorkable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> Henry. Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the cute/funny interactions that made the couple popular in the first place, the writers decided to throw in every bit of contrived soap-opera drama they could think of for the sake of "plot." Audiences got sick of it mighty quick, and before long Henry was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> back to Tucson with his babymama.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>: The jury is still out on whether Niles and Daphne finally hooking up made their relationship less or more interesting; some fans cite this as the moment when the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark">jumped the shark</a>. There are other factors. Keenan and Lloyd left the show <em>at that very moment</em> and other aspects of Seasons 8-10 were equally suspect. The eleventh season kind of bears this out, as N&amp;D are also far more interesting there. Ostensibly, the coupling had something to do with Kelsey Grammer's ego, as he wanted the focus to shift to the title character (something also rather botched until the eleventh season). Season 11 in general was a huge reverse shark-jump. But most viewers agree that Niles and Daphne got together at just the right time, as they had avoided irritating or losing the interest of the viewers by not dragging the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> on too long (as opposed to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Ross and Rachel</a>.) One could say that while Niles and Daphne suffered from this, they didn't <em>have</em> to, and they wouldn't have if Keenan and Lloyd had stayed. Incidentally, people forget that production problems is what made <em>Moonlighting</em>'s Maddie and Dave, this trope's poster child, suffer so severely from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingBedDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingBedDeath">Shipping Bed Death</a>: it's just more <em>difficult</em> to pull off a good post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> romance than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST-fueled</a> one.
</li><li> A rather bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a></em>. Sally, Tommy and Harry use Officer Don's radio scanner to listen to the private phone calls of a woman named Andrea and her cheating boyfriend, which they treat as though it were a show. This leads to them actually meeting Andrea and Harry dating her. Harry and Andrea have a nice, drama-free relationship, causing Sally and Tommy to complain that "the show has really gone downhill since Harry was introduced". They try to convince Harry to act like a jerk so that the "show" will be interesting again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> is sometimes accused of this, but as Mulder and Scully probably got together right around the same time as some other major changes in the show (it actually happened offscreen, but it was implied they first slept together around the end of Season 7, right before David Duchovny left) it's hard to say whether to blame the hookup or other factors for the deterioration in writing quality. The producers were certainly afraid of ending the UST between Mulder and Scully, often mentioning the <em>Moonlighting</em> Effect. Unfortunately they dallied so much we saw them get together only in the second movie.

She's so drippy whenever the subject of Mulder comes up ...I hate to say it but Scully does sound like she has completely fallen under Mulder's spell in he courtroom. She is publicly stating exactly the same sort of science fiction nonsense that she used to criticize Mulder for expressing.

</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> revival is an interesting case here (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeOverdosed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeOverdosed">as usual</a>). The first season of the new series had a fair bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a> between Rose and the Ninth Doctor, culminating in a romantic kiss in the finale. Then he became David Tennant. The relationship became a straight-up romance and lo, the flame wars started. Some loved it, some thought Rose had become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSue">Relationship Sue</a>, some thought the whole thing was a badly handled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>, some hated the idea of romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> at all; it didn't <em>kill</em> the show, but the fights are still going on. Increasing the effect was that whether the Doctor was romantically interested in Rose varied hugely, depending on who had written any given episode. It got even worse from Rose's brief return in Series 4. Her haters hated her appearing again, while many of her fans felt it negated one of the best companion departures.
</li><li> Caroline and Richard on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CarolineInTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CarolineInTheCity">Caroline in the City</a></em>. So much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a>, and so little of the caring once they got together. Oh my God.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: The much hyped Sam/Freddie pairing. When <em>iDate Sam &amp; Freddie</em> showed what an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName">Seddie</a> relationship would look like, this was the reaction of many fans. Sam and Freddie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">chemistry as bickering sidekicks</a> dissolves as soon as they get romantic and kills the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a> Seddie fans saw before the arc started. Every kiss is identical and not filled with much passion. Their constant fighting is no longer cute and instead shows a dysfunctional relationship. The generally accepted reason for it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanKress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanKress">Nathan Kress</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennetteMcCurdy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennetteMcCurdy">Jennette McCurdy</a>'s long friendship ruining their ability to show or feel passion for each other. They have both stated they dislike the idea of the Sam/Freddie pairing or that they want their characters to not end up with anyone, and Jennette has said that she dislikes filming romantic scenes and that kissing Nathan feels like kissing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">a brother</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed">Ed</a></em>. Part of the premise of the show was the unresolved romantic tension between main characters Ed (played by Tom Cavanagh) and Carol Vessey (played by Julie Bowen). They got together, ratings dropped, show cancelled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>: Angela and Hodgins broke up randomly, right after dealing with their issues relating to Angela's ex so they could get married. They realized they didn't trust each other. It didn't take, and they were married in a jail cell a season later.
</li><li> Both averted and played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a>.</em> They build on the relationships past the marriage stage with Turk and Carla and <em>technically</em> with Jordan and Dr. Cox (They're in a long-term non committed relationship with two children) but JD and Elliot have been playing the trope straight for almost the entire series. And did so until the last season, where they hooked up, finally grew up and stayed together for good. Dr. Cox and Jordan also got back together and stayed together.
</li><li> A complaint by some looking to explain a general decline in quality in the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>. Once Pam and Jim get together in between seasons 3 and 4, they became a little more boring. The writers tried replacing them with other will-they-won't-they tensions and love triangles, such as breaking up Angela/Dwight, and then later introducing and breaking up Andy/Erin and Michael/Holly, but none of them had the same appeal as Jim and Pam's UST. Viewers complained that the show was turning into a "soap opera". This was exacerbated by trying to drive a wedge between Jim and Pam post-marriage with other people who were fawning for them, which seemed like quite a reach that either would fall for a temptation. There isn't a whole lot of drama of whether Jim would ever think of cheating on Pam considering he was so in love with her, he bought an engagement ring <em>the week they started dating</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, with Dan/Serena and Chuck/Blair.

Other people (mostly the Dan/Blair and Serena/Nate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipMates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipMates">Ship Mates</a>) are tired of the "Chuck does something horrible, they break up, Chuck redeems himself, Blair forgives him, they get back together" and the "Serena redeems herself, Dan forgives her, they get back together" shtick. Which in the case of Chuck/Blair is happening for about the 6th time.
</li><li> Dan/Blair gained fans during the fourth season but when the two actually started dating the viewers disliked it so much that the ratings plummeted to the point that the show barely got renewed for a final season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> may be in danger of this with Olivia and Peter. The writers promise that their relationship is central to the story. But every time it seems just about to start, it goes pear-shaped.

Blaine/Kurt and Will/Emma have also fallen victim to this from the fandom. The former was the pairing was championed as being the first big mainstream gay pairing. Blaine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> status ended up turning fans sour. While with the latter, Will ended up being a jerk in the second season and it reached the point where fans started to root for Emma to stay with the blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a> she married.

They Really Do Love Each Other</a>, but in season 7 their relationship is... kindest put, a dragged out mess, with both of them acting stupid (one brought up but ignored plot point is that House is a worse doctor when he's with her, and both of them seem fine with it), the only joy seems to be offscreen sex and House acts like even more of a dick while she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a>. This continued after the break-up, as any friendship is gone, his annual breakdown isn't sympathy inducing cos he's acting like an abusive ex, she compromises patient care to get back at him, and even though he does get nicer in season 8 after a prison stint for crashing his car into her house, she's off the show in that season and nobody seems to care about her absence much.

SNK did enjoy using it at first with <em>Fatal Fury 3</em> and the <em>Real Bout</em> series and the earlier <em>KOF</em> games as well. However, over the course of the 2000's, while Terry is considered iconic for SNK he didn't really have any role in the <em>KOF</em> series anymore and is pretty much just there to appease older fans. Some have even feared that SNK would kill off Blue Mary since unlike Terry who used to be a main character Mary was always a secondary one. That and Terry's girlfriends have a tendency to end up dead (in the anime, anyway). Fortunately that hasn't happened yet.

Averted in the sixth season, where they are together but their relationship is not given too much screentime. The fact that both are both interesting and <em>important</em> characters in ways that have nothing to do with their romance helps a lot.
</li><li> Happened in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> between Korra and Mako. The first season had them at the center of a messy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveQuadrangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveQuadrangle">Love Quadrangle</a>, which concluded with Mako leaving his girlfriend Asami for Korra. When the second season came and the writers had to show them as a couple, Korra and Mako just didn't work. They had no real chemistry together and were constantly arguing over different opinions and expectations, and their respective jobs as the Avatar and a police officer getting in the way of their relationship. At the end of the season, they both acknowledge they just don't work as a couple and break up for good. The following seasons had them as just friends, and although things were a little awkward at first, they did work out fine that way and Korra found another love interest <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asami</span> with whom she formed a more functional relationship.
</li><li> An odd case happens between Duncan and Gwen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>. Their friendship was realistic and well-received, though Gwen always tried to make it clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesNotMyBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesNotMyBoyfriend">they were only friends</a>. Due to this, Duncan suddenly kissing Gwen in <em>World Tour</em> not only felt like it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">came completely out of nowhere</a>, but resulted in the infamously disliked Gwen/Duncan/Courtney love triangle storyline. When it was time to actually show Duncan and Gwen as a couple, their every interaction was awkward and forced, with none of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">charm or chemistry that they had when they were just friends</a>. To make matters worse, the writers couldn't help from dropping hints that Duncan was still into Courtney the entire time, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">makes you wonder why the hell he cheated on her with Gwen in the first place</a>.
</li><li> Allura/Lance was never the most popular pairing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, but it did have a reasonably dedicated following - one that was decidedly not interested in it when it became canon. On top of reading as a rebound due to coming right after Allura's breakup with Lotor (which meant that Lance was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a> in his <em>relationships</em> as well as everything else in life) and the "wear the girl down" implications the relationship had for Allura, the writers didn't seem to have any idea how to handle the pairing or how to make interesting interactions with them. It dominated most of their scenes in the seventh and eighth seasons, and mostly came across as tedious and cliche, on top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">largely eating</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Lance's characterization.</a> Its culmination in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Allura's death, followed by Lance inexplicably turning Altean and giving up his dreams of being a space pilot to become a farmer</span>, just made the whole thing even less appealing.

The rest of the show is pretty much about them starting a life together, with a heavy focus on the emotional interdependence of their relationship. The second half (aka "After Story") is also generally considered the superior part of the show.
</li><li> Averted on the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em> when 3/4 into it Daisuke starts a relationship with Riku, but it takes time for them to adapt and strengthen their love.
</li><li> This is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> between Renton and Eureka is supplemented by the Coralian sub-plot. The very next episode after they get together, the Coralian plot takes center stage.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> by Sasahara and Ogiue.

In contrast, the anime was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a> right before their first official date.

In fact, a good number of fans will tell you that you wouldn't miss much by <em>skipping</em> the first season leading up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> becoming, well, official.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em>. At first it looks like most shoujos, with mildly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> (on Yukino's part, at least), some uncertainty whether Yukino and Arima will get together. This situation lasts for as late as... the second episode/volume. <em>Then</em> things start getting interesting: the threats to their relationship are not random encounters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Leads</a>, but their own weaknesses and selfishness, and the focus is given more to the emotional maturing of the characters rather than the relationship itself.
</li><li> Sakura Tsukuba's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MekakushiNoKuni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MekakushiNoKuni">The Land of The Blindfolded</a></em> manga took a very similar approach as <em>Kare Kano</em>, following the relationship threats and emotional growth of what became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanade and Aru</span> out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>: Interestingly, Haruka and Michiru inverted the situation to their benefit compared to Mamoru×Usagi pairing. Despite being a creator-acknowledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">blatantly cute</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakarazukaRevue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakarazukaRevue">butch/femme dynamic</a> and no alternative ships in the fandom, their relationship was always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">selectively</a> (albeit increasingly) explicit enough to keep the fans interested.
</li><li> Averted in the shoujo anime/manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SnowWhiteWithTheRedHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SnowWhiteWithTheRedHair">Snow White with the Red Hair</a></em>, where the main couple are more or less a foregone conclusion from the first episode and are definitively together by the end of the first anime season. This wouldn't be all that unusual except that this corresponds to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fourteenth</span> chapter in an ongoing manga now over <em>70 chapters long</em>. The second season (and ensuing manga chapters) have them as an established <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, with conflict arising mainly from external forces and plenty of relationship development with other characters as well as each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>: Kirito and Asuna <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get together in the first volume/by episode 10 of the Anime and are married (due in part to the ease of marriage in an online game) in a few scenes and less than a day in universe. Chronologically they then adopt a daughter within two weeks and thus the majority of the series has them in a stable relationship with a budding family.</span> Far from killing the ship, this simply shifts the focus to the relationships between them and Yui, along with the emotional impact of their various trials.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora">Toradora!</a></em> where the establishment of Ryuji and Taiga didn't kill the interest in their romance, rather it enhanced it.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret">My Monster Secret</a></em>. Author Eiji Masuda had the main couple of Asahi and Youko get together halfway through the manga because he thought dragging it out any longer would be unreasonable both to the readers and the characters. However, he didn't miss a beat and maintained the emphasis on over-the-top supernatural comedy that had been there since the beginning — he just occasionally added in chapters showing Asahi and Youko on dates, which were charmingly adorable. It helped that the series always had a large ensemble cast to help carry the story (and to engage in wacky hijinks of their own), <em>and</em> that there was a major driving plot in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> that ran almost all the way through the series.

While some fans thought that putting a man like John Constantine on a stable relationship, specially after almost all his friends and lovers have died horrible horrible deaths, was a really bad idea, the last years of Hellblazer comics are worth reading as his partner, Epiphany Greaves, is a reckless young alchemist rebel woman that knows that his life has been tainted by all the deaths and dangers that his lifestyle provides, not to mention she's a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>.

</li><li> Inversions of this trope are known to occur too: For instance, pretty much everyone agrees that Dave and Lisa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em>, after subverting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> by starting an intimate relationship in the second episode, are much more intriguing and entertaining when they're together as a couple, and that their break-up was a possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpTheShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpTheShark">Jump the Shark</a> moment.
</li><li> Averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> with John and Aeryn, probably because they kept the two of them from getting together without possibility of "takebacks" until about three-quarters of the way through the last season. Other plausible reasons: they had to keep it secret because John was scared of Scorpius finding out, resulting in minimal screen time; when they were open about it they spent more time running for their lives and spinning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">implausible plan after implausible plan in a desperate attempt to stay alive</a> than in bed; they were the only two leads who looked fully human (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">that shouldn't stop</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> fans); or Claudia Black and Ben Browder may be just that good, which is very likely true even if any one of the above is <em>also</em> true. Season 3's "Meltdown", generally considered the worst episode of the series, was also the one that featured the most explicit John/Aeryn action... though the sexy times were pretty hot, so it wasn't John and Aeryn's fault. Reportedly, Ben Browder actually wanted to invert the trope. Citing that "everyone knows that putting the leads together ends the show", he suggested early on that, in their first meeting, Aeryn and John should have slept together and then spent the rest of the show <em>denying</em> they had and trying to <em>ignore</em> the sexual tension. They were heavily implied to sleep together in the first season episode "a human reaction", they denied it <em>fast</em>.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> by Blair, who tells Chuck that she's worried they'll be boring now they're in a relationship (a major concern for the fans). He replies that they could "never be boring" and was proven right - their subversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a> was dramatic, heartwarming and hilarious, and the main fan displeasure was that the cameras cut away whenever they started to roleplay or pulled out handcuffs.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> wanted Wash and Zoe to hook up onscreen, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> wanted to show a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> couple <em>(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">at first</a>)</em>. And they were still fun to watch!
</li><li> Averted to a degree on the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk">Queer as Folk</a></em> when playboy Brian Kinney and his boytoy-turned-fiancé Justin realized that getting married would mean a slow torturous death to their relationship when they both grew bitter with resentment for going against their character's natures. Of course, this led to a serious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> for shippers.
</li><li> Rachel and Finn on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> initially managed to invert this; it was the constant <em>delaying</em> of them getting together that made them boring to shippers, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">the conclusion</a> was so inevitable. This was especially true when, after the creators promised that for Season 2 they would keep them together and "shift the focus to other couples," they instead broke them up again and did an <em>exact repeat</em> of their storyline in Season 1, dragging up the same two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">romantic false leads</a>. In Season 3, the trope was played straighter; the two remained together for the bulk of the season, but they continued to get the most focus, with the resentment over it such that when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Finn proposed</span> in a mid-season episode, #RachelSayNo became a Twitter trending topic. It probably wouldn't be quite as fraught if it weren't for the fact that some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">fan preferred couples</a> (e.g. Brittany/Santana, Quinn/Puck) remained in various stages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> during Finn and Rachel's never-ending, increasingly more and more contrived arcs. Only the untimely death of actor Cory Monteith, and the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">decision to have Finn killed off out of respect</a>, brought an end to this.
</li><li> Inverted, possibly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>. Penny and Leonard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finally had sex and became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a></span> at the beginning of the third season, and it didn't hurt the ratings any. Although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the show did nothing interesting with the couple and then they broke up. BUT they get back together in the fifth season and this time around it's much better handled with the two intentionally taking it slow at first, make a point of being more open and honest with each other, and Penny even manages to say "I Love You"!</span>
<ul><li> They finally get married a few seasons later, and both they and Howard/Bernadette remain well-handled and written, as the story shows the dramas of relationships and married life without going overboard.
</li></ul></li><li> A possible aversion of this occurred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em>. At the end of season one Robin and Marian admitted their feelings for one another, and in season two they become engaged. In the season two finale, they have an impromptu wedding whilst awaiting execution. Now, despite there being <em>plenty</em> of material here for Robin and Marian to have spent season three as husband and wife, avoiding the wrath of Guy of Gisborne and battling Prince John's armies together, the episode in question ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marian's death at the hands of Guy</span>. According to the writers, they felt that they "had taken Marian's story as far as it could go," the insinuation clearly being that once the Marian-centric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> had been resolved, the writers felt that there was no further need for Marian to remain on the show. Two new love interests for Robin were duly trotted out in season three. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>? You betcha! This policy came back to bite the writers firmly in the ass: Robin×Kate (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a>) never got a chance to reach a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingBedDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingBedDeath">Shipping Bed Death</a> because no one gave a shit about it to begin with.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> with Worf×Jadzia and even more spectacularly with Odo×Kira, who had an entire <em>episode</em> devoted to getting them together and afterward were completely, utterly in love and acted like it, while still being their normal, fiery, badass, amazing selves.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>, where Chuck and Sarah are more entertaining and watchable as a happy couple as they ever were when they wanted to be but couldn't for various reasons.
</li><li> The entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou">Mad About You</a></em> was the aversion of this trope. It focused on a generally happily married couple living in an apartment in New York City. It ran for 7 seasons. The difference there though is that they were <em>already</em> married when the show began, rather than slowly getting together over a long period of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> averts this with Amy and Rory; after their wedding at the end of Season 5 they still have just as much continuing development as before, and they're still just as much fun to watch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rhoda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rhoda">Rhoda</a></em> famously seemed to avert this by allowing its title character to get married after years of struggling on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em>. A mere eight weeks into the program saw a wedding with some of the highest ratings in the history of television. However, in the case of <em>Rhoda</em>, it wasn't the audience who got bored - it was the writing staff. After two seasons of a happily married Rhoda, the writers decided she worked better as a single woman and opened Season 3 with a bitter separation and concluded in their divorce. Viewers abandoned the show in droves, and while it survived another two seasons, it never recovered.
</li><li> Averted by Marshall and Lily on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, who became actually <em>more</em> interesting (not that they had actually been dull before...just less prominent) when they stopped being Ted's roommates and got embroiled in the realities of married life. Also averted with Barney and Robin. Barney's basically just his crazy, funny self no matter what...but the writers didn't anticipate the chemistry they had and wrote the break-up into the show before seeing it. Eventually, they put them back together.
</li><li> Averted by all three couples on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>. They're all married, so there was no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a> to begin with.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> by John Sheridan and Delenn. It helped that they were in the middle of a war when they got together, and when that war ended they got to deal with another one — and as soon as those wars were over, they went right in to helping straighten out the galaxy from the mess it had been left in <em>after</em> said wars. Who's got time to get bored with a romance when you're on the brink of annihilation every week?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> didn't become popular until Sam and Diane got together as a couple in the second season. But it did stay popular after Diane got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, Harm and Mac didn't become a couple until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>. You can't get more of an aversion than that (apart from never becoming one at all).
</li><li> A lot of fans complained about Naomi and Emily's story in Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> for averting this; having got together at the end of Season 3, Season 4 was all about them dealing with trying to keep the relationship going through Naomi's infidelity, a not atypical problem in real-life long-term relationships. Many people thought they should have split up, possibly just to watch them go through the (admittedly adorable) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arc</a> again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendOfTheSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendOfTheSeeker">Legend of the Seeker</a></em> did not get worse at the end of the first season when Richard and Kahlan said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Fuck it, we just won't have sex</a>" and got together for good. In fact, it got considerably <em>better</em> — although it helped that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> was accompanied by a general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a> that was only partially caused by said upgrade. Possibly helped by the fact that anyone that has read the novels would see this as a foregone conclusion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>: While Angela and Hodgins remain an example, Bones and Booth have remained interesting even after getting together.
</li><li> This trope is the reason why Howard and Vince of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh">The Mighty Boosh</a></em> didn't get together. The creators stated they originally planned on them becoming a couple during the TV show, but decided against it for fear of ruining the dynamic of the characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoelFielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoelFielding">Noel Fielding</a> says if Howard and Vince do ever get together, it wont be until he and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianBarratt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianBarratt">Julian Barratt</a> know for sure they're done with the characters.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>, both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Andy and April</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leslie and Ben</span> become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couples</a> about a season after the dynamics between them were introduced, and most would agree that the show only benefited from these pairings. On the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ann and Chris</span> becoming one (after years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>) was essentially a setup for the characters being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a></span> half a season later.
</li><li> An inverted case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander">Outlander</a></em> in that the main character, Claire Randall, is already married to someone else. But upon getting thrown back in time, circumstances force her to marry the other main character, Jamie Fraser, whom she is not, initially, in love with. As with the novel series the show is based on, the marriage takes place early in the story so that the couple's developing relationship becomes the focal element of the series.
</li><li> Discussed in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecretLifeOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecretLifeOfUs">The Secret Life of Us</a></em>. Evan, a writer, is explaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">Unresolved Sexual Tension</a> to Gabrielle, giving a number of examples, the last (and, he says, best) of which is Max and 99 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart">Get Smart</a></em>. When Gabrielle points out that the two got married, Evan points out that the show wasn't very good afterwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss">Who's the Boss?</a></em>: Tony and Angela getting together was less the start or cause of the show's demise and more of the show's last ditch effort to stay alive. At that point, Tony and Angela resolving their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a> was the only card they had left to play. But by then, the audience had grown bored of the whole thing and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> was met with a collective yawn and cancellation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>: It was widely speculated that the show would never put Castle and Beckett together, as the show was powered by the UST between the two leads, and the fandom is powerfully driven by shipping. Even Castle's actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion">Nathan Fillion</a>, was openly against it. However, the two finally hooked up (although they haven't married yet) at the end of Season 4, and have been happily in a relationship all through Season 5. Even Fillion admits he was wrong and the "Moonlighting Curse" has been broken. Season 4 (and season 3 to a lesser extent) are considered weak points, because the attempts to keep Castle and Beckett apart were pretty flimsy anyway. A good example is "The Limey". Castle and Beckett were each given a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a> in the episode. Interestingly, instead of audience anger being directed toward the false leads (which happened previously with False Leads such as Detective Demming and Josh Davidson), the majority of the frustration instead landed on <em>Castle and Beckett</em>, since they stubbornly refused to have a mature conversation about their feelings for each other, making it a rather obvious attempt to artificially extend the tension, leading fans to simply say "get on with it!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em>: Jake and Amy. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> finally resolved, they grew to become a loving, supportive, and stable couple, without detracting from the show at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em> avoided the scorn that befell its parent series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> with the romantic subplot of its main characters, Barry Allen/The Flash and Iris West. The two hooked up and became engaged in Season 3 and were married in Season 4 (with Iris changing her name to Iris West-Allen) with the full support of the fanbase. Although not without tension and a minor case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">Ship-to-Ship Combat</a> (Barry + Caitlin, the so-called "Snowbarry" was a popular alternative), the pairing is handled gracefully and never detracts from the show's direction. Rather than dumbing them down to angsty teenagers, these two <em>matured</em> as they started the relationship, another reason why there is little reason for people to hate.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em>, at around the halfway point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Maxim</a> actually <em>marries</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Selan</a> after narrowly beating what seems to be the big bad at first. A year passes and it is revealed there's still a lot more to the game. It could be said that the trope is fully inverted, because in this story the leading up to the romance is fairly underplayed but in the latter half of the game their relationship is important to the plot.
</li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> games drag the romance sidequests out until the very end, or simply make it so that once you've finished the sidequest, that's the end of all dialogue options with that person. However, this is averted in the Merrill and Anders Romances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, where either party can become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> with Hawke and move in during Act II. Both romance arcs continue from there, based on the personal drama of the respective love interest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fact that the series allows romances to be continued from one game to the next means that even if one game on its own would suffer from this, the relationship can continue into the next one and still continue to develop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> averts. While most romances, even ones carried over from previous games, end up in a conversation that sets the relationship basically in stone, the dialogue with them doesn't end there. Even the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreClimaxClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreClimaxClimax">Pre-Climax Climax</a> scene isn't the end of the content, unlike previous games in the series; Shepard and the LI can discuss their relationship further during the final goodbyes, and the Extended Cut added a couple of romance-related scenes to the endgame and ending (though not enough for some fans). The Citadel DLC really took it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> though, with a ton of pre-final level romance content for most characters, including dates and a party.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite markedly averted in a certain route in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em>. In Forte's route, somewhere between the three games, Tact and Forte has somehow skipped the "I love you" phase to each other (or rather, replacing it with "I got your back, you watch mine.") and went straight to a decidedly mature take of living together as adults. The second and especially the third tests their resolve of being together as a commander and a soldier in a relationship. The third game's "breaking point" event is notable in that Forte's route is the only one not featuring relationship problems with Tact as a result of said event, instead having PTSD as a central theme.

Toki and the MC are already a couple by the time the game starts, and how they met and became a couple is hardly brought up, yet their wedding is a central plotpoint (in fact it's so central that, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>, it happens five times).

This is probably because the game doesn't dance around with a whole lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> drama; Kyrie's devotion to her provides an impetus for the plot, and that feeling remains unchanged whether or not she's yet to reciprocate. Their relationship also draws humor into the story with his obvious infatuation, and in fact their becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> arguably <em>improves</em> this facet: he's lovesick throughout the game, but when she starts returning the sweet talk, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> Agan is weirded out because she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheGuys">One of the Guys</a> to him, and as Agan is the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, his reactions are amusing.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CheckPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CheckPlease">Check, Please!</a></em> averts this beautifully, with two years of intense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> culminating in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack and Bitty</span> finally getting together. Year three has their relationship on spotlight, with several heartwarming and tearjerking moments resulting from it. Some of the best chapters of the entire comic came after their relationship got serious and received the spotlight, such as the updates that focus on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack revealing about his relationship to some of his teammates and to his own parents</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3">Ménage à 3</a></em> habitually averts the trope by being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexComedy">Sex Comedy</a> much more than it's any sort of romance, whatever some fannish shippers might want. The characters get into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasLotsOfSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasLotsOfSex">relationships</a>,</em> but these are generally short-lived or incredibly unstable, and are frequently obviously bad ideas from the first; hence, they may crash and burn, or just fizzle due to bad communication. Any pairing that the shippers might suggest (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">any pairing</a></em>) can happen, but it probably won't end anything much. Even when the lead character who started the comic as a desperate virgin got laid, it involved a previously minor character, the relationship promptly crashed, and the ex-virgin didn't change much as a person. Most of the fan base accurately predicted that most of the main cast would end up in long-term relationships towards the end of the comic, with any shipping discussions to be had being predictions on what the final pairings would ultimately be, though strong bets were avoided until the the creators alerted the readers about the approaching finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/GirlsWithSlingshots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/GirlsWithSlingshots">Girls with Slingshots</a></em> has generally averted this when dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">secondary characters' relationships</a>, like Thea and Mimi, Chris and Melody, and Maureen and Jameson...etc (although probably because they did not receive as much focus as the main characters), but this was interestingly played with in its treatment of the relationship between main character, Hazel, and Zach: At first they started with tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">Unresolved Sexual Tension</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> moments, then they finally hooked up and became a couple. But problems started to arise in that Hazel received no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> whatsoever and continued to be the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">selfish</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">immature person</a>, at first this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> and for a large chunk of the webcomic's run, Zach was portrayed as the infinitely patient and perfect wish-fulfilment boyfriend who selflessly put up with a girlfriend who gave nothing back to the relationship other than sex and the sight of being drunk, this caused a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">What Does He See in Her?</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste">No Accounting for Taste</a> reactions in the readers. The author must have realized this, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">this was taken</a> to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">logical conclussion</a> when Hazel's antics pushed Zach too far and made him break up with her. The webcomic ended with Hazel and Zach settling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a> and walking together to the sunset.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> has Haley and Elan hook up in roughly the middle of the story. They occasionally drift into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a>, but that's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> or else leads into a plot point, and their relationship dynamic remains entertaining due to the contrast between Elan's stupidity and Haley's cleverness.

<ul><li> Many fans were nervous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> would be subject to this once the two leads finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">hooked up</a> in the movie and found that the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow">still had another season</a>. To their credit, the writers kept the relationship instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">copping out</a>. There are some differing opinions on how well their romance was handled(the general consensus is it was overall well handled), but most fans think it was good enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> this trope. It helps that, even as a couple, they were still written with the same dynamic as when they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>; Kim would still snark at Ron or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">glare</a> at him if he said/did something she thought was stupid, but it was balanced out with the occasional kiss or other romantic gesture.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> with Ulrich and Yumi, since they never really resolved their relationship either way; not only did they not hook up, but they never really reached the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a> stage either, meaning that their relationship was left in limbo at the end of the series.
</li><li> Look at one of the major complaints from the fandom of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, and one of the major points will Superboy and Miss Martian's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>. Come the season 2 premier, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the two have broken up, meaning the viewers will get a rinse, lather, and repeat of the previous season.</span> By season 2, their romance (and romance in general really) received much less focus thus averting much of the annoyance it caused in the previous season. Instead it was used to heighten the two's character development over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. Superboy matured much more and MM <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grew colder due to an off-screen death of her pseudo-mother, leading her to become a LOT more loose with her telepathic intrusion which is what leads to their breakup.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> does a pretty good job of averting this. The writers did establish Green Lantern and Hawkgirl's romance very early, and they keep flirting with each other and getting closer. Once they finally drop all pretense and get together, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hawkgirl's alien boyfriend shows up, she's revealed to be a traitor and while ultimately she betrays her race to save the Earth</span>, she leaves the league for a while. Once she returns, GL has moved on and is dating Vixen, but then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he travels to the future and meets his son, then realizes his son's mother is Hawkgirl.</span> GL claims he won't let fate decide for him, and prefers to let things run their course.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ne4x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ne4x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ne4x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueBeyond">Justice League Beyond</a></em> revealed that he eventually chose Vixen. But then she was subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">murdered</a> and he got back together with Hawkgirl, eventually having the child who would become Warhawk.</span>
</li><li> Averted with Steven and Connie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, though this is mainly as a result of the writers never explicitly saying what their relationship following the end of the original series <em>is</em>. She gives him a kiss on the cheek in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">Steven Universe: The Movie</a></em> before leaving for space camp, with Steven's reaction being ambiguous about whether or not it was the first time she's done that. Later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Future</a></em> has them go on a date in one episode, but once again, it's never made clear if that's their first date or not. The end of <em>Future</em> makes it clear with a casual lip lock that they're officially together by that point, however.
