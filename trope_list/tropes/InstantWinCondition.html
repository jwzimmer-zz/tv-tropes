<ul><li> The rule of standard matches in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>: Your side can be hopelessly outnumbered and in a hopeless tactical position, if you can knock out the enemy flag-tank then you automatically win. This was apparently put in in the name of fairness, so that teams who can't afford many or very good tanks (such as the protagonist's) can theoretically be able to win against wealthy teams with large numbers of powerful tanks if they can find and neutralize the flag-tank.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, it is possible to instantly win a match in the Tenkaichi Budokai if the opponent pulls out a weapon or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut">touches the ground outside of the arena</a>. The former rule was only enforced twice, to no avail, while the latter is commonly invoked throughout the series. For example, two of Goku's wins in the 23rd tournament (the Ma Junior Saga) were ring-outs: Chi-Chi, and Piccolo.
<ul><li> For a more indirect example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">Frieza</a> has a certain advantage over the heroes with which he clashes (well, aside from his other, massively unfair advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistAbilities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistAbilities">being one of the most powerful beings in the universe thanks to a mutation</a>): he can survive in a vacuum. This ability gives him an easy out to any losing fight: why slug it out with a Saiyan who's achieved legendary power when you can just blow up the planet under your feet and starve your foe of oxygen?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School Dx D</a></em>, having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMotif">Chess Motif</a> for the Ratings Games, does exactly what you'd expect - no matter the other rules of the format, taking the King results in an instant victory. It does come with a few caveats though; a devil King has to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">pretty badass to get that position</a>, some formats keeps Kings off the field unless they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiskingTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiskingTheKing">volunteer</a>, and it's demonstrated that a side that loses nearly all their pieces before managing to bag the enemy King can still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">lose points overall</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, the titular VRMMO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a> would be beaten, and all surviving players liberated, once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> was defeated. After Kirito manages to deduce that a key player in a raid group was actually the programmer responsible for trapping them in the game, said programmer offers Kirito the chance to fight him right away, since he was planning to set himself up as the final boss. Kirito defeats him and, true to the programmer's word, the game ends.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">     Board Games  </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk">Risk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Versions of the game with Mission cards allow someone to win if they accomplish all 4 of theirs, regardless of how much they're losing or someone else is winning at the "conquer the world" objective.
</li><li> In <em>Castle Risk</em>, a rather less well-known variant, each player has a capital territory ("castle"), and if you lose that, you're eliminated from the game. Doesn't matter whether or not you're actually stronger.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a>: You win by putting your opponent in checkmate, which is when the opponent's king cannot escape a threat. This wins the game even if you have two pieces left against your opponent's sixteen (though pulling <em>that</em> off would require a truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> from your opponent). And of course, there's the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool%27s_mate">Fool's Mate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: 1. f3 or f4 e6 or e5 2. g4 Qh4#. That's about as instant as chess gets!
</li><li> In <em>Zombie Plague</em>, the humans win by barricading every window and door, with no zombies in the house. 4 zombies can break down any barricade. Human victory often comes with the sealing of an unimportant window somewhere, while a fourth zombie joins the group of 3 about to break down the front door.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TwilightStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TwilightStruggle">Twilight Struggle</a></em>. Although you can crawl toward victory by being 20 points ahead of your opponent at any time, or being in the lead at the end of turn 10, there are several instant victory conditions in this Cold War board game. The first is to have total control of Europe when the Europe Scoring card is played (usually being in control of a region just gives a bundle of points - Europe is the only one with this property). Second, if DEFCON 1 (Nuclear War) is triggered on your opponent's turn, you win the game - this leads to possible 'DEFCON trap' plays which leave the opponent with no choice but lower the DEFCON from 2 to 1. The final is a single card called 'War Games', which appears during the last few turns. The player who has this card may immediately end the game, but must first give their opponent 6 points. In other words, you must be at least 7 points ahead to win with this card.
</li><li> The board game <a class="urllink" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20134">End of the Triumvirate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is designed around this trope. With three players and three completely different victory conditions, the winner is usually the one who can keep all three fronts up in the early game, then suddenly throw two of them away for the third when he knows he can win.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> themed board game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror">Arkham Horror</a></em>, there are <em>tons</em> of instant fail conditions (Doom Track fills up, Too many gates are open at once, all three acts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingInYellow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingInYellow">The King in Yellow</a></em> are performed...), and the normal ways to win are to either seal gates or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">kill the Ancient One after he awakens</a>, which is difficult for most (and <em>impossible</em> for Azathoth, since his attack is <em>Destroy the Universe</em>). If you manage to use all six elder signs on the board, even if the Ancient One would awaken the next turn, you win instantly.
<ul><li> The first big expansion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror">Dunwich Horror</a> added two missions (consisting of board location lists, where the player will have to make special sacrifices) which allowed an instant win, 'For the Greater Good' and 'Joining the Winning Team'. While usually the players win or lose together, the later card also allows it the player making the sacrifice to win alone, with everybody else losing.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original versions of <em>(The Game of) Life</em>, if you reached the Poor House with "little or no money", you could pick a number from 1 to 10 and spin the wheel, and if it landed on your number, you became a "Millionaire Tycoon" and won the game instantly.
</li><li> In the Discworld board game, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnkhMorpork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnkhMorpork">Ankh Morpork</a>, each player has a secret identity with instant win conditions depending on factors such as the property they own, how much Trouble is being caused etc. If you are Commander Vimes, all you have to concentrate on is stopping these conditions happening, as if you reach the end of the draw pile with no one else winning, you've won!
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a> game <em>The Queen's Gambit</em>, if the Naboo side gets Anakin to the Droid Control Ship, all the droids (which is almost everything the Trade Federation player has) instantly deactivate. As long as Naboo still has 3 pieces in the palace, they win.
</li><li> In <em>7 Wonders Duel</em>, a two-person spinoff of <em>7 Wonders</em>, the game normally ends when the players progress through 3 ages, and the winner is decided by total number of Victory Points accumulated in multiple ways. However, two win conditions instantly end the game: Military Supremacy (Conflict token reaches opponent's capital, signalling conquest) or Scientific Supremacy (attaining 6 of the 7 possible scientific masteries). Note that partial credit is awarded and progressing both yields immediate benefits, so it's not all-or-nothing.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ender realizes (or remembers from his time at Salamander) that he doesn't have to disable all of the opposing soldiers in order to win the Battle Room situations, like everyone had assumed — he just had to get five of <em>his</em> to the gate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">The rules are promptly changed</a>, but it does allow him to win a battle against a double-size army in entrenched defensive positions.
</li><li> This comes up again in the final training level at Command School. Ender rightfully figures that the entire enemy fleet, outnumbering his own by hundreds to one, is worthless compared to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the planet they defend</span> and instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">launches a suicidal attack to destroy that planet</span>. Snagging the fleet is just a bonus. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just as his teachers planned, as it wasn't a training.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a> short story LEPrecon, Holly plays a game of Paintball with the commander about her promotion, where the commander promised her, she would win if she managed to land a single hit on him. The game gets interrupted by the main conflict of the story, and both the reader and Root forget about it... but Holly doesn't. Once she's established that the threat is over and Root is safe, she pulls out her marker and shoots him in the chest, reminding him that the game technically never ended and he <em>did</em> promise.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>, you win if you're the last tribute alive (and if you are you're likely to stay alive, since victors are given immediate medical treatment). Haymitch managed to win his game despite basically being disemboweled when he was able to trick his opponent into throwing an axe at the force field surrounding the arena, which bounces back anything that hits it. She gets an axe to the head, giving Haymitch the victory.
</li><li> Downplayed with Quidditch in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series.
<ul><li> The Golden Snitch is worth so many points that 99% of the time, the team that catches it wins the match, making the other players a bit irrelevant except for the purpose of racking up the highest possible score. However, there are phenomenally rare occasions where a team is so badly outmatched that even the massive amount of points from a caught Golden Snitch is not enough to secure a victory, in which case catching the Snitch becomes an Instant <strong>Loss</strong> Condition for the weaker team (the match ends, and the opposing team proceeds to win because they scored more points in goals than the Snitch is worth).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bg5l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bg5l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bg5l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's also the issue that league championships are decided on the basis of total points scored in a season, rather than simply win-loss record. Thus sometimes catching the snitch too early, before the rest of the team can score enough points, will win the specific game but ruin the chances of winning the championship.</span>
</li><li> This is parodied in <em>Porry Hatter and the Stone Philosopher</em>, where Porry is being explained the rules for the even more ridiculous "footbich" by the snitch equivalent "swinch" (yes, this one can talk). Finally, when told that the team, whose Persuader can catch the "swinch", is the victor, the boy asks about the purpose of the rest of the team. The ball tells him that it's a team sport, so there have to be others. Besides, no one would go see a game about two players and a single ball.
</li><li> Also happens in the Russian knock-off <em>Tanya Grotter</em> with "dragonball" (not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">that one</a>), which involves throwing various types of balls into the mouths of dragons. One of the balls is filled with a sedative, resulting in the dragon becoming useless and the team winning. There's a flimsy explanation, pointing out that the sedative ball is extremely difficult to throw. So, naturally, this <em>extremely rare</em> occurrence happens quite a lot in the series.

Even if you're running as fast as you can with a Hunter right behind you and gaining, you still win as long as the countdown hits zero before you get tagged (and at least one player has won this way on the show).

The same applies to your opponent becoming immobilised, either by a mechanical malfunction or through its own actions (e.g. the early Razer defeat when it pinned itself to the floor with its wheels in mid-air), although it would require 30 seconds of them not moving.

The contestant correctly answered a question in a category of his choosing, and 2. His/her opponent (if they were the champion) was unable to spin a combination that would allow him/her to tie the score at $500. In early episodes, the game immediately ended without anything further needing to be done, but the aforementioned rules were added once a contestant  a champion  spun a triple joker on his first spin, meaning the opponent didn't get even a chance to play. The bonus round also awarded a contestant the prize package in question upon spinning a triple (three of any denomination).

Getting all 10 words means that enough balls will be drawn to get at least one "Lingo" (5 in a row) and win a cash jackpot. (Although winning the <em>top</em> prize requires completing the Lingo on the first draw, which is entirely up to chance.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Often occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> in missions where the objective is to hold more strategic locations than the enemy. You only need one troop to hold the location, so often the game ends up being determined by some small squad holding an objective far from the main battle.
<ul><li> Although this is more of just a win condition, not an Instant Win Condition. Completely tabling your opponent means that you win, regardless of whether the game was supposed to be about capturing objectives. If you both manage to do this to <em>each other</em> it's a draw.
</li><li> Also, a popular tactic in objective games is to have your most mobile units charge forward at the last second to contest enemy-held objectives. Since contesting an objective denies your opponent an extra point, it is possible for you to win, even if what's left of your army is about to be wiped off the table.
</li><li> Since objectives can only be held by certain types of units, another viable tactic is to simply kill off your opponent's scoring units while keeping at least one of yours alive.
</li><li> 6th Edition has introduced the Absent Forces rule — if one player has no models on the board at the end of the Game turn (rather than their own personal part of the turn), they instantly lose. Against an army that makes heavy use of Deep Striking, Outflanking or Reserves, where a random number of units will appear in the first turn, it's possible that only a small number turn up and are quickly exterminated, or — <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/277109.page">as in one very famous example<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — are prevented from entering play at all. 6th edition also now awards players bonus victory points for killing the enemy warlord, having a unit in the opponent's deployment zone, or being the first to completely destroy an enemy unit, all of which can easily tip the balance of a game.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a> can have this too, in regard to the Vampire Counts and Tomb Kings. Being undead, the army is held together by the will of its general (or Hierophant with Tomb Kings). As a result, if the general is killed, the army begins to fall apart at that exact instant and at the beginning of each turn after. As a result, if you can kill the (usually heavily guarded and well protected) general, you can gain such an absurdly huge advantage that, even if your opponent is in an amazing position, you can still win. And if the Vampire Counts or Tomb Kings player is in a poor position when the general falls, they usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">just surrender.</a>
</li><li> It doesn't matter what the scenario is, or how far behind you are, if you can kill your opponent's warcaster/warlock in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Warmachine</a> you win immediately.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has several flavors of this:
<ul><li> The concept of "racing" is when each player just attacks with their creatures and doesn't block for any number of reasons. This is usually invoked when a player has a numeric advantage over their opponent: they can do more damage per turn to their opponent than the opponent can do to them. As a result, a lot of the strategy from Magic comes from interrupting the race, with sorcery cards that change the battle conditions, instant spells that do damage outside of what's showing on the table, and enchantments that change the numbers. Racing is <em>exceedingly</em> rare, as the only time you're likely to be in a race is at the beginning of the game, when you <em>and</em> your opponent have a large number of cards in hand (and thus responses that can interrupt the race), and late in the game, when the race is likely to be short-lived (1-2 turns).
</li><li> Magic has cards that change the victory condition, allowing you to do this. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136048">There is one card that lets you win if it is the only card you have in play and you have no cards in your hand.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Play it at the last second and a curb-stomp victory for the other guy can be snatched away by non-linear planning.
</li><li> Other conditions from other cards include but are not limited to: <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29924">Having 50 or more life<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=288878">having 200 or more cards in your library<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29978">winning 10 coin flips<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=33697">controlling 20 or more creatures<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=135259">having 20 or more cards in your graveyard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109718">having a land of each basic land type and a creature of each color<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193467">having exactly 1 life remaining<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=265418">keeping a card on the board long enough to put 5 filibuster counters on it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Then there's the flip side, cards that instantly cause someone to <em>lose</em> the game. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=288992">Door to Nothingness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an example, in that it will (if you're able to satisfy its <em>very</em> high mana cost) instantly cause someone to lose the game. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=106427">Phage the Untouchable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is another example, in that if she deals combat damage to a player, they lose. There are also the creatures that give players poison counters, and if a player has 10 poison counters, they lose. Finally, a planeswalker introduced in Return to Ravnica, Vraska the Unseen's ultimate ability creates 3 1/1 assassins that, if they hit a player for damage, that player loses the game.
</li><li> Many infinite combo decks win by sacrificing large amounts of life, cards in deck, cards in hand, or cards on the board in order to set up a winning game state. The first famous (as in, dominating a full season of tournaments) combo deck, Pros-Bloom, went so far as to go down to a <strong>negative life total</strong> before fatally draining the opponent. This was only possible with the rules at the time.
</li><li> One of the early combos, the ChannelBall, is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>. If you have the following cards in your starting hand, you can win the game in your first turn: Mountain, Black Lotus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints">Channel</a> and Fireball. When performed successfully, you're left with one hitpoint.
</li><li> Another combo involved spells that you had to pay for next turn; if you didn't, you'd lose the game. The deck would play more of these than they could hope to pay for, then use the benefits of those spells to win before the next turn ever started. Similar decks would play the same spells and force <em>the opponent</em> to cast them somehow. Depending on the deck and spell, it would often be impossible for your opponent to pay the cost for even one of them, let alone many.
</li><li> Cards have actually been designed around this trope, the most explicit being <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=12970">Final Fortune<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The card's effect: "Take an extra turn after this one. At the end of that turn, you lose the game." The nearly identical card <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233303">Last Chance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has the helpful reminder text <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">"You don't lose if you've already won"</a>.
</li><li> "Decking", the original alternate win condition: If you're told to draw from an empty library, you lose. This is harder to do than getting your life to 0, though, so it's rarer to end a game by decking. Unless you've deliberately set up your deck to "mill" the opponent into submission. Cards such as <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=millstone">Millstone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=197129">Halimar Excavator<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193441">Rise of the Eldrazi's Keening Stone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and any other Ally card are all useful unless your opponent has a card that allows them to shuffle their graveyard back into their hand. (Even if they do, the original <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109694">Feldon's Cane<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has to be exiled from the game after use, and the fancy mythic rare Eldrazi that can do this for free are, well, mythic rare.)
</li><li> There's a card from <em>Innistrad</em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230788">Laboratory Maniac<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that turns the instant <em>lose</em> condition into an instant <em>win</em> condition. If you would lose the game by being "decked" with the Maniac out, you win instead.
</li><li> A rather hilarious combo uses <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=ashnod%27s+coupon">Ashnod's Coupon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a joke card that says "Target player gets you target drink. You pay any costs for the drink." to force your opponent to either surrender or give you an obscene amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> money. First you use a card to switch Ashnod's Coupon to being under your opponent's control. Then you play a card that allows you to take their turn for them. Force them to activate Ashnod's Coupon, targeting a drink you brought with you. Since it's your drink, you can name your own price for it. All you have to do is make it a price your opponent wouldn't pay.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> TCG loves this. The Cyber Dragon era of the card game consisted of gambling that your one attack would go through, and win the duel. Of course, more advanced players would only do that after getting rid of potential traps with the card Heavy Storm.
<ul><li> An interesting twist are a series of illegal cards that state that, when used to end the duel, you win not only the duel but the entire match. (typically best 2 out of 3) One of these cards was once actually legal to play; <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Victory_Dragon">Victory Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which quickly ended up being banned to the forbidden list, not because it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, mind you; because it caused nothing but ruling headaches and arguments when the opposing player would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">immediately surrender as soon as it hit the field to try and avoid the match loss.</a>
</li><li> Yu-Gi-Oh's also has cards that allow you to instantly win a game:
<ul><li> If a player has "Left Arm of the Forbidden One", "Right Arm of the Forbidden One", "Left Leg of the Forbidden One", "Right Leg of the Forbidden One" and "Exodia the Forbidden One" in their hand, they win the duel.
</li><li> Activating "Final Countdown" will cause the player who activated it to win after twenty turns.
</li><li> "Destiny Board" puts one Spirit Message onto the field at the end of your opponent's turn, and you win if you have Destiny Board and the four different Spirt Messages on the field at once.
</li><li> "Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes" wins you the game if it inflicts damage to your opponent three times.
</li><li> "Last Turn", which requires you to have 1000 or fewer Life Points to activate, allows you to pick a monster on your side of the field, wipes both players' fields and hands, then allows your opponent to Special Summon any monster from their deck to battle yours; the player who has a monster on their field at the end of the battle wins the duel.
</li><li> Sending all five pieces of Exodia to the Graveyard with the effect of "Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord" wins you the game.
</li><li> Successfully summoning "Holactie the Creator of Light", which requires you to tribute cards whose original names are "Slifer the Sky Dragon", "Obelisk the Tormentor" and "The Winged Dragon of Ra", will instantly win you the duel. Its summoning also cannot be negated.
</li><li> Successfully detaching all of "Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo"'s Xyz Materials with its effect (by skipping your battle phase and not having any cards in your spell and trap zone) causes you to win the game.
</li><li> If "Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo" has no Xyz Materials and your opponent has 2000 or less Life Points, you win the duel.
</li><li> If three copies of "Jackpot 7" are banished by being sent to the Graveyard by an opponent's card effect, you win the duel.
</li><li> If "Ghostrick Angel of Mischief" has ten or more Xyz Materials, you win the duel.
</li><li> If a "Phantasm Spiral Dragon" targeted by "Phantasm Spiral Assault" and equipped with three different Equip Spells destroys three of your opponent's Effect Monsters, you win the duel.
</li><li> "Flying Elephant" can prevent its destruction by a card effect once per turn, and if inflicts damage with a direct attack the turn after activating its effect, you win the duel.
</li><li> If you banish three F.A. Field Spells with the effect of "F.A. Winners", you win the duel.
</li><li> If you Tribute Summon "Exodia, Master of the Guard" using five monsters, and then have it destroy an opponent's Dark Fiend monster, you win the duel.
</li></ul></li><li> "Relay Soul" gives your <em>opponent</em> an Instant-Win Condition, allowing you to Special Summon any monster from your hand or deck and protecting you from damage while its on the field, but making your opponent win the game if they manage to remove that monster.
</li><li> There are a number of monsters, which, if they win the duel with a direct attack, win you the entire match if played in a tournament (which are normally played as best-of-three). The first one, "Victory Dragon", is currently banned while the <a class="urllink" href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Match_winner">rest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have a stipulation banning their use in official duels and are generally given out as tournament prizes.
</li><li> Win conditions also must actually successfully resolve to actually win you the duel - for example, activate Ring of Destruction when your opponent gets the last piece of Exodia or "Spirit Message - L", knock their Life Points to 0, and you win instead because chains resolve in reverse of the cards being activated. So your effect happens first, unless they can stop it.
</li><li> There are also many decks based on stalling until the right cards are available in your hand for a sudden and usually completely unexpected turnaround win in one turn. An example of this is the "Armed Samurai Ben Kei" deck based on amassing field clearers like "Heavy Storm", "Giant Trunade", and "Dark Hole" as well as enough equip cards to reduce the opponent's life points by at least 8000 in one turn while exposed. Variations with other cards capable of this damage exist.
</li><li> There are many cards in the game that give you benefits at the cost of letting your opponent draw cards. This is normally a bad thing but some players, knowing that if your deck runs dry and at <em>any</em> point you are unable to draw you instantly lose the duel, build decks stacked with these cards and use the intended benefits to merely hold off and restrict their opponent until his resources run dry. Such things are now known officially as "<a class="urllink" href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mill_Deck">Mill Decks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" and now have cards <em>deliberately</em> made for this specific purpose that simply let your opponent draw cards with no benefit to you at all and would be entirely useless in any other kind of deck like <a class="urllink" href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gift_of_Greed">The Gift of Greed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In many CCG, you can cause a player to lose by fixing it so that they run out of cards in their deck before you do; if it's their turn to draw, and they can't draw any cards due to there being none left, they lose, no matter how far ahead they were at the time. This is referred to as "milling" in card game parlance (after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> card that reduced the enemy's library, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370737">Millstone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). An exception to these is Magi-nation, where, due to the nature of the game, games can last a very long time indeed, the rules indicate that when you run out of cards in your deck, you shuffle your discard pile, and set it as your deck. The only way to win is to have the opposing Magi hit 0 energy without any creatures on the field, so it's entirely possible for both players to lose if they aren't careful.
</li><li> Milling was used to great effect with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Durant</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Trading Card Game</em>, who has one very inexpensive move that forces the opponent to discard cards equal to the number of Durant on the player's side. It became enough of a problem that the card designers created a card designed specifically to get rid of Durant.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lost_World_%28Call_of_Legends_81%29">Lost World<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> provides a victory if the opponent has 6 or more Pokémon in the Lost Zone (a super-discard area used in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a> era). This is not as difficult as it sounds: <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gengar_%28Triumphant_94%29">Gengar's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Catastrophe" effect sent knocked out Pokémon to the Lost Zone instead of the normal discard pile, and an evolved Pokémon sent there will also send all of its previous evolutionary forms there too. This meant that the player only needed as few as 2 knockouts to win the game using Gengar and Lost World.
</li><li> An early form of milling in the Pokémon Trading Card Game involved abusing the original Mewtwo, which could become completely invincible for a turn by discarding a Psychic Energy. Thus, people made decks out of a Mewtwo, a trainer card that reshuffles their discard pile into the library, and 58 energies, and then simply waited for the other player to run out of cards. Under the original rules, if you mulliganed because you didn't draw any Basic Pokémon, your opponent was <em>forced</em> to draw another card, inevitably giving the deck a head start (and, on rare occasions, the win!) before the game even started. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Which is why the draw is now optional.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Milling is inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicCardGame">Epic Card Game</a></em> - if the player runs out of cards to draw, they win the game. To prevent this from becoming too easy, the game can return cards to the bottom of the deck.
</li><li> The opposing sides in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a></em> are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">Keystone Armies</a>, and a player wins if they manage to trap the opposing player's King in a checkmate, regardless of how many pieces either side still has.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chrononauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chrononauts">Chrononauts</a></em> has three separate ways to win: alter the timeline in the right ways, fulfill your mission by collecting a certain combination of three artifacts, or have ten cards in your hand at the end of your turn.
</li><li> <em>Fluxx</em> can have up to two victory conditions, depending on the cards in play, and they may or may not be mutually exclusive. Sold separately are packs of blank cards that allow people to make up cards which could do this. The most common way to win is actually to play a victory condition which you currently meet.
</li><li> <em>We Didn't Playtest This At All</em>. Here are a few ways you can win by playing a single card: Being the only girl, being the only one without points, having an even number of players in the game, having five or more cards, owning a pony... The game works by stint of it being possible for anyone to win at any time, and all players accepting that the game will, probably, only take a few minutes to play.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> collectible card game, <em>Middle Earth</em>. You win by having the most points after a certain amount of time - but if you manage to destroy The One Ring, you win immediately, regardless of score. In the games based on the films, as long as your ringbearer survives all skirmishes at site 9, you win, even if he's an inch from death and the rest of the fellowship died turns ago.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em> CCG was made of this trope. There were three default victory conditions: Military (wipe out your opponent's, either by destroying their 4 provinces or reducing them to -20 Honor), Honor (reach 40 Honor points), or Enlightenment (play all 5 elemental rings). Some VERY successful decks were designed around making a suicidal dash for max honor or enlightenment while paying just enough attention to the opponent's attacks to not be <em>completely</em> wiped out before winning. Not all of these were <em>instant</em> win conditions (Honor, for example, would only resolve if you had 40 Honor at the <em>start</em> of your turn, giving your opponent a last chance to respond, unless you used the Naga personality Dashmar to win by Honor immediately) but they would bypass the usual "kill all opponents" condition which is the usual default for CCGs. L5R would also often add new gimmicky victory conditions in expansions, such as opening enough of the 12 Black Scrolls either before (7) or after (12) the event The Darkest Magics comes up to revive the Dark God Fu Leng, or seizing control of (playing) all 4 Walls of Otosan Uchi before the event The 38th Hantei Falls comes up to effect a coup. The most notorious was <a class="urllink" href="http://l5rshop.com/zencotw/zen.zcotw~7.161.shtml">Master of Five<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a victory condition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">so nauseatingly easy to accomplish</a> (after the event in question resolves all you had to do was generate one elemental effect of each of the five elements on the same turn to win at the start of your next one) that it was generally considered a mistake that should never be repeated (the gimmick victory conditions were not meant to be seriously competitively viable).
<div class="indent"><strong>Zen Faulkes:</strong> But look at the easiest way to earn a Master of Five victory. It's a showmanlike production of useless and downright self-destructive effects. It requires no interaction with another player, other than keeping them off your back while you set your trick up. It necessarily takes a turn longer than Enlightenment does, and fears the Dharma most of all. The Master of Five is certainly a fun, challenging, and competitive deck type to play. But in terms of the story, I can't help but think that this approach to the Elements can lead nowhere good...
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEyeOfJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEyeOfJudgment">The Eye Of Judgment</a></em> has this built into the core rules. First person to get 5 creatures onto the field wins, period. So theoretically, you can win just by summoning weak weenie monsters onto the field, who can't even fight, as long as your opponent can't get rid of them fast enough. Or your opponent can have some super high cost death machine on the field and be ready to destroy your mons, but if you slam a 5th mon on the field, you win, period.
<ul><li> Of course, there are numerous ways to prevent such a strategy built into the rules. Monsters can't attack the turn they're summoned, and only deal damage first with a specific ability when attacked (if they're attacked first and wiped out, they don't get to counterattack, obviously), so summoning a weak monster in an indefensible position will get them killed. In addition, it costs mana to summon, attack and <em>turn</em> monsters (they can only attack in specific directions), and if you turn, you can't attack. The layers of strategy that go into a three-by-three board where the <em>only</em> requirement is getting five monsters on the board is immense.
</li></ul></li><li> Getting a rabbit to the back rank (or finishing the last of your opponent's) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Arimaa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Arimaa">Arimaa</a> does this.
</li><li> Pops up in official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> adventures from time to time; any group of adventurers worth their salt that ends up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a> situation should immediately begin looking for the leader of a group (without which they'll break and run); the source of power; or the secret compartment leading to their goal. Of course this is usually up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero">GM discretion</a>: the rules might *say* that an enemy force will break and run if more than 50% of their troops are killed, but if that number only gets to 51% because the pacifist cleric broke his vow and scored a critical hit while having 5 HP and defending the fallen bodies of his comrades, well, even kobolds aren't that dumb.
</li><li> There are several alien powers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CosmicEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CosmicEncounter">Cosmic Encounter</a></em> that allow for new win conditions. Notable are the Masochist (win by having all your ships die), Sadist (win by destroying enough of your opponents' ships), Tick-Tock (win by having enough time pass) and Genius (win by having 20 cards in your hand). All of them can win by the standard method also, but they generally have no useful ability in game.
</li><li> Dwarfstar's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BarbarianPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BarbarianPrince">Barbarian Prince</a></em> solo programmed adventure. The main victory condition is to acquire 500 gold pieces in 70 turns. However, the game provides a number of possible ways to achieve instant victory, such as (for example) getting across a certain river or gaining control of a particular castle.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> Customizable Card Game</em> by Decipher has a card called Writ of Accountability, which, if activated, forces an instant <em>lose</em> condition on any opponent who pursued any number of broken strategies. Since nearly all games (including all official tournament formats) are between two players, this is an instant win for the player who activates it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CerberusEngineGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CerberusEngineGames">DC Comics Deck-Building Game</a></em>, playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GLGreenLanternCorps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GLGreenLanternCorps">Kyle Rayner</a> from the <em>Crisis 2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a></em> on the same turn as 3 different Power Rings (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomizedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomizedDamageAttack">original</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">Green</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">White, Black</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Villain</a> of the same name) yields an instant victory. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto">Naruto</a> Shippuden DBG</em>, having Zabuza and letting the Main Deck run out instead of someone defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Tobi</a> also results in an instant win.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em> has the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>-related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a> version, but two of the villains stand out:
<ul><li> Wager Master is <em>notorious</em> for this trope. Plenty of his cards are "conditions", which will end the game instantly if fulfilled (in your favor or his, but the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">another trope</a>). For example, one card states the Heroes win if they all have an even number of HP that isn't their maximum at the end of the Villain turn; if this gets played during Wager Master's setup and his other cards strike the heroes just right, the game can be over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">before a single player acts</a>. And this is just one way battles with Wager Master can be over in a hurry.
</li><li> Kaargra Warfang isn't as bad, but her favor pool mechanics, cards like "Fickle Fans", and the "The heroes cannot win" rider on her flip side mean a dire situation can result in Hero victory, or dominant play from the Heroes can be stalled out into a sudden defeat, with only so much that can be done about it.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a> Trading Card Game</em> has two standard win conditions: either deal your opponent seven damage or deplete your opponent's deck. Right now, there is one alternate win condition. Sin has a Special Ability called Giga-Graviton. Discarding a Sin card in your hand and paying 9 Crystal Points activates the ability: if Sin is still on the board at the end of your next turn, your opponent loses. Since this is a 1v1 game, the player who activates it and is able to keep Sin on the board at the end of their next turn instantly wins. It's also a nice reference since in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">the source game</a>, if Sin fires it off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">you're loading up your most recent save.</a>
</li><li> The card game <em>Space Base</em> has a ship whose power is to give the owner an instant win. However, activating this power requires accumulating three to five (depending on the number of players) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">charges</a>, each of which is gained on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">a roll of 12 on two six-sided dice</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Highlander">Highlander</a>: The Trading Card Game</em>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationRequired">decapitation is required</a> to kill Immortals, cards that are "Head Shots" are included. If play a Head Shot and your opponent has (or can exert for) no defense to block or dodge it, they lose their head and the game. While this is easiest if you've whittled down your opponent a bit (or set up one of the rare and generally difficult unblockable/undodgeable head shot combos), it's entirely possible, if your opponent got very unlucky with their shuffle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">to take their head with your first attack.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MuffinTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MuffinTime">Muffin Time</a></em>, befitting the chaos of its inspiration <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ASDFMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ASDFMovie">ASDF Movie</a></em> has a few cards that let players win the game instantly but either at risk of another player stealing the victory or if it's your birthday. So if the birthday boy/girl suggests the game, watch out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodOnTheClockTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodOnTheClockTower">Blood On The Clock Tower</a></em>: Very common in the social deduction game Blood on the Clocktower, both for the good and evil team. It's complicatd by the fact that winning in such a way will often require careful planning/good bluffing. Starting from Trouble Brewing:
<ul><li> The Good Mayor: If only 3 players live (including you) &amp; no execution occurs, your team wins.
</li><li> The Good Saint: If you die by execution, your team loses.
</li><li> The Evil Mastermind: If the Demon dies by execution, play for 1 more day. If a player is then executed, their team loses.
</li><li> The Good Klutz: When you learn that you died, publicly choose 1 alive player: if they are evil, your team loses.
</li><li> The Evil Twin: You &amp; an opposing player know each other. If the good player is executed, evil wins. Good can't win if you both live.
</li><li> If nobody is executed during the day while a Vortox is in play, the good team immediately loses

<ul><li> In many video games, win conditions are dependant on players moving past certain areas, collecting certain objects, or killing certain characters. The game usually does not care if you didn't complete all the events the player was supposed to do first. For example, if a door blocking the exit of the level only opens after all the enemies are defeated, the game will still allow the player to exit the level if they find some glitch that allows them to phase through the door. Any percent speed-runners use glitches and exploits to skip as much of the game as possible to get to the "win the game" condition as fast as possible.
</li><li> This trope sees abundant use in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> series.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">The Lost Levels</a></em>, jumping behind Bowser and touching the axe destroys the bridge and sends him tumbling into the lava pit below. Basically, if you reach Bowser with a Mushroom or Fire Flower, you've already won, as you can just take a hit and then use your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> to run right past him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, clearing a stage will usually cause all remaining foes on screen to spontaneously transform into coins. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> does this only when the boss of the current world is defeated. The remaining games merely turn the enemies into earned points when the flagpole is touched, though if enough of them are gathered at once, they will turn into extra lives.
</li><li> In the 3D games, no matter the situation, as long as you get to the Star, Shine Sprite or flagpole without dying, you're fine. It doesn't matter if in the middle of an island sinking into lava, the bottom of the ocean with hardly any oxygen, or in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em>, doing a victory dance on a bottomless pit/the middle of the sky<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20s73');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20s73" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20s73');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this one was changed in the remake</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em> takes this to the extreme. Many of the Green Stars actually require you to <em>leap to your death</em>. As long as you can manage to collide with the star along the way, you're golden.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KaizoMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KaizoMarioWorld">Kaizo Mario World</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">Kaizo Trap</a>, goes out of its way to avert this trope. Unless you've taken care to cover the pit beyond the finish line, grabbing the flag will cause Mario to happily walk to his death.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> games, you can still win in many situations even if you're careening towards certain doom so long as your enemy does so first.
<ul><li> One method that invokes this same technicality is to swallow the last enemy as Kirby and fall off the side. For some reason, the enemy in Kirby's belly will count as having been defeated first, leading to an instant win with Kirby some minuscule distance away from his own death. His "throw" moves work similarly.
</li><li> Bowser does it better. He can grab an enemy and body slam them into the floor. If you move in midair to over a pit during this attack, Bowser can end up pulling the enemy along on a suicide dive, the enemy dying a moment before Bowser.
</li><li> In the original, this bug only worked on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Metal Mario, but other enemies could be beaten using a variation.
</li><li> It can be done in some manner by DK, Diddy Kong, and Ganondorf, etc.
</li><li> In <em>Brawl</em>, a bug in the code can result in either an instant victory or Sudden Death, depending on controller order. The "Suicidal KO" rule used in tournament play fixes this.
</li><li> A situation universal to every Smash Bros. game, combination of characters, and rulesets is that if the remaining characters have all been sent flying, whoever gets KOed last wins. Thus, someone who got punted first could still win the match as long as the game has declared everyone else KOed before him or her (as the length of time between the final blow and declaration of a KO can vary depending on the stage, the direction of the launch, and the location of the final blow).
</li><li> This got particularly frustrating if both fighters were knocked off the top of the screen, which resulted in either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleInTheSky">star KO</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraAbuse">screen KO</a>. The former took twice as long as the latter, meaning whoever got sent flying first might narrowly win if they got lucky with their defeat animation. Later games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">treat the top of the screen as a normal blast line on the final stock</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>, you can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (and your rivals) simply by accomplishing a victory condition — <em>any</em> victory condition — before they do. Enemy at the gates? Get that ship to Alpha Centauri and you win. Another Civ about to colonize the stars? Stomp him flat and conquer the globe. Diplomatic and cultural victories are also possible in the later games, allowing even Civs with weak militaries and backwards technological development to come out ahead of their competition. <em>Alpha Centauri</em> also included an economic victory by cornering the global energy market. Domination victory is achieved when only one player still has their original capital, so you win if you take their capital even if the enemy has 15+ cities spitting out military units and is about to take it right back next turn.
<ul><li> Even weirder is the space race victory in the Civ I, Civ II, the Beyond the Sword expansion for Civ IV, and Civ Rev. You win when the spaceship <em>reaches</em> Alpha Centauri (not just when you launch it). If your opponents wipe you off the map in the time it takes to get there, you still lose, even though your colonists will still arrive at Alpha Centauri. Or conversely, if your opponent has already launched the spaceship, killing <em>him</em> quickly (nukes are your friend there) will stop him from winning. In some cases you may be able to complete a faster spaceship, and beat him there.
</li><li> It can get even more absurd, but not less fun, in the mod <em>Rhye's and Fall of Civilization</em>, which focuses on accomplishing specific historical goals, quite a few of which involving building something or researching a specific technology. For instance, as the Mayans, the Aztecs and Europeans may have reduced you to maybe five squares of Central America, but as long as you researched calendars and build the Temple of Kukulkan, you'll automatically win if you live to 1745.
</li><li> Civ IV's cultural victory conditions are a great example of this trope. A strong alliance can burn all but three of your cities to flames (and be about to take care of the last three), but if you can reach "Legendary" culture levels in those three cities, instant win.
</li><li> <em>Civilization VI</em> took steps to at least tone this down, making it easier to see the end coming in time to do something about it. Domination was carefully reworded to require the one civ to control every opponent's capital simultaneously. The Space Race now involves three separate phases, and every player is notified when a phase is completed (after all, a space launch is difficult to miss). Culture and Religion victories are the result of a gradual spread, with ways to undermine the leaders or defend yourself as long as you're paying attention. That said, the finish line is ultimately crossed with a single action in every case.
<ul><li> On the other hand, <em>VI</em> had the AI tweaked so that other Civs will likely declare war on you when you're about to win, which can highlight the oddity more when you launch the mission to Mars while the enemy is about to smash your spaceport to bits.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a></em>, it's even more prevalent. The Domination victory has remained unchanged, but the other four victories all involve going through several steps and building a giant, destructible, wonder on a tile near your city. Every player in the game is informed of every other player's progress, so pretty much every game can end with every player making a rush to assault the player who made the most progress towards victory.
</li><li> In the <em>Alien Crossfire</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em>, the Progenitor factions have an additional victory option, if they manage to build and power a certain number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">Subspace Ansibles</a> for a specific number of turns, they will send a signal to their homeworld and summon their entire fleet. Presumably, the fleet then wipes every other faction off the face of Planet.
</li></ul></li><li> A common case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em>, where the default victory condition is 'assassination'. If you kill your opponent's Armored Command Unit, they're wiped out. Many games are ended by a single large wing of strategic bombers punching through a layered defense, or a single nuke, aimed to take out a single unit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em>. In the campaign and the default multiplayer settings destroying a faction's Commander would instantly <em>detonate</em> every single one of their units and structures- effectively a shortcut to the more plausible 'destroy all enemies'.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters">Freedom Fighters</a></em>, a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a> can immediately be reversed as long as you can raise the American flag at the end of the level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sometimes, the objective for an Arcarum map will be written as "None", allowing you to freely explore the nodes or simply move to the next map.
</li><li> In some scripted event and story battles, reaching a certain number of turns will automatically end the fight and proceed with the next episode of the chapter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Your Wanted level will be reduced to zero immediately upon finishing many missions. This can lead to a case where you have a dozen police cars surrounding you as you reach your objective, then all of them decide "Oh, he won. Let's go get some coffee."
</li><li> Also works by going into a Pay 'N Spray, even when the damn Army is chasing you (unless you have a vehicle they won't touch, or there is an APB on the mission vehicle). You'd almost think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Chief Wiggum</a> was leading the police in those games.
</li><li> And then you have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoChinatownWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoChinatownWars">Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars</a></em>, while Pay 'N' Spray will remove your wanted level with a fresh coat of paint, they'll outright <em>refuse</em> to do so while there are any active cops or police cruisers in the vicinity. Police cruisers make up about a third of the traffic on <em>Chinatown Wars</em> take of Liberty City, and your chances of actually getting anywhere near a Pay 'N' Spray without cops trying to ram you off the road approach practically zero. Still, heat magically disappears if you trigger a mission, complete a mission, or walk into your safehouse and rest for six hours <em>even in full view of the police,</em> as it has from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>.

<ul><li> The Saints stores in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em>. You walk into a store and instantly your wanted level disappears. Why? Because your (invisible) boys are guarding the store and it is Saints territory. Which is enough to scare off tanks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APCs">APCs</a> sent by someone who openly declared war on you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV">Saints Row IV</a></em>, you can't lose your wanted level by hiding in your cribs anymore: Zinyak had the foresight to remove them from the virtual recreation of Steelport. On the other hand, when you become wanted, a Golden CID appears. Chasing it down and destroying it will instantly remove your wanted level and send any police or Zin attacking you away. Same for if you max out your wanted level and subsequently destroy the Warden.
</li></ul></li><li> Has been known to happen in Double Conquest maps in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142">Battlefield 2142</a>.</em> One team will have the other down to only a few tickets until defeat while still having over a hundred left themselves, when a sudden strike from behind sweeps across the field capturing all their spawn points and wiping them out. Without anywhere to spawn, all those tickets are worth NOTHING. (Of course, this is very rare as a team which ends up that far behind on tickets most likely lacks the coordination to mount this kind of counterattack.)
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> series (and many similar games), many missions just involve getting to a particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. Once you're actually at it, even if half the enemy army is about to converge at your position in what will surely be a one-sided victory for them, the mission ends and you miraculously escape off-camera. Except for that one mission in the first game where you have to escape with it: Nod mission 6.
<ul><li> This ends in tragedy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</a></em>, where lose conditions are checked even after the victory banner is shown; one Allied mission requires using Tanya to destroy a few key buildings in a Soviet base, and Tanya can be overrun and killed if you complete your objective without clearing out the enemies (especially attack dogs) nearby — the victory banner is shown and cheering starts, then Tanya dies and the Mission Failed banner appears over the victory banner and you must start the mission over.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outpost2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outpost2">Outpost 2</a></em>, every mission is a race against time. If you're playing as Eden, the bacterial nightmare called the Blight encroaches on the map and starts destroying your base, consuming it entirely if you dawdle, resulting in an automatic mission failure. Plymouth faces a similar threat from volcanic activity: If you take too long, you'll get swamped by lava. The thing is, even if the Blight or the lava is just a tile or two away from your Command Center, if you can otherwise fulfill the mission conditions, your colonists are all packed up and ready to escape before the disaster consumes everything. There is a constant requirement across all base building missions in the <em>Outpost 2</em> campaign is to be sure you have enough evacuation transports constructed for your current population, and have materials for the new colony already loaded into trucks and ready to leave at a moment's notice. If this isn't the case, either by not building them or the transports somehow getting destroyed, victory <em>will not</em> occur. Indeed, in the closing missions, you're reminded to keep your population at a steady figure, too, lest people be left behind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not to mention, a big part of one mission is a non-optional mercy objective to kidnap/rescue the enemy's children, since you're leaving behind the other colony to die.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series has the seldom seen "Stage Clear" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects">Geo Effect</a>, which does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a> (though you have to end your turn first). There are also two Instant <em>Lose</em> Conditions, the "Game Over" Geo Effect (that, naturally, the enemy AI <em>will</em> make a beeline towards) and, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2">Disgaea 2</a></em>, the "Game Over Dark Sun effect.

One particular mission does it <em>twice</em>.
</li><li> Many battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> just require defeating one specific enemy. If you can do that, even if you're down to your last man and the next enemy barrage will definitely kill him, you automatically win.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em> you have to follow the judge's rule for the match to get bonuses and sometimes to win at all, but since it doesn't acknowledge a law being broken until the turn it was broken on ends you can break the law without penalty as long as you end the fight on that turn. The game also has multiple kinds of win conditions, depending on the battle. Some fights force you to endure waves of enemies for certain amount of rounds while others require you to weaken a specific enemy. Satisfying the win condition is all you need to do and nothing else matters.
</li><li> In all three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc">Luminous Arc</a></em> games, where defeating XXX is enough to grant you the victory even if you have just one party member left. In two late-game boss battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc3">Luminous Arc 3</a></em>, however, defeating the target without defeating a certain other enemy/enemies on the battlefield would lock you out of the good ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations">Rise of Nations</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game declared victory if you were holding enough territory. So, even if there was all-out war and the balance of power was constantly shifting, if you could keep just enough land for a few minutes (or had the Wonder building that meant instant assimilation), you won immediately.
</li><li> If you have the "World Government" (at the end of the Civics tree) tech online, you can skip the several minutes of waiting, bomb a few convenient targets, and then snatch them. World Gov skips the timers entirely.
</li><li> Or if you build enough Wonders to get enough Wonder Points. Apparently you can conquer the world with art.
</li><li> In the Conquer the World campaigns you can purchase a territory adjacent to another nation's capital which grants you an army, then attack the capital immediately afterwards. If you win, you get the money back and every territory that nation had before you do this!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> Seize missions have the objective of capturing the throne. If you do this, the level is cleared and all the enemies that might have been chasing you will just decide you aren't worth the trouble any more. Smart players will kill everyone for the EXP first, though.
</li><li> "Defeat Boss" missions end the moment the boss's HP hits 0. Great for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun">speed runs</a>.
<ul><li> This one is actually justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Fire Emblem Gaiden</a></em>'s fight against Rudolf. He explicitly orders his troops to surrender if he is killed by Alm and the Deliverance.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there are the "Defend the Throne/NPC" missions, off course when the designated amount of turns over a handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt">Redshirts</a> appear and scare the enemy off. In many of these missions, should the player manage to defeat the Boss(es) of the map and/or rout the entire field, the player automatically wins and the mission ends, even if this particular condition wasn't mentioned. It's still smarter to let the turns run out and milk the mooks for EXP, gold, and items though.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, if one of your characters has taken "mortal damage", you still have a chance to finish the battle before he collapses. In fact, <em>all</em> damage to your characters is applied by having your HP steadily decrease, and the higher your "guts" value, the slower it goes. Which is quite handy when one of the enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">explodes on death</a>: you'd better kill him last.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Aside from the HQ Capture method of victory (particularly important in AW1's "Advanced Campaign", where the enemy have overwhelming numbers and you're basically using all your units as sacrifices and bodyguards for one Infantry-loaded APC), many, many campaign missions from <em>Black Hole Rising</em> onwards have you winning by destroying the enemy's superweapon <em>du jour</em> (unit-spawning factories, big cannons, thing that heals a lot of units at once, sometimes all three), causing them to retreat and giving you victory <em>even when their conventional forces overwhelm you</em>.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em>Sinking Feeling</em> where your instant-win condition is to sink 9 enemy battleships before they are repaired. After you manage to sink them, the enemy CO Lash goes ballistic and sics every unit she has on your troops to wipe them out as payback, only to find out that your troops decided they'd achieved their mission and <em>retreated</em>:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Lash:</strong> What else is there to do now?! We attack with all our strength! They've made me mad and now they're gonna pay big time!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Black Hole Soldier:</strong> Mistress Lash? The enemy left. It seems they've done what they set out to do and left.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Lash:</strong> You've got to be joking! They just sank my boats and took off? I... AM... SO... ANGRY!!!
</div></li><li> Capturing an enemy's HQ is also an instant <em>defeat</em> condition in a three- or four-way battle; it results in all their units being destroyed, no matter how many they had before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattalionWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattalionWars">Battalion Wars</a></em> was pretty fond of it too. Certain levels basically end in the player trying to buy enough time to raise a flag.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> has this in the "Control Area" and "Take and Hold" victory conditions. The former involves holding over two-thirds of the Strategic Points, while the latter involves holding half of the harder-to-defend Critical Locations, but in both cases the idea is the same - if the timer runs down to zero, victory is achieved regardless of who has the bigger and stronger army.
</li><li> The reverse is possible in <em>Dawn of War 2.</em> While most games are based on holding points, it is possible to destroy the enemy base before the points all tick away, allowing an outmaneuvered player a (very difficult) alternate win condition. Note that it's mostly difficult because of the toughness of the bases; even with a few heavy tanks and the personification of the god of murder beating down on one, it takes nearly two minutes to destroy an undefended base, which is an eternity in a game whose rounds typically last 10 minutes or less.
</li><li> The siege of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> stronghold by the Tau in the Dark Crusade. The objective is to destroy their main Stronghold. Since the Tau Commander, if properly upgraded, is an invisible jet-packed one-man-tank, he can cut the "sieging" and "storming" parts, sneak to the enemy base and raze the building single-handedly from a vantage point (just keep in mind the map is littered with Servo Skulls, who can turn the Commander visible again). That's it. One building. And despite that the whole SM army is still intact they will let out a mighty BAWWWWWWWWWW as their Captain suddenly drops dead, admit defeat, and barrage their own positions with orbital bombing so that they don't fall in your hands. Suckers.
</li><li> The same happens when playing Necrons vs Imperial Guard or, if slightly harder to pull off, Space Marines. All you need to do is destroy the Imperial HQ, but access is blocked due to a large river. Conveniently there are some small patches of land and your Necron Lord can teleport. Better yet, he resurrects wherever he is slain and topping even that he can become an immortal Death God for a short while. So you teleport, kill the enemy HQ to death and go elsewhere to kill stuff.
</li><li> The Imperial Guard are notorious for their ability to just skip anything in a Stronghold during a campaign. They have the best artillery in the series, and they have a way to pierce the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> and upgraded Earthshaker shells that can heavily damage whatever it hits. The game even tells you exactly where the objective is on the map. All the Guard player has to do in a Stronghold is fight to within Earthshaker range, and fire the shells until the target is a smoking crater. Entire armies will rout because their main headquarters/figurehead got taken out by precision artillery from a mile away.

It does not matter how many times the enemy Heroes get killed if they succeed in bringing down your main building. Kills and gold help, but if you happen to get a carry into the enemy base while they aren't looking, good game. Balanced in that you have to destroy all buildings in at least one lane before you can kill the Throne.
</li><li> In one case, this is actually used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingThePlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingThePlayer">Playing the Player</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once you acquire Frostmourne in the final human campaign mission, insurmountable waves of enemies begin to spawn, overwhelming your base. Since it's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroMustSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroMustSurvive">&lt;Hero&gt; Must Survive</a> for Arthas, most players will just abandon the camp and have Arthas go solo the major antagonist necessary to win. It turns out that's exactly what the Lich King intended, and this time the allies stay dead and Arthas is corrupted.</span>
</li><li> Even if you have enough resources to build 100 bases consisting of all the available buildings, have enough workers to do so 10 at a time, and your army is fully teched with three Level 10 Heroes (and is unstoppable compared to the opponent's), you will lose once all buildings go down. As a result, some players mass Siege Engines or Raiders and send them to sick on the enemy's bases in an "all or nothing" attack.
</li></ul></li><li> In the SNES strategy game <em>Liberty or Death</em>, if neither the American army nor the British army defeat the other side by the year 1820, the game will end automatically with King George III's death. This means that you win automatically if you're playing as the American army (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">or instant defeat, if you're playing as the British</a>).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> series, defeating the enemy leader has this effect. Your own army can be utterly demoralized, all allied officers dead, and your commander on his last legs, but as long as the enemy commander goes down first, you score a win. Very useful if playing the commander.
<ul><li> <em>4</em>, in particular, had a number of stages that definitely qualified. The biggest ones are the Nanman Campaign, where the regenerating gates and constant morale loss mean that your side's going to get massacred in <em>very</em> short order if you don't rush to the enemy camp and put down the leader quickly, and Battle of Jian Ye, where you're required to do this <strong>four times</strong>.

<ul><li> The game has gates to the hell dimension of Oblivion opening everywhere. The Oblivion worlds are full of enemies, but the best way to win is just to make a break directly to the top of the large tower and grab the Sigil Stone. Which makes sense, because a portal to Oblivion collapses completely once its Sigil Stone is removed, and the player character and any of his or her friends will end up safely on the grass where they originally entered the portal. The daedra that were in that area of Oblivion, no longer have a means of getting from their world to ours and are thus no longer a threat.
</li><li> The final mission requires you to escort Martin Septim to the Temple of the One during a huge demonic invasion. To win, all you have to do is get <em>yourself</em> inside while Martin is alive. Even if he's a whole block behind you and surrounded by enemies, he will enter the Temple as soon as you do, triggering the ending sequence.
</li></ul></li><li> Many four and five-star "Civilian Displacement" missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>. As long as you don't stick around and fight, the baddies won't stick around, either.
</li><li> Due to the "war score" mechanic, almost every game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive">Paradox Interactive</a> makes has this to one degree or another. It doesn't matter whether or not the enemy has a force that can pummel you into the ground if brought fully to bear (or even if the majority of your army is wiped out); if you can seize an early lead in the war by taking provinces quickly, you'll often come out better off at the peace table than you were before. The later EU III versions work differently, countries consider whether they have armies left to fight. Which can lead to silly situations itself - a huge army will mean that your enemy may not surrender, even if you, e.g., control all of Spain, but Spain has still a huge army on Mallorca, though without any ships to move them.
<ul><li> Starting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a> 2</em>, warscore is calculated based on a variety of factors. Capturing an enemy province means very little if they have 60+ provinces, and beating down their 1500-man army won't even earn you a percentage point if they have a 15,000-man army heading your way. However, if that 15,000-man army is a continent away, or can't actually reach you, it won't be factored in<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3m8jh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3m8jh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3m8jh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which is important when the country you're fighting calls on allies: if it will take them quite some time to reach the battlefield, you still have a chance to win even if they control a vastly more powerful army</span>, and defeating a numerically superior force with better tactics is also worth much more warscore than just trumping the enemy with bigger numbers yourself. That being said, if you get to 100% positive or negative warscore, the war is over immediately (your opponent will offer surrender terms immediately, or immediately forces <em>you</em> to surrender). In the rare event that one side captures the enemy ruler in battle, it immediately sets the warscore to 100%, allowing them to win the war immeidately regardless of any other factors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> specifically averts this as well: if you concentrate only on stomping enemy fleets, warscore will plateau very quickly. To win a war, you have to destroy orbital stations, conquer or desolate enemy planets, and prevent them from doing the same<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note45mrk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note45mrk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note45mrk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Warscore increases based on the percentage of damage done to someone's empire as a whole. An empire with a small standing fleet but massive production capability will suffer very little from having their standing fleet destroyed, but much more from having their production base crippled through planetary invasions. The fastest way to increase warscore is always to successfully conquer planets, but for massive empires with multiple colonized planets, each individual planet has less of an effect</span>. However, if you do enough damage to get your warscore high enough to enforce your war demands (which could be anything from 1% to 100%), then the enemy will immediately surrender and declare you victorious, <em>unless</em> they have enough military might to swing the warscore back in their favor within a couple of in-game months (thus preventing a player from smashing a small patrol fleet and having the enemy surrender when the enemy still has a much bigger fleet farther from the front line). The player <em>can</em> still enforce demands, however.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> has a particularly funny example in the expansion: as an invincible Titan wreaks havoc in the nearby city, the player's forces and an ally have to survive against the Titan's offspawns and other enemies. In the end, the Titan comes for the player, likely crushing his entire base...but as long as the player fulfills the objective of bringing 3 Rocs (Egyptian Myth units that act as air transports) to the ally, everything is fine and dandy. Another example from the original campaign is a Tug of War mission. When the cart that is being fought over nears the players base, the enemy starts pumping out lots of units from his base... but they give up the second the gates close behind the cart.
</li><li> Almost literally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico">ICO</a></em>: you can try to beat the Shadows into submission with your length of wood, but bringing Yorda to the stone gates will prompt her to open them —which instantly dispels all Shadows from the area.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> games:
<ul><li> It's not always necessary to kill every last enemy to win the mission. In fact, in a few missions you get chewed out if you engage in unnecessary bloodshed. This is quite common for the strike missions, particularly against the Kilrathi starbase at the end of Wing Commander I. You can also do this in Secret Missions. Plot a course straight for the Sivar, afterburn towards it and after wasting it get out of dodge. Only need to worry about a few fighters around the Tiger Claw.
</li><li> The plot of <em>Wing Commander III</em> assigns the player to an outdated carrier taking part in various missions while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the confederation is slowly losing the war</span> and while bigger ships fight in more important battles. Cue the development of Confed Secret Projects, which can end the war instantly if they can get to the right strategic location. Naturally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final mission of the game has Commander Blair sneaking onto the Kilrath capital world with a small strike force to deliver a lethal blow and end the war that's been going on over 50 years (and 3 <em>Wing Commander</em> titles)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em>:
<ul><li> Counter-Terrorists can win a round in hostage maps by rescuing all of the living hostages on the map. The key word here is <em>living</em>. If things got hairy, you could (as a CT) rescue just one hostage (out of 4 or 5, depending on the map) and let the rest die in the crossfire (or if you are truly sadistic, off them yourself). Once that happens, the CTs will win the round for rescuing all the living hostages. Terrorist teams often counter this "strategy" by offing all of the hostages at the beginning of the round, turning the round into a deathmatch - though many servers will auto-kick players for killing too many hostages.
</li><li> In bomb defusal (DE) maps the bomb being set and going off before it can be deactivated counts as a terrorist victory even if their entire team is dead, which makes sense as the goal is to destroy what needed destroying. There's even an achievement for winning a round while your entire team is dead in <em>Source</em> and <em>Global Offensive</em>. Conversely, the CTs automatically win, no matter how many enemies are still alive or if they're the last man standing on their team, if they can disarm the bomb once it's been placed, which makes slightly less sense since there doesn't seem to be anything stopping the Terrorists from just killing the rest of the CTs and re-arming the bomb.
</li><li> CTs will win the round if the Terrorists fail to plant the bomb in time. Terrorists can have all five members alive and control of the bomb site, the bomb can be a fraction of a second away from being armed, but as long as one CT is alive, even if they are on the other side of the map or not even at their keyboard, the CTs win. It's not like the CTs failing to defuse in time where the bomb will detonate - if the bomb is armed just a tenth of a second later, what does it matter? The arbitrary timer results in a loss. The bomb will even arm <em>after</em> time if it's close enough, but the CTs already won by having their last man run and hide.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has this as a standard for most boss encounters. It doesn't matter how many adds he has active, how much of the room is on fire, or how many of you have been turned in his mindless, twisted slaves - so long as the boss dies, you win.
<ul><li> In the Halls of Stones instance, there is a gauntlet called the Tribunal of Ages, where you have to protect Brann Bronzebeard from getting roflstomped by mecha-dwarves as he's tinkering away at the security system. You have to live for 5-7 minutes of constant mobs, that spawn faster and faster and even avoid huge purple bombs of pain and a laser beam. When all of these at once, you can be seconds from achieving victory, have all of your party members die, and yet you still win if Brann manages to subdue the security system and use them to destroy the mecha-dwarves.
</li><li> Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest battlegrounds may also count. The enemy might be swarming your base, attacking your general, but as long as your team manages to kill their general even a split second before yours dies, you win.
</li><li> There's also Wintergrasp, where every 2.5 hours the attacking team has 30 minutes to storm the defenders' keep at the north end of the zone. If the attackers break through the three layers of walls and reach the sphere at the center within the time limit, they instantly win. But at the south end of the zone are three towers; if the defenders destroy all of them, they gain a hefty damage boost and 10 minutes are shaved off the attackers' clock. If there are less than ten minutes left, the defenders get an Instant Win.
</li><li> Hellfire Assault involves stealing ammo to fire cannons at a fortified gate. So long as you can get enough ammo into the cannons to fire, it doesn't matter if only one person is alive being chased by dozens of enemies - you win.
</li></ul></li><li> Before they were patched out, there were a few ways to get out of bound or otherwise bypass the gates in the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a></em>, and then flee for the exit, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_AF57YdRh8">which has been abused mercilessly in at least one speedrun.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a></em> has this in spades. For the most part, it doesn't matter at all if you're detected, as long as you get your ass to the checkpoint, you win. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em> avoid this by turning off the end-of-level checkpoints during Combat Alert, forcing you to hide if there are still enemies pursuing you; though, in the case of <em>MGSV</em>, getting far enough away from an outpost can instantly end a Combat Alert, and that's usually where you need to be to clear the mission anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2">Mega Man X2</a></em>, the battle with Agile takes place in a room with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a> in the bottom, but if you kill him while in midair on top of them, you won't die when you fall on top of them afterwards. This is the easiest to accomplish by performing a Shoryuken on him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">Mega Man X1</a></em> has a boss with a spike pit at the bottom, but in that case, the spikes instantly crumbled as soon as you dealt the final blow. This boss returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em> but now projects <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> spikes that shut down when you defeat it.
</li><li> A minor variation occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a></em> games: When the last enemy on the battlefield is defeated, you lose control of Mega Man during the victory fanfare and are invincible during that time, even if a time bomb explodes a split-second after the last enemy is taken out. Up through <em>Star Force 2</em>, projectiles and bombs would remain on the battlefield in the background of the victory screen, but you'd still be immune to them. However, winning a battle by the skin of your teeth reduces your reward for victory, and in extreme cases will replace your reward with a mercy HP refill.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> games, draining a boss's health enough to make her move onto her next attack pattern will cause all bullets from the current attack to turn into items. The same applies to all on-screen enemy bullets upon reaching a boss. Earlier games would also give you a brief moment of invincibility during the explosion animation at the end of each boss's last Spell Card, though this was removed starting with <em>Mountain of Faith</em>, making it possible <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9lSSLOLdRA">to die after beating the final boss<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> uses this.
<ul><li> Most missions are won if you seize the enemy's main base. A fun strategy is just running a scout into the base, grenading any troops there, and winning, regardless of the (likely rather poor) tactical situation the rest of your army is in. The game practically <em>encourages</em> this, since the <em>only</em> factor affecting your end of mission rating is how quickly you won- kills, casualties, nothing else has any relevance to your score.
</li><li> Any and all 'defeat enemy commander' missions. Useful in the games where you can kill Aces to claim their bonuses (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a> weapons) and get the mission done as soon as possible to save time.

The quickest strategy of completing Mandate of Heaven in <em>Heroes of Might and Magic III</em> is to take Castle Darkmoor, build it up as a Necropolis town, leave after getting a sufficiently large army and before the other factions take an interest in capturing it, then head to capture the Hive before the 7-day deadline results in game over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em> if you die after activating the Scoreboard (like say, the level creator decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">place a Trigger Explosive right under the Scoreboard</a>, connected to a Proximity Switch so it goes boom when you step on the platform), you won't lose the game even if you were on your last life.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleStations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleStations">Battle Stations</a> Clan war, no matter how many members of the opposing team are able and willing to fight or how many defenders you've overrun, the battle is won when one side's fort is sunk.

<ul><li> Killing a faction's leader unit instantly defeats them. Many single player missions can be completed extremely quickly, simply by slapping haste on a powerful unit and rushing them to the enemy leader, completely bypassing the entire map covered in enemy units. On the other hand, it also makes it ridiculously easy to lose if you aren't careful with your own leader.
</li><li> In <em>Age of Wonders 2</em> Wizards can respawn, so this must be repeated as many times as player has Wizard Towers. If you're threatened, it may give even greater incentive to build them than the main function (magical relay).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series has various missions where you need to gain a minimum number of points by destroying targets within the time limit. As long as you made the point limit, you could just survive till the time ran out and the mission would be accomplished... if there is no "Mission Update". Some other missions you could just go for the targets and ignore the other enemies to immediately win. Amusingly, a bug in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em> sometimes causes the AI to realize how silly this is and continue attacking you after the mission has ended, even while you're unable to target or track them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</a></em>, as soon as you destroy the last mission objective, all the other enemy forces instantly disappear. Most other games just have them stop targeting you once the mission is over, though sometimes they glitch out and you have to keep avoiding missiles.
</li><li> There's a brief period of time between "Mission Accomplished" and actually completing the mission to be taken to the results screen, and during this time you can still crash into things and fail the mission. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirCombat">The original game</a> avoided this by taking control away and forcing the player to pull up into the air, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat2">Ace Combat 2</a></em> didn't; however, a mission accomplished was still a mission accomplished even if you crashed after control was taken away from you, and the only cost was a deduction from your cash to replace the plane. Missions in which a post-mission accomplished crash would be unavoidable normally, such as the obligatory canyon mission, just had the player immediately de-spawn once the final target is destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirforceDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirforceDelta">Airforce Delta</a> Strike</em> has several of these.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the final moments of control point and payload matches, the pushing team is often outnumbered, surrounded, and dying left and right. But once the objective is complete, all opposing players are disarmed and fall prey to those they had been killing just seconds before. Taken to the extreme, one side could be losing the fight badly and still win if <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VafqOW_qu4E">someone sneaks by enemy lines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In fact, the Spy and Scout have achievements for doing so.
</li><li> This happens quite often on Dustbowl. The second capture point in each part falls extremely quickly to a spy or scout sneaking past the defenders if they get too bold and fight too far away from it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOnlyHasToWinOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOnlyHasToWinOnce">Inverted</a> against the player in Mann Vs Machine mode. It doesn't matter how badly you're steamrolling the robots' spawn point, if a single Scoutbot sneaks behind you with the bomb, you're done for. The humans do still have an instant-win condition against the robots, just one that's tough to exploit. If, for example, a wave consists of 30 Soldier bots and unlimited "support" Scoutbots, killing the 30th Soldier bot causes the Scoutbots to drop dead instantly, no matter how much of the field the Scoutbots control.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em>, it is mentioned near the end of the game that Rheinland forces have pretty much obliterated most Kusari resistance and have almost conquered the House. However, once you win the game, everything returns to normal and the Rheinlanders go home. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Rheinlanders were under the control of the alien Nomads, and once the Nomads were defeated by Trent's activation of the hypergate, their control broke.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Z" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Z">Z</a></em>, the objective was to destroy the opponent's fortress by a) direct assault b) destroying all of the enemy robots or c) getting a unit inside the enemy fort. You could have a strong army and most of the map claimed, but it's all for nothing if a bunch of snipers sneak past your defenses, take out the turrets on your fort, and casually stroll in.
</li><li> In the first few missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em>, if you're playing on the easiest difficulty, the mission ends a few seconds after you finish the objectives - you don't need to escape from the place you're robbing. This has some absurd consequences: for example, in mission 3, "Down in the Bonehoard", if you time it right, you can grab the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, then jump down a very deep pit... and somehow survive, since the mission ends in victory before you can reach the bottom and die.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> games:
<ul><li> When assaulting an enemy settlement, you win by either destroying the entire enemy army or by holding the settlement's central plaza for a certain amount of time (which generally translates to having at least one of your guys within the plaza's boundaries and no enemies). Even if there's a ginormous enemy reinforcement army approaching, you will still win as long as it fails to reach the plaza in time to disrupt the timer.
</li><li> Standard battles also have timers. It is entirely possible to have a single unit of some kind left during a snow/rainstorm hide out waaaay at the corner of the map, and win due to time out. (In clear weather it's simple enough to just search the forests then the corners, but in snow/rain visibility falls to nothing and so long as you turn off the AI engagement the enemy can walk right by you and not notice you.) In campaign, this only works on defense.
</li><li> In the campaign maps, it doesn't matter if the opposing faction has several huge armies coming to curbstomp you, the minute you take out their last city they're instantly wiped out, since presumably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">they're so distraught by the loss of their leadership, they can't do much of anything, let alone reestablish the nation</a>. In some games as armies will stick around to cause misery to you, but because they have no source of income they have to act fast to regain any kind of foothold.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome: Total War</a>: Barbarian Invasion</em>, destroying a barbarian's last city will spawn several armies as the group leave in search for new lands... normally yours.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII">Total War: Warhammer II</a></em>'s Eye of the Vortex campaign. Completing the final ritual activates The Final Battle, where the other factions gang up on you - and despite the deck being stacked in your favour, this can still be a hard fight. (This battle itself is an example, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> you win by running down the clock, justified by siezing control of the Vortex and ending the battle by fiat.) Conversely, if another faction completes their ritual first, you automatically join the other factions in a last-ditch effort to break their hold on the Vortex.

Most levels are user-contributed.. and the default game rules play the trope straight.
<ul><li> Some levels play it too straight to the extent of lampshading - like a "Jump to Death" level where you can save time by doing an unsurvivable jump with a slim chance of touching level goal before dying.
</li><li> Some levels avert the trope by setting alternative victory condition of "having done X" where check for "X is done" is only performed when you are in relative safety.
</li><li> Some levels subvert the trope by making teleports that look like level goal.. It is not too dishonest - these points usually have to be reached anyway, but going headlong down the cliff doesn't work here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trackmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trackmania">Trackmania</a></em> titles do the same thing. Your time is recorded when you reach the finish, even though the track <em>ends</em> there and you usually fly off into oblivion or faceplant something solid immediately after crossing the finish line. Some track builders purposely place a ramp or obstacle there to make the inevitable post-finish crash all the more spectacular.

You have 90 minutes to complete the mission, much of it taken up fighting your way through tunnels to the door of the cavern, then a huge roomful of monsters between the door and the eight obelisks that have to be clicked at the same time. A stealth porter can get quickly through the tunnels to the door and then teleport the team. Once inside the chamber, the porter can then run to each obelisk and teleport a team member to it. Once they are clicked simultaneously, trial over, go team! It's entirely possible to complete the entire thing without having to engage in any combat, and often then only if a spawn of monsters is too close to the cavern door when you enter to allow the team to wait for the porter to do his thing. This is even <em>easier</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em>, as Stalkers have access to Hide at level one. In most non <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Missions</a>, you only have to clear out the last room, and even then that's only for newspaper missions.

This can happen twice, and the third time is an inevitable band failure... unless it happens close enough to the end for the song to complete (<em>including</em> the second or two it takes to transition from the song's end to the score screen) before that. It happens when a Big Rock Ending is involved, as the moment the Big Rock Ending hits, EVERYONE that was failed out is revived and the performance meter is removed.
</li><li> Also obvious in any song in the older games (Rock Band 2 and earlier), where the crowd would boo your band loudly, until you hit the invisible point that ended the song (which is usually well after the last actual note of the song). Then they would suddenly switch to cheering.

On a storyline level, this is what everyone hopes for the Crucible project - since the Reapers cannot be defeated in a straight fight, due to all their advantages, the goal is to complete the Crucible, find the Catalyst, and thereby kill the Reapers without needing to bleed the entire galaxy to death in a straight-out war. That's the theory, anyway; nobody's quite sure how the Crucible works or what it will do. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out, it's a lot more complicated than that - the Crucible's main purpose is to upgrade the Reaper's controlling intelligence, the Catalyst, so it can handle solutions to its purpose that are less bloody than "kill and/or enslave everything", allowing you to choose one. Still counts; successfully deploying a completed Crucible, unless you pick Refusal, allows you to end the Reaper war by wiping out all synthetic life including the Reapers, taking control of the Reapers yourself, or kicking off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">The Singularity</a> and leaving them with no <em>motive</em> to continue slaughtering people.</span>

</li><li> In a few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> missions where the main objective is <em>not</em> "wipe out all enemy forces" (specifically, some of the Tal'darim missions), the mission can be won by wiping out all enemy forces, at which point Matt Horner calls in to let you know the enemy is in retreat. Cue victory screen.
</li><li> One mission in <em>Heart of the Swarm</em> has the protoss sending ships and escorts to send word out to the Golden Armada, and Kerrigan having to take them out to prevent that.

</li><li> In most fighting games, once your opponent hits 0 life, any attacks still on screen are nullified. (In some games, you <em>can</em> be killed by on-screen attacks, in which case the round is a double KO.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> each side owns a single Mothership and the Instant-Win Condition is to destroy the enemy one.

It is possible, at least on lower difficulties, to gather all your starting units, ignore any and all enemy attacks, and march straight up to it and destroy it. You win the mission when that happens, never mind that your tiny force is surrounded in a large, well-garrisoned enemy city.

In fact, this is the <em>only</em> way to win, inasmuch as the rules are never stated in the game or instructions and are impossible to deduce from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">the Jester's commentary</a> (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">there aren't any</a>). (In an oddly-placed bit of realism, the game does allow some way to block this - it isn't automatically possible to <em>do</em> three undertrumps in a row following the discard - but the Jester isn't trying to stop it.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> When fighting against both Wesker and Jill Valentine, all you have to do is survive for 7 minutes. Even if you're on the cusp of death, once those 7 minutes go by, Wesker leaves. You still have to break Jill out of her mind controlled state, but that's easier than fighting a guy who can dodge a shotgun shot to the face at point-blank range.
</li><li> An interesting version occurs in the time travel RTS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achron">Achron</a></em>. One of the main win conditions for multiplayer maps is you win if all attack and build capable enemy units are destroyed at any point in time at or before the present and the other win condition is if that destruction falls off the timeline (becoming permanent). If the latter win condition is used then there is no way for the opponent to change what's happened because the events have become permanent but if the former is used you can win in the present even if your whole base has been destroyed in the past.

This can lead to some odd situations where a large airline, dominating the passenger totals, profits by big margins, loses to a much smaller airline that happen to dominate their home region and expand into three otherwise ignored regions.
</li><li> In the Razor Rendezvous mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Rogue Squadron</a> II</em>, the mission is automatically completed once the Star Destroyer is destroyed even if you did so by crashing into the bridge Arvel Crynyd style.

Even if you are alone in capturing, most or all of your team is dead, you have one hit point left, as long as you are in their base for the required time, you win, even if there is no way you could possibly hold the base. In the Assault mode, the match ends instantly in a defending team win once the timer hits zero, even if the attacking team was one second from capping the base and the last defending tank is hiding in a corner of the map with 10 HP.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a> 2</em>, an enemy Family is defeated once you take over their Compound.

Ribs completely shattered? Lungs on the floor? Stomach detached? Down to double digits of blood left? It's instant victory when you slap the replacement heart in the patient's chest! The game even lampshades it:
<div class="indent"> "Looks fine to me. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">I'm sure he'll live.</a>"

Once you hit 700,000 points (out of 1 million), you've cleared the song, though the song will keep going to the end. If you really want to, you can goof off or rest once you hit 700k rather than aiming for a higher score.

In Instant Action mode, the AI will instantly win if the player is killed - as the player is actually commanding from the field (rather than being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonEntityGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonEntityGeneral">Non-Entity General</a>) while in one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank">Hover Tanks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">walkers</a>, or in a command bunker, dying is a very real possibility if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat">ejection system</a> fails to take you back to safety. Enabling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">the respawn option</a> will prevent this from happening, however.
</li><li> In most battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">its sequel</a>, victory calls for defeating all enemies. In major boss battles, however, once you kill the boss, all other enemies will disappear.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena">Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</a> games, at the end of the day the only building that matters is the throne/ancient/nexus/whatever name the game calls the central building. Once a team manages to take down the defenses to this building, one sneak attack on the base by someone that can easily move about the map and/or quickly destroy buildings (commonly referred to as <em>backdooring</em>) is all that is needed to win, regardless of any money/experience/kill advantages the opposing team has accumulated. A (in)famous and recent example is the last game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">The International 3</a>, where, in the final game of the entire tournament, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alliance won the game by never fighting NaVi head-on, and instead using the teleportation abilities of Nature's Prophet and Wisp to destroy NaVi's base while the remaining heroes (most importantly, s4's Puck) stalled and then cancelled teleports, preventing an effective defense</span>.
</li><li> In the military battles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate">Exit Fate</a></em>, victory is achieved by taking out the army leader - once they fall, all their troops call for retreat, so you can snatch up a desperate victory just by aiming for their group. (Although not defeating the other units will result in a reduced efficiency score and likely net you a worse reward.) The same thing applies to your army, so keeping your protagonist out of direct fire is a good idea.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GenjuuRyodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GenjuuRyodan">Genjuu Ryodan</a></em>, capturing the main building (usually the castle) of the opponent's side instantly clears the map which is being played in.
</li><li> VS. battles in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalDrop">Magical Drop</a></em> series can be won either through the traditional method of outlasting your opponent, or by scoring enough points to meet the point quota, at which point you win even if you're one balloon-shift away from getting wiped out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrozenSynapse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrozenSynapse">Frozen Synapse</a></em>: A number of missions involve eliminating one specific target, which is lucky if you have a shotgun vatform running around the back while the rest of your troops get blown to pieces; even if your last unit goes down, taking out the objective wins you the mission if that happens first.
</li><li> Destroying all targets in a mission or destroying a boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CopyKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CopyKitty">Copy Kitty</a></em> destroys all remaining enemies and enemy projectiles. Even if Boki still manages to get killed, it still counts as a win. Reaching a wave in Endless Mode that's a multiple of 5 also allows the player to start again from there even if they get killed right before the wave transistion.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope">Silent Scope</a></em> games, a headshot instantly kills the boss regardless of how much health he has left. As bosses got more durable and/or harder to hit, the importance of headshots grew in importance; some (Cobra, Monica, The Collector, Sho &amp; Kane, Shadow, Charly) are next to impossible to beat any other way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em>: As long as the player can make it to 6 AM, they will win. It doesn't matter if the power has gone out, all four animatronics are on the loose, and Freddy is in the middle of playing his jingle right outside the door before he kills you; 6 AM means a guaranteed victory. The later games take it even further by enabling you to win even if an animatronic is in the middle of jumping at your face to kill you. Generally, this is justified by Free-Roaming Mode only being enabled from midnight to 6 AM (i.e. your shift), so when the clock ticks over, they can no longer move.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateCustomNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateCustomNight">Ultimate Custom Night</a></em> provides the series' one subversion of this trope: Funtime Foxy. Funtime Foxy's M.O. is to jumpscare you if you aren't looking at his camera at the start of a specific hour (his 'showtime'), and if that hour is 6 AM, Funtime Foxy can still jumpscare you if you aren't watching him.
</li></ul></li><li> A fanmod named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtVault5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtVault5">Five Nights at Vault 5</a></em> will instantly turn off all robots and alarms and clear off all of your radiation if you successfully reach 6 AM, regardless of whether your radiation was about to reach lethal levels and a robot was in the middle of charging at you.
</li><li> Besides the normal win condition of reaching the finish line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoardGameOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoardGameOnline">Board Game Online</a></em>, there are two other ways to win:
<ul><li> Escaping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TempleOfDoom">Pyramid</a> with the Pharaoh's treasure.
</li><li> Combining the Sausage, Eggs, Bacon, and Spam items to make the English breakfast.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsterColiseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsterColiseum">Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum</a></em>, destroying the Symbol game piece will net a win regardless of how many monsters are left on either side. You can also win by destroying all of your opponent's monsters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris">Nectaris</a></em>, if one army captures the other's base camp, they win the battle instantly. The usual way to attempt this is to load an infantry unit into a Pelican and fly it past enemy lines.
</li><li> Happens in classical first person shooters such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>. Sometimes it's explained as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGoal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGoal">Level Goal</a> being an elevator, an exit door, a self-destruct switch (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em>), but then there are situations where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGoal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGoal">Level Goal</a> is a lonely switch in the middle of a room, and it's not explained how pressing it lets you instantly escape from a giant horde of monsters surrounding you on all sides.
</li><li> Some mission and quest challenges in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSnakeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSnakeman">Billy vs. SNAKEMAN</a></em> have "automatic jutsu victory": if you use a specific jutsu, you will win it no matter how poor your successes are. It's not stated outright, but there's either a logical thought to it (A horde of enemies attacking everywhere? This calls for a clone jutsu!) or the description references the solution in some other way (The enemy says his attack goes to eleven? How about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">"Rock On: Spinal Tap"</a>?). There's also the Flying Thunder God Jutsu, which allows you to complete one non-quest challenge with a difficulty not higher than 100 each day.
</li><li> In the single-player campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics">Telepath Tactics</a></em>, a few maps will grant you an instant win the moment you move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Emma</a> to a certain space, which can make them trivial if you stock up on adrenaline pills. This is a little weird in the mines entrance battle, where logically any remaining troops should be nipping at your heels in the next battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy">Decapitated Army</a> is also in effect for most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battles</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the level "Long Night of Solace", destroying the Phantoms attacking Anchor 9 will cause all the other enemy starfighters to flee, even if they still outnumber you.
</li><li> Several levels, like "Exodus", are won by pressing a button, so a clever player can sneak past a lot to activate the device even if a horde of enemies are surrounding it.
</li><li> In the level <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"The Pillar of Autumn"</span>, destroying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Covenant battlecruiser</span> will end the level regardless of how many Phantoms are surrounding you. On the more punishing difficulties like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Legendary or Mythic</a>, destroying <em>only</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cruiser</span> becomes the only reliable way to complete the level.
</li></ul></li><li> Some missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercsOfBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercsOfBoom">Mercs of Boom</a></em> can be won even if you're down to a single surviving merc with 1 HP. If the win conditions are met (e.g. survive for 5 turns), your still-standing mercs will start cheering, even if they're surrounded by enemies about to slaughter them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacificFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacificFleet">Atlantic Fleet</a></em>, you can win a battle even if there are 5 torpedoes bearing down on your ship and will strike you at the end of your turn, as long as you sink all enemy ships before that or force them to withdraw. The battle ends immediately without completing the turn.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</a></em>, if you win the coin flip at the beginning of the game, Zero honors his deal, releases you all, and the credits roll. You win the game with zero effort on your part.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has every dungeon use boss battles and they sometimes have the boss summon backup. If you can defeat the boss, you automatically win while the backup just vanishes into thin air.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> has safe houses that are basically level goals. As long as one survivor makes it inside and shuts the door, the survivors live to see the next level, even if 3 of them were killed. Same rule applies for reaching the escape vehicle. The sequel uses the same rules.
</li><li> Most of the boss fights in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> will be instant victory to you, regardless if the boss's summoned help were left standing. While the same rule applies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>, two boss fights in the former take place in hazardous areas where there's no safe zone to recharge in, making it possible to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">die to the toxic atmosphere afterwards</a>.

<div class="indent"> This will result in many research centers, and a plummeting economy, but we'll be dead or Gods in thirty weeks, so what are the loan sharks going to do? Pray threateningly?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires">Age of Empires</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original game, there are two ways to complete a mission: complete the goal that the game tells you to, or destroy everything belonging to all opposing teams, thus destroying any opposition, including units, buildings, and even just walls. Logically, this makes some kind of sense, as there's no way you can't be the first to complete the goal if you are the only one left, but in non time-based missions where your goal is to build a wonder (for example) destroying your opposition and allies does not help you build a wonder.
</li><li> The sequel sidesteps this by including placeholder units in unreachable corners of the map, so the player can never technically wipe out a given side and are forced to complete the scenario objectives. One mission in particular is known for having the placeholder not quite hidden well enough, allowing it to be killed, preventing a massive army from spawning later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityBuildingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityBuildingSeries">City-Building Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pharaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a></em>, some missions have vastly reduced requirements, such as having a certain population and completed monuments. Meaning the city could be an urban hellhole of plague-infested slums bereft of basic sanitation, food, or maintenance services rife with criminals, enemy armies can be rampaging throughout the land, but the second you send the tomb is ready for its occupant you can hightail it out of there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeusMasterOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeusMasterOfOlympus">Zeus: Master of Olympus</a></em>, colony missions only require you to set aside a certain amount of goods for the parent city, meaning you only need to set up a few industries and a few dozen people to operate them. It's possible to simplify this even further by asking allies for the goods in question before sending them off, and the colony will continue to produce goods in subsequent levels.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em> does this to a ridiculous degree. You finish the race as soon as you cross the finish line on the final lap no matter what condition your vehicle is in. This means you can lose all of your energy and slide across the finish line while exploding. As long as you don't fully explode before crossing the line, you can win and then die immediately afterwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientEmpires">Ancient Empires</a></em>: Killing the enemy king in the first game counts as a win, even if the enemy still has a lot of units. This is no longer the case in the sequel, where commanders are a unit that can be produced from castles (albeit only one at a time and for an escalating cost), so the condition is instead capturing all enemy castles.
</li><li> Several missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> require you to rescue (or capture) a VIP: as soon as the VIP is on the Skyranger, you win, even if your squad gets wiped out afterwards (though most players will consider that a lose condition). The same is true of the Blacksite missions, which involve getting a specific piece of physical intel back to the Avenger: as soon as the soldier carrying it is on the Skyranger, victory is assured.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BYOND" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BYOND">BYOND</a> Game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceStation13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceStation13">Space Station 13</a></em>:
<ul><li> The traitor can be on the shuttle, surrounded by security officers and high personnel with tasers, and (if the objective doesn't require solitary escape) they will win the round when the shuttle leaves.
</li><li> If the entire nuke team (usually 3-5 people) or the wizard dies, the crew instantly wins. Even if they use the 'suicide' verb.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateChickenHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateChickenHorse">Ultimate Chicken Horse</a></em>, your goal is to reach a flag in the level while dodging hazards, but as long as you reach that flag you win. Even if you were getting shot full of arrows after reaching the flag that knocks you away (and possibly even off a ledge) if still counts, and likewise you still get victory points if you die but your corpse manages to reach the flag (although the points awarded are not as much as reaching the flag alive).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em> ends the game in victory if you defeat the Rebel Flagship. Even if half of your ship is on fire, the other half is oxygen-deprived, one more hit would take your ship out, and your sole remaining crewmember has less than 10% of their health left. <em>Even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">your ship is in the middle of blowing up</a></em>, so long as the Flagship runs out of hull integrity before the game summons the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen. Justified, in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">the Rebel Flagship holds the top command of the Rebel Fleet</a> and destroying it deals a major blow to their command structure, and the overall goal of the game is to defeat the Rebels by blowing up said Flagship, not necessarily to save your own hides.
</li><li> The Assault gamemode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament">Unreal Tournament</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> consists of two phases: in the first round, the Red team assumes the attacking role, and the Blue team the defending role. After the first phase ends (either by objective completion or time running out), both teams switch roles, with the Blue team attacking and the Red team defending. In this round, the Blue team wins if they complete more objectives than the Red team did in the first phase, in case the first phase ended with the Red team not managing to complete every objective, regardless of time left for the objectives to be completed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> ends with Faith climbing to the top of the Shard (which at this point is swarming with cops chasing after her to take her down) to rescue Kate before she's taken away via helicopter. When she gets to the roof <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she finds a good half-dozen armed guards and Jackknife hauling Kate into the helicopter. After kicking Jackknife out of the helicopter and crashing it, all the armed guards on the roof that would've gunned down Faith and Kate mysteriously vanish, and instead of dealing with the logistics of Faith escaping from the top of a skyscraper swarming with armed officers while escorting a far less agile Kate, the game decides to just have the two embrace and roll credits while glossing over their escape off-screen.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnergyBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnergyBreaker">Energy Breaker</a></em>: the usual goal for a battle is "defeat all the enemies", but some have "ally makes it to goal" or "defeat the boss" as additional goals, which will clear the battle regardless of how many enemies are left.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerQueen">Killer Queen</a></em>, there are three ways for a team to win: Economic Victory (have a full stash of berries in the base), Military Victory (kill the enemy's queen three times), and Snail Victory (ride the snail all the way to the team's goal). As soon as any of these three conditions are met, the team wins, even if their enemy has a blatant advantage on the other two conditions (example: your team wins by Economic Victory with one queen life left and about to be double-pronged by an enemy Warrior and Queen and the snail just pixels away from the enemy's goal).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WreckingCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WreckingCrew">Wrecking Crew</a> '98</em>, pulling off a 9x chain combo will unleash a "Kanbank" attack, which is a giant falling Bowser crate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHKOs</a> the opponent and can't be dodged.

Even if there's still rampaging precursors, space pirates, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayGoo">Gray Goo</a> infestation, metal-eating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaMicrobes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaMicrobes">Mega-Microbes</a> and an indestructible fleet-munching behemoth all running around the galaxy, if the AI Overlord is dead, you still win.

</li><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> games, in addition to the instant <em>knockdown</em> methods against every boxer, often have secret outright instant K.O. tricks you can use to quickly win matches. Glass Joe can be taken down instantly if you counter his taunt either with precise timing or with a Star Punch, Piston Honda goes down in one shot if you counter the Honda Rush with a body blow, and King Hippo's first knockdown is also a guaranteed knockout.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life  </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most fighting sports are like this. If you knock out/pin your opponent or make him submit to you, you win right then and there and don't have to sweat out the judge's score cards. Though generally, the fighter who gets more points is doing a better job in the fight and more likely to KO/pin his opponent.
</li><li> This philosophy was taken to its logical extreme during a particular wrestling match in ancient Greece, where one participant pinned down his opponent with an attack which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">killed him instantly</a>. The referee didn't notice that he'd died until after he'd declared him the victor, making him probably the only person to be declared the winner of a wrestling match posthumously. In the brutal sport of Pankration (Ancient Greek Wrestling), one of the insta-win conditions is to die in the ring (i.e. if you kill your opponent, your opponent automatically wins). It serves as an incentive for the fighters to go easier on each other.
</li><li> Pool has a couple versions. In Nine-ball pool, if you pocket the 9 ball on any legal shot, you win regardless of how many other balls remain on the table. In Eight-ball if <em>your opponent</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">pockets the 8 ball before all of their other balls or makes a foul while trying to pocket the 8</a>, you win.
</li><li> In the ancient (and unnamed) Mesoamerican Ball Game, you scored points by bouncing the ball against the opposing team's side of the stadium, but you could automatically win by knocking it into a tiny circle situated high up on the wall just barely large enough to fit the ball through. This would be humiliating enough if it weren't for the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">their entire team was sacrificed for losing the game</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vzuc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vzuc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vzuc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually, most historians are pretty sure it was the winners who proved themselves to be worthy of being sacrificed, so it depends on your point of view whether this is an instant win or instant lose; the other team was simply killed the normal way. Some rightly call this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> situation.</span>
</li><li> In actual warfare, many often forget that the point of a war is not necessarily to just annihilate the other side but to achieve some objective. Sometimes this objective is so important that if one side manages to achieve it, there's no point in continuing to fight.
<ul><li> In the 19th and 20th centuries, this objective was often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalOffensive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalOffensive">the capture of the enemy's capital</a>, since that was a deathblow to morale and eliminated the enemy's command and control ability; see the fall of France in 1940, the fall of Germany in 1945, the Franco-Prussian war in 1871. This usually depends on how your enemy is structured - capturing capitals (if they even had one) of less centralized adversaries (e.g., the Americans during the American Revolution, the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War) would generally prove to be a less devastating defeat.
</li><li> It may also be the capture or destruction of a critical resource or person that cripples the enemy's ability to wage war or negates his reasons for fighting. For example, the Kuwaiti oil fields in the first Gulf War, or the capture of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.
</li><li> Modern warfare rarely has any way of winning instantly (hence guerilla warfare). However, a single tactical battle can be enough to win the strategic war, even if fighting continues. This usually happens when your opponent's main force is sufficiently bloodied, crippled or damaged enough that, while they can continue to fight, their effectiveness is severely reduced and the best they can hope for is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>. Guerilla warfare <em>depends</em> on this outcome: with the guerillas being massively outnumbered, they can only hope to inflict enough casualties on their opponents to force them to consider an objective as "not worth it".
</li></ul></li><li> Sudden Death overtime in sports, although the specifics on how it works varies by sport.
<ul><li> In baseball extra innings, the game is over when one team has the lead at the end of an inning. The visiting team always bats first in each inning, so if they take a lead, the home team has the bottom half of the inning to respond, but if the home team takes a lead the game is immediately over. In addition, if the home team is winning at the end of the first half of the ninth inning, they immediately win (since the visiting team has no more opportunities to score).
</li><li> In American football overtime, scoring a touchdown (6 points) at any time ends the game. If the team that receives the kickoff only scores a field goal (3 points) on their first possession, the other team gets one possession to respond, and if they score a field goal of their own, the next team to score in any way wins. If the recieving team doesn't score on their first possession, the next score wins. Any defensive score (a safety or an interception/fumble returned for a touchdown) immediately ends the game. The other instant win condition is if the team that is winning has or takes control of the ball with (approximately) 1 minute left on the game clock: they can easily run "quarterback kneel" plays that stop play but keep the clock going until the match is over, and the defense can do nothing about it.
</li><li> Ice hockey overtime is pure sudden death...if somebody scores, the game is over. In the regular season, only a short OT period is generally played with reduced manpower (4-on-4 or 3-on-3 instead of 5-on-5) and is followed by a shootout (3 rounds of penalty shots, then continuing with additional rounds if needed) if nobody scores. In the playoffs, regular 20-minute periods will be played until the game is decided.
</li><li> One (much more esoteric) instant win condition in sports is nearly universal: if you cannot field a full team, then you forfeit and your opponent wins. While this normally never happens, it is <em>possible</em> for a team in a full-contact sport to have enough people injured to not have enough players to continue, resulting in a forfeit.
</li></ul></li><li> An anecdote printed in an early <em>Magic: the Gathering</em> tournament rule-book related the story of a play-tester that was inexplicably winning almost every game. Upon investigation, it was discovered that one of the player's cards (<em>Time Walk</em>, which is still a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> and one of the Power Nine, but isn't an instant win on its own) read, 'When this card is played, opponent loses next turn' (as in, 'the opponent skips his next turn'), but the player interpreted the text to mean 'the opponent loses <em>the match</em> next turn' and had been using that inadvertent loophole as an instant-win condition. The card's text was quickly re-written to state that the person who played the card took an extra turn.
