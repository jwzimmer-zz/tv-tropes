<ul><li> The Black Knights of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, particularly Ohgi, fall victim to this when they fall for both logical and moral incongruities put forth by Schneizel to turn them against Lelouch. Ohgi, despite believing that people should not be treated as pawns, nevertheless allows himself and the others to be manipulated by Schneizel in order to get rid of Lelouch. He probably thought of it as choosing the lesser of two evils. In the same scenario, Villetta Nu, while acting out of concern for Ohgi, leaves out a number of details (that she may or may not even have been aware of herself, given that it's likely all her information on it came from Emperor Charles and who knows how honest he was with her) that would have cast a favorable light on Lelouch, namely the limitations of said power, thereby needlessly (or maliciously) hurting the latter's case. And Ohgi, who claims that people should never be used as pawns, uses Kallen as one to draw out Lelouch, who he intends to sell out to Schneizel, as yet another, in exchange for Japan. On top of this, for all the complaints of Lelouch going AWOL during the Black Rebellion, Ohgi did the same a few episodes before the current predicament here on account of Villetta.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> cheaters like Bandit Keith, who had cards stashed up his sleeves to be able to draw cards he needs, and Espa Roba, who had partners on rooftops spying on his opponent's deck and reporting to him via earpiece so he could "psychically predict" his opponent's tactics, are always called out as such and often even punished by disqualification or worse. Characters who use the "Heart of the Cards", a mystical force that allows them to influence their draw and magically get the right card at the right time, are never called out as such and this is an accepted tactic even though the only real difference between this and Bandit Keith's tactic is the Heart of the Cards is magic while the other tactic relies on machine-aided sleight-of-hand.

<ul><li> The very first story with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> (or 'the Cat' as she was known at first) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> sternly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheFourthWall">Break The Fourth Wall</a> to remind the readers that crooks should never be admired and be fought at every turn. Four pages later he allows the Cat to escape (and deliberately foils <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robin</a>'s attempt to stop her) for the <em>sole</em> reason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">he finds her sexy</a> - other than being a non-violent thief (who still put people's lives in danger by choosing a scumbag partner when she robbed a yacht) there are <em>no</em> other extenuating circumstances in favor of letting her go.
</li><li> The most absurd version of this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a>.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> made a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">deal with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mephisto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mephisto">Mephisto</a></em>. You know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">big demon guy</a>? Makes deals with people and then screws them over? The deal in question? He wiped his and his wife's marriage from history, aborting their unborn baby in the process, just so his aunt who, even in terms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">comic book aging</a> is older than the Bill of Rights, can recover from a gunshot wound to live for a couple more years before finally kicking the bucket. And to add insult to injury, she only got shot in the first place because Spidey revealed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> to the public, making the exact scenario he has been harping about <em>for bloody years</em> as to why he specifically shouldn't take off his mask. In other words, Aunt May was shot because of Peter's mistake and he was unwilling to take responsibility for his actions. And we were meant to think this act is heroic somehow. The Moral Dissonance? Spider-Man just about giving the Devil the chance to fiddle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers instead of taking responsibility for her death goes completely against the saying "With Great Power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">Comes Great Responsibility</a>." (The most defining part of his entire character).

Never mind the fact that they were, if not mind controlled, then heavily influenced, by the Phoenix and shouldn't be held responsible, but many of the people condemning them for their actions have <em>also</em> committed crimes while not themselves, but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s behavior during the whole debacle is very similar to the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> acted during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, which Cap was violently against.

Even when the cattle rustlers step up their game by slapping her friends around and lighting some buildings on fire, and even after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">called out on her behavior by Applejack</a> she refuses. However in the finale when King Longhorn kicks down a "historic landmark", suddenly that's due cause for her to finally step up and do something.

Superman was revealed to have been aware of certain League members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">mindwiping Batman and other individuals</a>, Batman had created a super spy satellite called Brother Eye to observe and monitor metahumans across the globe and Wonder Woman killed Maxwell Lord to stop him from mind controlling Superman. Of these three, Wonder Woman's "sin" was really not a sin at all, especially when you take into account that Lord was trying to start a war between human and metahumans by making Superman go on a rampage and he wasn't even the first person Wonder Woman had killed. Despite this, the DC writers treated this with far more severity and scrutiny than either Superman or Batman's transgressions; Superman's knowledge of the mindwipes was never brought up in <em>Infinite Crisis</em> and Batman creating Brother Eye was pretty much forgotten about after that story. Yet, Diana killing Max became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a> moment for her. Not helping things was the implication that Diana killing Max was only a big deal because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">looked human</a>.

During Morrison's run, Huntress attempted to kill the super villain Prometheus after he tried to start World War 3 while Black Canary was revealed to have been part of the cabal of League members that mindwiped Batman and others in <em>Identity Crisis</em>. Huntress was booted off the League by Batman and hasn't served on a League roster since. Black Canary was made the League's chairwoman even after her actions were found out.

He is told that it is not allowed and he sighs, saying it will be hard to explain to his men that they can't. Later, his fiancée talks about how she murdered men who attempted to rape her. He clearly shows how he thinks rape is wrong and he is glad they died. No one in the story seems to recall or mention that he was unhappy that his men weren't allowed to rape women earlier.

A young Dragonlord who hasn't yet changed into a dragon - no one but the older Dragonlords even know what she is - is randomly attacked by said noble and almost blinded - and the older Dragonlord characters, upset, consider it an outrage because a human attacked a semidivine being, and it's repeatedly stated that they wouldn't be upset at all if she was the commoner she appeared to be.

The Jedi and the Republic, the <em>good guys</em> of the Star Wars universe who supposedly outlawed slavery, use an army of mass-produced living slaves as cannon fodder for a war in which the soldiers have no stake. They're forced into live-fire training, killed if they don't meet the standards of the cloners, and deprived of even having namesall between the ages of 2 and 10, before the war even starts. When the fighting begins they're given no civil rights, no citizenship, no legal standing at all in the society they're fighting for. They're aging twice as fast as naturally born beings, and if they're too injured to continue fighting, they're left to die or euthanized. They were bound to serve for life or until old age inhibited their ability to fight, and any attempts at desertion were met with an assassin squad. This was commented on multiple times in the Expanded Universe; the clones had people fighting for their civil rights, citizenship, and legal standing in the Senate. Palpatine always obstructs them, however, and gets REALLY pissed when his attempts to create more cannon fodder are shot down.

</li><li> Even though he was non-lethal, Roy Harper's attempts at vigilantism are repeatedly shot down early on, with Oliver even <em>shooting him</em> at one point to keep him out of trouble.

Yet despite Malcolm having been responsible for the Undertaking, as well as Oliver's origin story, and as a result was responsible for the deaths of Robert Queen, Tommy Merlyn, the aforementioned Sara, and a few hundred innocent people, Oliver <em>refused</em> to kill him or let others do so. Fine, but then he <em>also</em> refuses to take him down and hand him over to the police, either. <em>Then</em> he refuses to let him be handed over to the League of Assassins' custody to face his crimes. All of this he justifies because vengeance is hollow and you shouldn't kill someone out of revenge. How does this season end?

</li><li> The Tenth Doctor deposing Prime Minister Harriet Jones in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2005CSTheChristmasInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2005CSTheChristmasInvasion">"The Christmas Invasion"</a>:
<ul><li> The Doctor himself is perfectly capable of committing mass murder against hostile alien species, has done so on numerous occasions, and would continue to do so.
</li><li> In deposing Harriet Jones, the Doctor is violating his own often-stated moral standards of not interfering with major historical events or "fixed points in time" as they're called in this series. We had it on no less authority than <em>the Doctor himself</em> that Harriet Jones was supposed to have three successful terms as Prime Minister and lead Britain into a Golden Age. That sure as Hell sounded like a "fixed point in time" if there ever was one. But then she decided to have the retreating Sycorax killed in "The Christmas Invasion", and Ten got mad. Keep in mind that the aliens had already shown that at least their leader was not above being forced to surrender but instead trying to stab his enemy in the back when they lower their guard, which greatly weakens the Doctor's argument about attacking a retreating species whom was already more than willing to hold a planet at ransom. Furthermore, everything that's happened since then in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Whoniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Whoniverse">Whoniverse</a> in regards to the British premiership  such as Mr. Saxon (aka the Master), and then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>'s Brian Green  that the Doctor didn't just change history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">he also changed history for the worse!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Another example is when Ten gets furious at his clone for wiping out the Daleks in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd">Journey's End</a>". Despite the fact that earlier in that series he had wiped out the Pyroviles, a much less objectionable species, to save humanity and in the process killed 20,000 innocent people, though this <em>was</em> a fixed point in time. Even more ridiculous as the Daleks had come close to destroying the entire universe, had only temporarily been beaten, and were the only ones destroyed by the clone!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E2TheBeastBelow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E2TheBeastBelow">"The Beast Below"</a>: The Doctor, while very upset at the time, tells Amy he's going to drop her back home after she waited <em>14 years</em> to travel with him because she messes up in a relatively minor way on her first trip. To make matters worse, she only did so to try and prevent him from making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E7TheLongGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E7TheLongGame">Adam</a> did far worse!
</li><li> Then again, years later the <em>Twelfth</em> Doctor decides <strong>not</strong> to interfere with a point in time that's in flux in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon">Kill the Moon</a>", and let humanity decide its own fate  leaving his companion Clara in charge, believing that she/humanity can and will make the best choice under the circumstances. She does, but then chews out and temporarily abandons him, leaving him <em>friendless</em>, for not just taking care of things himself! So much for not sticking his nose in where it doesn't belong. (In general, Twelve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">gets called out a lot more often for his more morally dubious actions and attitudes than his predecessors</a>.)
</li><li> Goes for everyone else, too: often the same characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike">Complaining About Rescues They Don't Like</a> because it's <em>interfering</em> or even because having the ability to stop the crisis makes him <em>too scary</em> will stand silently by when he's <em>actually</em> doing some dark stuff.

<ul><li> What establishes Griffin Grey as a villain is him kidnapping Harry Wells, which he did because he was dying and desperately wanted to find a cure. When Barry kidnapped someone (not a villain) for less understandable reason a few episodes earlier no one cared. Aside from that, in Season 1 Barry kidnaps a prisoner, forces him to be a whistleblower and when Barry is done with the prisoner, he leaves him as a fugitive (he was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>, but still).
</li><li> In the Season 3 epìsodes with Gorilla Grodd, Barry is lectured by Iris and Harry that he shouldn't kill but be merciful and that he shouldn't ruin his purity. Except he was not so merciful with Atom Smasher and Sand Demon in Season 2, or Zoom in the finale.
</li><li> Later, when dealing with the Thinker, Barry adamantly scolds rookie hero Ralph that they <em>cannot</em> kill him, because they're good guys and good guys don't kill. This is despite the aforementioned Zoom, Atom Smasher, and Sand Demon, as well as others they've killed in the past (Clyde Mardon, Savitar, Rival, etc).
</li></ul></li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveNewYork">I Love New York</a></em>, it's unforgivable to say something horrible about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkSue">New York's</a> mother Sister Patterson, but it's perfectly fine for her to insult a contestant's family members! There's a reason why Tango dumping her at the reunion show (because she insulted his mother).
</li><li> The moral framework of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin (2008)</a></em> was convoluted to say the least. Essentially, the shows core conflict pitted an oppressed magical class against the powerful kings of Camelot, who enforced a genocidal regime against all those who practiced magic. The setup is that the protagonist Merlin must secretly use his magic to protect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Arthur</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> who is destined to reign over a fair and just Camelot. Merlin gets this information from Kilgharrah, a prophetic dragon that Uther has chained up in the dungeons, who promises him that Arthur will lift the ban on magic and free Merlins people once hes king. In light of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, two major problems emerge from this premise.
<ul><li> 1. The fact that Merlin blindly takes orders from the morally ambiguous Kilgharrah gets more and more exasperating at the series goes on. Among other things, the dragon holds back on vital information that nearly results in the death of Merlins mother, guns for the deaths of Mordred and Morgana before theyve actually done anything wrong (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">and whose condemnation of them partially results in them becoming the antagonists that he initially warned Merlin against</a>) and who at one point lays waste to Camelot once hes freed from his chains, killing at least 76 people, and even taking a near-fatal swoop at Arthur.
</li><li> Now, this wouldnt be moral dissonance if Merlin <em>acknowledged</em> all this and cut ties with the dragon, but the bizarre thing is that no matter what Kilgharrah says or does, Merlin (and the narrative) continues to treat Kilgharrah as a font of wisdom and good advice. Even when his prophesies are <em>flat-out contradicted by events</em>, or when he <em>clearly</em> manipulates Merlin into doing something against his better instincts (which always leads to disaster) its simply ignored by Merlin, who continues to trust that Kilgharrah gives him sound information and guidance, calling him "old friend" on more than one occasion.
</li><li> 2. Despite all of Kilgharrahs prophesies that Arthur would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good King</a> who lifts the ban on magic and allows everyone to live in peace and harmony  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>hes not</em>. Merlin and Arthur never actually get around to legalizing magic, much less integrating magic-users back into society, rendering all of Kilgharrahs prophesies/Merlins efforts null and void. What we end up with is a hero who  instead of <em>fighting</em> the oppressive, genocidal regime he lived in  spent ten years actively supporting it, eliminating any threats to it, and protecting the two people who enforced it, in the hopes that one day things would get better simply because a manipulative, deceitful dragon told him it would. Since it <em>doesnt</em> (at least not under Arthurs reign, its confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that Guinevere handled things much better after Arthurs death)</span>, then all of Merlins methods in protecting Arthur and Camelots anti-magical stance are thrown into a highly questionable light.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06c60');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06c60" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06c60');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This includes manipulating people, consistently lying to loved ones and keeping back vital information, making crucial decisions on behalf of other people without their knowledge or permission, killing in order to keep things a secret, regularly throwing fellow magic-users under the proverbial bus, unleashing a powerful magical force that kills dozens of innocent people, using magic to brainwash people into acting against their will (and deriving enjoyment from it), making pre-emptive strikes against individuals who have yet to threaten them in any way, murdering in cold blood, and remaining single-mindedly devoted to a dubious cause on the insistence of an equally dubious mentor-figure — in other words, everything that Morgana, the shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> does.</span> Also baffling is that Kilgharrah waxed lyrical about Arthurs destiny as a fair and just king, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he didnt end up doing <strong>anything</strong> to improve the lot of magical folk</span>, whilst simultaneously condemning Morgana as an evil witch, even though she was initially <em>fighting</em> for magical rights and was desperate to remove Uther from the throne  two of Kilgharrahs own goals. You cant help but feel that Kilgharrah was betting on the wrong horse, even though his frequent warnings to Merlin about Morganas imminent evil only resulted in Merlin isolating Morgana — one of the key factors in turning her against Camelot in the first place.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> In several incarnations the eponymous heroes are told (or even have it be part of their song lyrics) to only use their powers for defense. This explains why they never use the Megazord to stomp the monster before it grows (they won't risk the property damage until the enemy forces their hand) or why they never directly attack the villain's base (although they did so in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Dino Thunder</a></em> after they found its location). However, there have been more than a few occasions where they blew up the monster while it was helpless and in some cases practically begging for mercy. There's one particular instance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">MMPR</a></em> ("Two Heads Are Better Than One'') where the Red Ranger seems downright sadistic...

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Jason:</strong> Then we have no choice! <em>(kills the monster)</em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a>,</em> the Megazord goes completely medieval on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> Clawhammer, who was attacking them, to be sure... but maybe ripping out his tendrils, kicking him repeatedly in the groin, and throwing him into lava was <em>a tad excessive.</em> Maybe whatever Clawhammer had done in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a> episode the fight footage came from was a <em>lot</em> more evil than his <em>Power Rangers</em> actions of simply being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">literal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a>. Even worse, Clawhammer was just a mindless alien predator that didn't even work for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Astronema</a>. Sure, you could blame Astronema for siccing the creature on the Rangers, but in the end, it was just someone who was dragged into the fight against its will. (As for the sentai version, the corresponding monster <em>was</em> created by the main villains, and was killed by being thrown into a volcano because he was made of a metal their weapons couldn't penetrate. Still no excuse for the tendril ripping and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>; it's not like he'd done something above and beyond the call of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> nastiness. <em>If</em> there's such a thing as using excessive force against a monster trying to kill you, both teams used it that day.)
</li><li> Later series have the Rangers being more likely to chase down and kill fleeing monsters that the original Rangers would have allowed to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">Villain: Exit, Stage Left</a>. Strangely, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> isn't one, despite the higher consequences of letting a bad guy go free.
</li><li> A horrible case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em>. There Animus actually <em>takes the Wildzords away</em> because humans have polluted the planet (ignoring that the Orgs would probably win because of this and make the planet even worse). He does give them back eventually, claiming that it was a test for the Power Rangers but that ignores the fact that the Rangers had already been fighting the Orgs for quite some time before Animus did a thing to help them.
</li><li> In season 2 of the original series, Bulk and Skull's efforts to learn the Rangers' identities result in several occasions of the heroes being complete <em>dicks</em> to them, maliciously destroying any evidence they got.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> often insists on a "no-killing" policy, telling his allies and enemies alike that he only kills people when absolutely necessary. This... is rubbish. By the end of the series, he had needlessly shot countless guards (often in the back), a mentally-deranged man who was holding his friend hostage (this was <em>after</em> trying to kill him earlier in the episode whilst he was <em>unconscious</em>), and a corrupt churchman who wasn't doing anything more threatening than just standing there making bitchy comments. The worst example is when he barges into a woman's bedroom to find that she's just killed her sadistic husband in self-defense. He grabs her around the throat and accuses her of murder, <em>minutes</em> after shooting dead an executioner who was just doing his job. The fact that the show had long since established Robin as a flawless archer means that all of these deaths could have easily been non-fatal injuries if he had so chosen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> is undoubtedly so full of them that one could spend hours yelling at the TV in frustration of Clark's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood">repetitively poor and self destructive decisions</a>. For example, he will often lecture other heroes, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>, or earlier Lana, on how important honesty is, and in the case of the heroes, encouraging them to unmask themselves to their significant others, while causing huge problems and creating danger out the wazoo for his own while protecting his own secret. The entire Superman franchise is founded on this, however.
<ul><li> Apparently, it is not okay for Chloe to protect Clark's secret from Lana but it is okay <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for Lana to lock her into a freezing cellar to trick Clark into revealing his powers. She doesn't even know that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>. She only witnessed his invulnerability (and she isn't even sure what she saw)</span>. She also does a lot of other stuff like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">holding Lionel captive, spying and almost killing Lex.</span> Seriously, the only thing that stops her from being a complete unsympathetic villain is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">isn't exactly a nice person</a>. She is still portrayed as Clark's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">perfect girlfriend</a>.
</li><li> A particularly infuriating example: Clark kicks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Oliver</a> out of the League for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Lex</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">conveniently forgetting he had attempted to do the exact same thing</a>. <em>Twice</em>. Even worse, Clark told Chloe about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first attempt</span>, and Lana <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was there for the second.</span> Not one of the three brings up this blatant hypocrisy, and opt to lecture him on how unheroic he's being instead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Because all ''true'' heroes break their own rules while enforcing them on others.</a>
</li><li> Lana having Lionel kidnapped and held hostage by a psychopath in retaliation for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blackmailing her into marrying Lex</span> despite knowing he did that for Clark's sake and had no other options. It was clearly done out of revenge, yet she insists she, in fact was protecting Clark knowing that isn't the truth.
</li><li> The Justice League, especially Clark, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">treating Tess like family, despite her attempting to murder Chloe and Lana, and successfully murdering others</a>, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Livewire</span>, who was a mere car thief as opposed to the murderous supervillain she is in the comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">simply for defying her.</a> Clark had personally promised Bette that Tess would pay for her crimes, only to forget that promise because he felt her heart was in the right place.
</li><li> On that note, forgiving Ultraman, AKA Clark Luthor has to be the worst Moral Dissonance in the entire series, and that's saying something. To give you perspective on how evil he was, here's a quote summing him up in his own words: "It feels strange not to have blood on my hands before lunch." Even more baffling, he had done absolutely nothing remotely altruistic to redeem for the countless people he murdered, and showed no remorse for any of it. He even killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his world's version of Oliver Queen at the start of the episode he "redeems."</span> Yet despite all that, Clark Kent feels he just needs someone to be nice to him to bring out the good he's chosen to ignore in his life of murder, and he gets away not only without any kind of punishment whatsoever, but apparently becomes Earth-2's greatest hero.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> has too many examples to list all of them here, but perhaps the worst is their treatment of the Wraith Michael. They kidnap him, subject him to medical experiments against his will to make him human, lost his memory, and mistrusted for reasons he didn't understand, and when his memories returned only to be rejected by the Wraith for having to been human. What happened when he tried to ally with Atlantis to perfect the retrovirus/biological weapon? They turn on him again first trying to turn him human again and then trying to kill him. Michael's crime to deserve this? He is part of a species that biologically is required to feed on humans (and only humans) to survive.

Said article even singles out another fault. The night after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> 2012, AJ booked a rematch between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>, and decided seemingly on a whim to put Ziggler's World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's job on the line. This was bad enough without adding, as the article does, that she told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">Alberto Del Rio</a> earlier in the night that she couldn't name him #1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship because she didn't have jurisdiction over that title, as that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a>'s territory on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">WWE SmackDown</a></em>. Dolph won the match and Jericho went back to Fozzy, but AJ overreaching and almost screwing Dolph out of his dream chance was enough to rile up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a>, who never liked her in the first place, into campaigning to get her fired.
</li><li> There's also plenty of this to find with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a>. The most flagrant example in the former's case came in his feud against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana">Rusev</a> over the United States Championship. The story very obviously was that Rusev was an evil foreign heel and Cena was the All American Baby face, the rationale clearly being that anything that Cena did was good because Cena was the good guy. Which rang a little hollow, as Rusev was practically an anti-villain, whose most evil actions were clobbering a "soldier" plant who rushed him, winning his matches by beating up his opponents, and talking trash in a wrestling ring. The RAW after Rusev beat Cena at Fast Lane, when Rusev's valet, Lana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">interfered in a match he was already handily winning</a>, Rusev was walking backstage on his way out to the ring when Cena stopped him. Cena explained to Rusev that, in America, people have the right to free speech, but if Rusev said mean things about America, Cena would beat him up. Leaving aside Cena's complete lack of understand of what a right is or how they work, what happened was even worse. Rusev did the usual foreign heel schtick of insulting America, Cena ran out and jumped him, beat him unconscious, and then put the unconscious Rusev in a submission hold until a crying Lana agreed to give Cena a rematch against Rusev, for the US Championship, at Wrestlemania. Note: Cena was ostensibly the <em>babyface</em> the audience was supposed to cheer for in this feud.
</li><li> In a backstage segment on <em>SmackDown</em> in late 2007, Kristal Marshall was planning her wedding to General Manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong">Theodore Long</a> and telling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson">Torrie Wilson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool">Michelle McCool</a> that she had chosen them as bridesmaids. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Victoria</a> (who was a heel for most of her WWE career, but highly respected by the fans for her wrestling prowess) showed up and expressed joy that she, too, might be maid a bridesmaid. McCool promptly told Victoria that <em>nobody</em> would ever let her be a bridesmaid, which seemed excessively cruel. What made this worse were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> involved: Victoria could have already been seen as an outsider due to her large size (making her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">"fat"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">"ugly"</a> in the eyes of more petite Divas) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">dark, vaguely "ethnic" appearance</a> (part Turkish, Puerto Rican, and Italian, while Wilson and McCool are both blondes and even Marshall, who's black, has relatively light skin and almost blonde hair), making McCool's bullying arguably not only sadistic but a form of coded hate speech. This is only backed up by the fact that Victoria had been going through a gradual derailment into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> for years which showed no sign of stopping after this segment, and by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LayCool">LayCool</a> run over two years later in which McCool and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla">Layla El</a> would play the "callous bullying full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>" role straight as heels.

Afterwards Whitewolf says the Farstriders are the epitome of valiance and honor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MarvelSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MarvelSuperHeroes">Marvel Super Heroes</a></em> has in place of experience there are what is known as Karma points. which players receive at the end of every adventure chapter if they accomplished mission objective. Heroic characters lose karma by failing objectives or doing heinous things like killing (even villains, even by accident). In fact, characters will lose 'all' their accumulated Karma points if they kill someone, even a villain, even by accident. The game then makes a special exception for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> in the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretWars">Secret Wars</a> adventure who "has no bad feelings about killing in combat. In this adventure, Wolverine suffers no Karma penalty for slaying an "Evil" opponent. Inform the player running Wolverine of this in his first fight. Wolverine will still lose Karma for killing heroes (including Magneto), or for letting innocents die." This exception effectively makes Wolverine a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> character in this game as he doesn't need to follow the most important rule of it. Compare this with more conscientious heroes like Colossus and Cyclops who in the same adventure automatically lose 10 Karma points a day simply because they miss the people they love back on Earth. By making this exception the authors of the game have unintentionally rewarded Wolverine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Heroic Sociopathy</a> and punished other heroes for having empathy!

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One particular example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> tends to portray graverobbers as villainous, but the players robbing the corpses of freshly killed soldiers, and in some cases, civilians, is considered OK.
<ul><li> Of course the guys (Consortium Ethereals) sending the players to kill said graverobbers (Shaffar's Ethereals) are outright graverobbers themselves and are blatantly stated to be sending the players to eliminate the competition. Additionally, at least one graverobber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hangs a lampshade</a> on the double standard:
<div class="indent">Adventurers are such hypocrites! Like YOU just FOUND your weapon on the side of the road!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, the player has the option of hunting down mages or diplomatically talking them into returning to their confinement; equally unfortunately, the option to actually free them only appears once or twice. Hawke is either a mage or sheltering his/her mage sister through most of this. The dissonance is probably intended, and Hawke does get called in this by Anders if s/he is a mage and is opposing Anders' efforts to free mages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has two side quests where you can help people with romantic complications. In Girdershade, Ronald Laren wants you to get him a full case of Nuka-Cola Quantum so he can woo his neighbor Sierra, a die-hard fan of the stuff, and (he hopes) convince her to put out for him. (Even if you do so, she's such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Cloud Cuckoolander</a> that she completely misunderstands his advances and nothing comes of it.) This gives you bad karma. In Rivet City, Angela has the hots for young, celibate acolyte Diego, who has his heart set on becoming a priest. To "help" them, you have to provide Angela with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">pheromones of a mutated ant queen</a> which will make her literally irresistible for long enough to seduce Diego into a one-night stand... and once it wears off, he's kicked out of the priesthood and married off to Angela. Your "helpful assistance" nets you good karma. Help a man give a woman he likes a gift: evil. Help a woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">drug and date rape a man</a>: good.
</li><li> There's also the Tenpenny Tower mission. Roy Phillips is being denied permission to buy an apartment because he is a ghoul, and Alistair Tenpenny hates ghouls. As he storms off, Phillips makes various death threats against Tenpenny, and one of the three solutions to the quest is helping him <em>murder everyone in the tower</em> by unleashing a horde of ghouls into the building. The main reason the inhabitants don't like ghouls is because they think they're all mindless, murderous zombies, which is perfectly justified by Phillips' reaction. Similarly, even if he weren't a ghoul, he's willing to murder <em>everyone</em> in the tower (which includes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> and kindly old man Herbert Dashwood) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">because they wouldn't let him buy/rent a room.</a> For each of the other solutions, you convince the tower's inhabitants to give Roy a chance, and they let him in and give him a room... a few days later, he's murdered all the human inhabitants, and proved their bigotry right <em>again</em>. And if you kill this man who has proven himself to be a psychotic murderer, Three Dog declares <em>you</em> to be a monster and a bigot.
<ul><li> Making all of this even worse, Tenpenny Tower's owner Allistair Tenpenny has a questline where he asks you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">detonate the atomic bomb in the town of Megaton</a> because it's blocking his view; the game considers him Very Evil for this, putting him on par with slavers and cannibals. If the Ghouls take over the tower, Phillips will also want to nuke Megaton...but the game still considers him Good. Throwing it into even sharper relief, Tenpenny specifically wanted to evacuate Megaton's residents beforehand, whereas Phillips is gleeful at the idea of wiping "that smoothskin shithole" and all its residents off the face of the Earth.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Yahtzee</a> points out in his review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">Dead Rising 2</a></em>, the game refers to one of its main antagonist groups as "looters," but at the same time, the player is encouraged to break open ATM machines and acquire wealth to buy Zombrex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(from those same "looters"). At the very least it can be said in Chuck's defense that his motivation for looting is solely to acquire Zombrex for Katey and to aid survivors (or weapons to aid in his survival while finding Zombrex and saving survivors) while the "looters" appear to simply be in it to sate their own greed or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a></span>.
</li><li> A particularly infuriating example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>: early on, you hear about the dwarves inhabiting Hydra Marshes in Home World. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later on, the Hydra is killed by humans, which kills the marshes and drives the dwarves out. Some time later, your party goes to Water Dragon Isle and discovers the dwarves are slaughtering the fairies to give themselves a new home. When you finish off the dwarf chieftain, he calls Serge out on the death of the Hydra, asking why humans can't just live in harmony with other species - <em>never mind that the dwarves just massacred the fairies!!</em></span> One dwarf actually says: "You do not cherish the treasures of nature as we do!" <em>while the ground nearby is littered with the corpses of the fairies they just slaughtered.</em> After you stop the dwarves, do the surviving faeries thank you for saving their lives? Nope, they <em>blame the whole mess on humans</em> for having driven the dwarves out of their swamp in the first place, as opposed to the dwarves <em>who were committing genocide for the sake of stealing someone else's lands</em>. The dwarves even give their big speech about nature, immediately after their <em>battle tank</em> is defeated by the party.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a>: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</em>, when Rumia points out to Reimu that she had seen humans working at night, Reimu explicitly says to Rumia that she can have them for dinner if she really wants. That's not really hero-like since Reimu's job is about fighting youkai to protect humans. As revealed later down the line however, there is a good reason for this behavior. Reimu's job is <em>not</em> to protect humans from youkai, rather she is a sort of manager of balance as well as an enforcer for Gensokyou's hidden rules that normal humans are not privy to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>: When Jedi become player characters in an MMORPG, a certain amount of Moral Dissonance is probably inevitable. Yoda said that a Jedi would use the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack, but in TOR, one routinely sees Jedi hunting down and slaughtering beings that pose no threat to them whatsoever, just so the Jedi can gain experience to advance to the next level.
</li><li> The Paladin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a></em> refuses to smash open a cabinet because it's dishonorable to vandalize other people's property.

</li><li> In Chillingo's <em>Modern Command</em> for IOS and Android, your counter-terrorist organization battles terrorists and dictators to stop them from conquering the world. Nice...but your group often fights by bombarding the enemy with poison gas and napalm rockets (the best and most advanced missile in the game has an ionically-charged incendiary warhead) plus you can use the occasional nuclear strike and ion beam satellite. Your group is also conquering the world and one source of income is charging protection money on the countries you liberate

Only one problem: that completely describes Jack. Even when Jack towards the end of the game decides he is going to play by the book and arrest his enemy, he does so by mowing through dozens of attackers in ludicrous fashion just to get to him.

Though claiming to be a society devoted to achieving peace through individual freedom and personal responsibility, over the ages they found themselves siding with expansionist and dominating powers in their goals to stop the Templars, such as brokering a truce with Ottoman Empire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a></em> which in turn sent Wallachian assassin Vali cel Tradat and the Shia Turkman Shahkulu into the arms of the Templars. This is discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRogue">Assassin's Creed: Rogue</a></em> when Shay asks Liam how can the Order support France during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">Seven Years' War</a> while at the same time they have slaves in Haiti, which contradicts with their creed.

See, one of the main characters reprimands the other for making speeches about what's moral, while still finding the deaths of others amusing. The other soldier denies this accusation, but almost falls to the ground in fits of laughter when his companion points to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">a couple of legs sticking out from beneath the rubble of a ruined building</a>... The moral of the strip turns out to be: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">If you find the deaths of others to be funny, don't reprimand others for</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">their</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">lapses in morality.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em> has an episode where the protagonist Ariel, despite eventually growing to oppose the institution of slavery, evolve some sort of morality and turning to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>, visits a surface colony (i.e. a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Hermione</a> village massacred and taken over) and has sex with her crush. During the blissful after-sex sleep they are woken up to a counterattack by desperate Hermione raiders coming to save their kin imprisoned in buildings who will be sold to slavers. The attackers are defeated, mocked and vilified for trying to save their kin from a lifetime of slavery while Ariel cheerfully ignores the villagers showing the Hermione captives who will be sold to slavers later on. To the earlier episodes where Ariel started to change into a hero challenging decadent oppression of the nobility, it looked like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">episode to show how human subspecies were pitiful compared to Drow</a>.

An act that is immediately inverted when the Galapados leader <em>contradicts the Big Bad's orders</em> to go after them, in order to save the dying Galapados clones.

For instance, in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnBPChgBoGA">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a> pulls out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">lightsaber</a> and threatens to kill his teacher with it.

She wants Silverbolt back so she's going to get him back (there are numerous other issues that also cloud the whole thing, such as whether Blackarachnia was self-aware before she was reformatted as a Predacon, while Silverbolt was undoubtedly a person with a personality before being reformatted into a Vehicon.)

After Breez makes peace with them, a stray gunshot fired by an stepped-on weapon causes the beasts to attack again. This time, the Heroes don't bother with reasoning, instead they kill them all, unhatched eggs included. The end of the episode finds our Heroes celebrating and being celebrated, with Breez joining in on the party.
