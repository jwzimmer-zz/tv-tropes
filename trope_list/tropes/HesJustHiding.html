<ul><li> L; not helped by the fact that this is the point in the story that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">broke the base</a> on whether the series was still good or not.

</li><li> And that's not to mention the deluded fans who are convinced that Light somehow made it. You know, despite having Ryuk write Light's name in his Death Note, just like he said he would in the VERY FIRST EPISODE, which is pretty damned final by the standards of pretty much everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> Though not exactly the most beloved character of the series, fans have hoped that if there's another season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, Precia Testarossa should return. She's noted to be one of the cruelest villains ever in the series (on par and maybe surpassing Jail Scaglietti in Season 3), but the final battle against her doesn't have much action, thus fans wanted to at least have her return and be defeated in a more epic battle. And she'd presumably still be a credible threat even after Nanoha has grown up and grown in skill and power, as the SS-ranked Precia officially had more natural power than any other mage of the modern era. Besides, for her Season 1 death, she just fell over a cliff to a never-touched but interesting world and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">they never really bothered to see if she's dead for good</a>, fueling possible scenarios where she survived and returned with a more insane plan.

<ul><li> Fans of Jiraiya deny that he died, despite the fact that he was impaled through the chest repeatedly, lost copious amounts of blood, had emotional flashbacks reflecting on his failures and accomplishments in life, transferred his knowledge of the enemy to a frog messenger for Naruto, and sunk to the bottom of a lake while his vision faded to blackness. The fan rationale? It was just one of his shadow clones (even though those would disappear after even <em>one</em> of those things happened).
</li><li> Itachi's death was questioned, despite Madara implicitly stating that his body is lying around somewhere by saying Sasuke could have taken his eyes. Made even worse during the winter break of 2009/2010, when he made a "reappearance" which readers could tell was just genjutsu from a mile away. And then completely finished off when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kabuto used Impure World Resurrection, which only works on the dead, to briefly bring back zombie-Itachi</span>.
</li><li> Many fans believed that Obito Uchiha was just hiding, as Tobi of all people. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">He was</a>.</span>

While the way he died made it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">impossible to recover the body</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has confirmed it — as if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyDeadMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyDeadMontage">5-minute montage and monologue sequence</a> wasn't enough. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PS2</a> game <em>Gundam Meisters</em> made Lockon's Death even more explicit, showing Lockon's faceplate crack off, a scene added to the special edition release to further solidify his death as final.
<ul><li> Of course, he was then replaced in the second season with his twin brother who takes on the same code name. Though he doesn't mirror his brother's motivations and (while still a sniper) has a different fighting style.

Anyway, since fans were revolting, he was decided to be brought back, with amnesia. Even his lone helmet in space which was originally shown, was removed, to make his survival possible. The fans did it! (In 00 it didn't work, though.) Whether this was actually a good idea, given that Mu's original death scene was a contender for the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in all of Gundam, is one of the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">base-breaking</a> aspects of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>.
</li><li> The fate of Amuro Ray and Char Aznable at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em> has become a somewhat legendary topic of debate among certain fans of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> franchise. The intentional lack of a definitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> doesn't help to settle this, and whenever the story appears in a crossover game, such as <em>Another Century's Episode 3</em>, the hero Amuro always survives one way or another. Char's fate is often sealed.
<ul><li> The fandom's view, in general, is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersCast">Amuro and Char are dead until Sunrise says otherwise, generally believed to be whenever they think the franchise needs a massive shot in the arm</a>.
</li><li> Of course, the inclusion of Full Frontal in Gundam Unicorn makes some people wonder if Char survived since they look very similar and sound exactly the same. It turns out that Full Frontal was genetically altered to remember Char and programmed with his memories, though. Making him instead a more literal version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a> archetype.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, fans of Spike will swear up and down that the character is just hiding, despite having suffered fatal injuries from a personal nemesis, being surrounded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> from the Syndicate (while <em>in</em> the Syndicate Headquarters,) collapsing in a pool of his own blood, and <em>the entire series leading up to exactly that climax</em>.
<ul><li> Notable in that the guy writing the stuff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">isn't entirely sure if he's dead or alive, either.</a> Some fans have interpreted this as a way of the writer saying it <em>doesn't matter</em> if he lived or died; Spike's story, and by extension the story of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, has ended, and whatever happens afterwards, if anything, isn't for us to know.
</li><li> Given the nature of the Syndicate in question, Spike would <em>be made its new leader</em> if he survived, since he had just killed the previous leader, Vicious, who in turn had assumed power by killing his own predecessors. Spike would be eligible to take command in this manner because he was previously a member of the Syndicate and despite his own best efforts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResignationsNotAccepted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResignationsNotAccepted">you never leave the Syndicate</a>.
</li><li> It really doesn't help that Spike was previously shown to survive a similar scenario (specifically he was shot, skewered, and jumped off of a four-story building), albeit barely, so fans of his survival have at least some ammunition.
</li><li> Watch carefully in the end, you will notice the brightest star disappears, alluding to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> of the Indian Chief has stated that means someone has died. Basically confirming that Spike has indeed died.
<ul><li> Laughing Bull's description of the warrior who died could just as well refer to Vicious as Spike. Every part of the show's ending is supposed to be heavily ambiguous.

The series writer stated the ending was made to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyDeadMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyDeadMontage">Really Dead Montage</a> for Lelouch, however a possibly deliberately misunderstood interview by the series director saying that "the happy or sad nature of the ending is up to the fans" was misrepresented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrug of God</a>, claiming that it meant that Lelouch's death was up to personal interpretation, while in truth what was really said was that Lelouch's death was free to interpret as a happy or a sad ending, but Lelouch's death itself was never open for interpretation. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Bases</a> inside the fandom ensued and often erroneous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a> arguments were used because the anime's lore itself made it impossible for Lelouch to have the code. 10 years later, a sequel was announced with the real Lelouch being confirmed as the protagonist and the official title of the sequel being "Lelouch of the Resurrection". This made it certain that Lelouch was truly dead, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> always stated, and will be resurrected.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>, which means hardly anyone ever dies; as such, any apparent death is generally assumed to be a case of this. Any other fandom would declare them dead. The <em>One Piece</em> fandom insists that no named character has ever died (except for in flashbacks). You can't really blame them, though, because other characters - even fairly minor ones - <em>have</em> come back from worse; after ten years of storyline, the number of named people that are confirmed to have actually died in the main storyline (aside from anime filler characters) doesn't even reach into double digits.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0s47g');"><sup>Namely... </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0s47g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0s47g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mr. 11; the Straw Hat Pirates' first ship, the Going Merry; Portgas D. Ace; and Edward Newgate, a.k.a. Whitebeard. Yes, one of the confirmed deaths is not actually a person...though the ship was very much depicted as a character in its own right. Other characters have suffered seemingly obvious deaths, but only those are confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>though two in the Punk Hazard arc seem to be final even by this trope's standard: Monet, who had her disembodied heart stabbed, and Vergo, who was chopped to pieces and then blown up. The former was survivable since it was via Law's Devil Fruit, but being left in such a helpless position meant Vergo would have been unable to use his normally-formidable defensive powers to survive the explosion.</span>
<ul><li> For instance, Miss Monday and Mr. 9 were last seen making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and getting blown up, and failed to show up in any context for <em>years</em>, but were still assumed to be alive. And sure enough, both are revealed to be alive in Chapter 632's cover story. Not only that, they had a kid together.
</li><li> Gin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to one of the earlier antagonists who developed a friendly relationship with Sanji and Luffy, seems to be fatally poisoned when he's last seen, but he is never shown dying, leading some to believe that he may have survived (although neither he nor any of Krieg's pirates have been seen since the East Blue saga).
</li><li> Bellamy from the start of the Skypiea saga, seemingly a throwaway villain with too much pride and not enough power. He gets on Luffy's bad side and gets taken out with one punch. At the end of that saga, we see him getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a> treatment from his boss, Donquixote Doflamingo, an absurdly powerful and influential pirate who can be considered One Piece's rendition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>. Fast forward about five hundred chapters, and we see him alive, well, and significantly more mature, with only a scar to hint at his punishment.
</li><li> Gekko Moria of the Seven Warlords of the Sea made the mistake of challenging the Straw Hat Pirates. The last Warlord who made an enemy out of them, Crocodile, had his plans ruined, got beaten to a pulp, and imprisoned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">Impel Down</a>. Moria suffered the former two fates. Later, after the War of the Best and his less-than-satisfactory performance, Doflamingo comes after him with a small army of cyborgs, each akin to The Terminator, the top brass of the World Government having ordered his execution. He escapes, allegedly with his powers, but Doflamingo claims that he was injured too much to survive. Obviously, he was wrong; not much is known about Moria's current status, but what is known is that... He's Just Hiding, somewhere in the New World. It's implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Absalom</a> used his powers of invisibility to help Moria escape.
</li><li> Another particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example is Nero, a very minor character who had just enough screentime to get his butt kicked by Franky. He was thrown off a speeding train. Into the ocean. In the middle of one of the biggest, most powerful storms in the world. And he was unconscious at the time. And also horribly wounded. Fans assume he survived. They're probably right.
</li><li> The Alabasta arc has two egregious examples of this. First, Igaram is caught in a massive explosion that converts a galleon to scrap-wood, mourned over for the entire arc, and then wanders back in at the end to be supportive. Even worse, Pell carries a bomb with a reported blast radius of five kilometers, which was supposed to kill every living thing in the capital city, high enough into the sky that it doesn't even char the buildings; he's not only caught in the blast, he's actively carrying the thing (and doing nothing to defend himself). After that, he must have fallen the, oh, <em>three miles</em> to the ground. He walks back to the capital on crutches, apparently with no permanent injuries, and in fact wearing the same clothes, which are hardly dirty. In the anime, he walks up to his own tombstone, showing that his friends quite reasonably thought he was dead. And when we see him again one saga later, he's perfectly healthy. Both cases ruin a perfectly good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
</li><li> Bentham, better known as Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, has fallen under this trope twice, both times as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to help Luffy and his allies escape. The first time, he and his crew face off against a crew of Marines, and his boat is destroyed. Later, a mini-series in the manga shows that he survivedbut was incarcerated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">Impel Down</a>. The second time, after Luffy's break-in of Impel Down, he alone stays behind to make sure everyone else escapes. This has him facing down a ton of guards and the prison's warden, Magellan, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson">Venom-Venom Fruit</a> powers had let him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp</a> just about anyone who challenged him, including Luffy himself. Heck, Magellan had effortlessly sent Luffy to death's door a few chapters prior. But much to the delight of the fandom, it's revealed post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, in chapter 666 (make of that what you will), that he somehow survived and is now the "queen" of the secret sanctuary in the prison.
</li><li> Sabo. Luffy's brother. Only seen in a flashback involving Luffy and Ace's past, and seen having his raft bombarded at the end of that flashback, with only a tattered hat at sea to indicate his fate. This being a flashback, he was eligible for real-death even under the usual "rules". Many, many fans insisted that he was still alive (and a member of the Revolutionary Army), even after his death was confirmed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">One Piece Databook</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And as of Chapter 744, it's finally been confirmed that they were right on both counts. Well, sort of on both counts; he's not just a member of the Revolutionary Army. He's <em>second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army.</em></span>
</li><li> Oda seems to counterbalance this by killing off people by the truckload in flashbacks. From heroic doctors to beloved mothers to whole pirate crews and the entire population of an island, flashbacks are infamous not only for their body counts but for the deceased never ever coming back...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">except for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">Brook</a>, that is.
<ul><li> And Franky, who only survived by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">rebuilding his body with iron.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the biggest example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is Ulquiorra. Fans saw his body disintegrate, but they still cling to the hope that he'll come back. The fact that his death was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">touching and poignant</a> doesn't help matters. Other notable cases include Szayel (he is just that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>), Starrk (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a> + capacity for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a>). and Harribel (negates the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">bridge drop</a>). Some would be tempted to put Grimmjow on here as well, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredSurvival">he wasn't exactly dead the last time we saw him.</a>
<ul><li> Fans of Ulquiorra have even more to be worked up about now. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> pointed out in an interview how surprised he was by the worldwide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">response to Ulquiorra's death.</a> He refused to confirm whether that was the last of Ulquiorra.
</li><li> Gin Ichimaru is theorized to be alive by some based on his fan-favorite status, the fact that he was still alive when he was last seen (his last words in his head were "great, now I know I can leave things to him," but it's not made clear if he means he can trust Ichigo to take down Aizen after his death or after he's no longer in any condition to fight), and the fact that Orihime showed up just a few chapters after his apparent death. There's also the fact that after the saga is over, Rangiku laments that Gin is gone, but never mentions if he's dead or if Orihime <em>did</em> heal him and he just took off somewhere.
</li><li> Recently, Kaname has been added, with some fans suggesting that Mayuri is working on reviving him for...some reason.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Genryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto.</span> There are numerous theories about how he could have "faked it," including reviving himself as a zombie, being stored in his Zanpakuto somehow, and collaborating with AIZEN, of all people. All of these ignore that, even if he was just hiding, Soul Society really, REALLY needs him, and he's not there. The Kyoka Suigetsu theory sometimes counters this with Aizen is doing it as a practical joke. Yeah. One other thing that often gets cited is the statement that "no body was found," but this is because it was vaporized onscreen.
<ul><li> Szayel in a separate chapter was shown to be in hell. Ulquiorra and Starrk were confirmed as dead in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Unmasked</a>, which is considered pretty definitive. Gin was later confirmed as dead in the Germany Interview.
</li><li> But it turns out that Harribel really <em>was</em> Just Hiding - Orihime healed her (and her Fraccion) off-screen, and she's mentioned after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. Guess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a> realised how stupid killing her off so anti-climactically was...
</li></ul></li><li> As of the latest arc, Byakuya Kuchiki can be added to that list. Ever since his apparent death, many people have denied it. Granted the chapter where he apparently died just came out so this might be a little premature, it still counts.
<ul><li> Nope, Byakuya as of the latest chapter did in fact survive. Though it also has people rolling their eyes at Kubo since it's just another example of him refusing to kill off his dear soul reapers. Kenpachi survived the ordeal too, but his survival is at least somewhat justified due to the guy beating him turning out to be a complete fake of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> What was so aggravating about Byakuya surviving was that there were multiple points where it was indicated that he had died (i.e. Haschwald saying he'd died, Byakuya giving a farewell speech to a murderous Ichigo and finally his Zanpaktou falling down and breaking with a shot of him having so-called "final thoughts"). It's jarring to see it was just cheap drama.
</li><li> On the other hand, all of this is pretty standard for a fake-out death in Bleach. The things we've seen that generally confirm a character's death are the destruction of the body, decapitation, and/or not appearing again for many chapters after being declared dead.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Maria Ross in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> turned out true in one series, but false in another. The least spoilery way to put it.

He gets shot in the back, but we don't see the shot actually hit him. They call it Denial Day, and it's November 8th (or 9th).
</li><li> There are a number of fans who don't want to believe that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pride</span> killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his son Selim</span> at the end of the 2003 anime. It's cited that he just strangled him, though a cracking sound can be heard that implies his neck was broken.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a> covers a multitude of sins. In the case of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> fandom and General Cross, this includes disappearing from a room several stories above a lot of sharp rocks, leaving behind the cracked, bloody remains of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask">Cool Mask</a>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a> (which is no longer attuned to him), and more blood than a human can lose and survive, all of which was confirmed to be his. That said, there's still one hell of a lot of mystery surrounding his death/disappearance, since, well, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> fans keep hoping very much that Purgstall will come back from the dead. He was a commonly suggested suspect of Appolyon's identity.
</li><li> Akai Shuuichi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> is an interesting example. Immediately after his death, people declared him to be alive, due to the numerous inconsistencies around his death, as well as some notable differences between two shots of the body. Even though that, due to this, there was never much of a doubt in the community that he wasn't dead at all, there are a lot of arguments on <em>who</em> he is - is he Scar Akai, who looks just like his mirror image, but seems to have lost his memory?

</li><li> This trope is also the reason he has been so enthusiastic about being offered the chance to write "Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?", which, like how Alan Moore's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow">Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</a>?</em> is the "last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> story" before the retcons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> took place, is the "last Batman story" for the retcons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em>.

</div><ul><li> Not much later, Chase returns and says that that is <em>exactly what happened</em>. Molly points out that this was exactly what she said, and asks why the others aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">awesomed</a> by her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>: Rorschach wasn't killed by Dr. Manhattan! Jon just teleported him somewhere, the blood was just a decoy to throw off Adrian! Also Captain Metropolis and Hooded Justice. Hooded Justice's death is highly ambiguous, though it seems Nelly officially died in a car crash. However, a popular theory that the pair are in truth alive and together may be confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
<ul><li> The strongest evidence supporting the theory that Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis are alive and well is in Chapter 1, page 25, middle-left panel. In the restaurant, two men are holding hands and are the focus of the panel. The main characters, Dan and Laurie, are in the background. This technique is sometimes used elsewhere in the work, for example, page 14 of chapter 10 where the intent is to transfer the reader's attention from the main characters to a new character (in this case, Roy Chess). The men resemble older versions of Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis, assuming Justice is the strongman. A final detail is their bow-ties. Their ties have green markings on them, making them resemble domino masks. While the other indicators are rather vague on their own, the addition of the bow-ties seal it for some. And given that Hooded Justice and Metropolis died in ways that leave bodies difficult to identify, were gay lovers, and resemble the drawn men who steal the focus of the panel, it could be true. If you really want to get crazy, Laurie's dialog ("Me and Jon? Oh, yeah yeah, everything's fine. Couldn't be better.") that is present in the panel could be juxtaposed purposely with the men and the relationship of HJ and Nelly. Laurie and Jon's relationship is public, with no privacy, physical intimacy or affection, while HJ and Nelly's was secret and private, and the two men are obviously very intimate with each other. Or it's just a load of crap.

Since there was no evidence that there was never a real Laurel, fans believe she's still out there. And many years later in <em>Superman/Batman</em>, writer Chris Roberson introduced a new version of Superwoman named Elna Kent in the 31st Century. Not only does she look like Laurel and have a similar costume, but "Elna" was an alias Laurel used in her debut.

Had young fans come to terms with the death of their hero somehow, the world of the Transformers might have been a very different place.
<ul><li> Prime's death in the <em>G1</em> movie had such a profound effect, it actually caused an aversion in another Hasbro toy-based movie; protests over it caused the creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeTheMovie">G.I. Joe: The Movie</a></em> to turn Duke's death near the end into a coma. Which is even more ironic when you find out that apparently, the idea to kill off the leader originally came from the guys writing the GI Joe movie. The Hasbro execs liked it so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">as a way to clear old stock off of shelves</a> that they suggested the Transformers movie do the same.

<ul><li> This is also an in-canon rumor about the single, unnamed SAW Viper who notoriously killed four Joes before being hunted down by Snake Eyes in revenge.

The fact that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a> <em>and</em> he makes several cameos in the questionably-canonical animated series doesn't help matters any.

Despite his being dead, there were a few hints that Scar, even after his Heartless was defeated, still lived on as a ghost hive and later the Earthshaker, and he might have even created a Nobody of himself as the result of his transforming into a Heartless, going by several heavy implications of what happens to people when they become heartless. Plus, if what is implied to have happened to Master Xehanort/Terranort after <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is anything to go by, destroying both his heartless and nobody would most likely bring Scar back to life.
</li><li> The same treatment is often given to Zira and less often Nuka and Mufasa. Zira dies by falling into a raging river and being trampled by logs, but it's vague enough that fans say she could have survived.

<ul><li> Discussed in-universe in the manga adaptation where Tadashi was sucked into a portal during a failed attempt to bring Abigail back. It's theorised that he could still be alive in another dimension.

Since it's implied they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">never retrieved their remains</a>, many theories exist that they survived. <em>Why</em> they have been missing for three years varies, with two popular choices being either they are on an abandoned island or they have amnesia. The director of both movies, Chris Buck, jokingly said they washed up on an island with their new baby, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan">Tarzan</a></em>.

(Or better yet, accidentally shot by a passing clonetrooper. In slow-mo.)

According to Lucas, the only reason he didn't add the scene was that it didn't seem necessary when most of the fans already believed he survived anyway.
</li><li> Aayla Secura, a very minor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">in the films, anyway</a>) Jedi killed onscreen during the Order 66 sequence, has attracted speculation that she may have survived.

</li><li> The official <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> board had a joke movement saying that the background character <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/San_Hill">San Hill<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is still alive and well because he is never shown being killed in the movie and his body isn't there after Anakin kills the Separatist council. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> by a continuity manager squashed this, though this doesn't explain the appearance of <em>another</em> San Hill (but a human one, not a muun) in the same position in the game <em>Forces of Corruption</em>.

The EU book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsTarkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsTarkin">Tarkin</a></em> dropped a couple of details about the enigmatic figure into the canon also helped the theory gain some support.

In this case, it wasn't so much a matter of making up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanonical</a> ways that he could still be alive (being impaled through the chest with a giant wooden harpoon being a fairly definitive death) as pressuring the filmmakers to go back and change the movie's final sequence to have Wash survive somehow ("he can just be trapped offscreen during the final battle!"), as though it would have been possible/cost-effective to bring back the entire cast and crew, remake the final thirty minutes of the movie, and have it ready for the movie's September release, which at that point was three months away.

Of course... he <em>is</em> an android in the first place and the movie did hint at Data's possible rebirth through his brother B4, so it's slightly more believable than a lot of other instances of this trope... even if it will never happen in canon (Brent Spiner himself has said he's getting too old for the role).
<ul><li> This has achieved a sort of quasi-canonicity now, with Data's "resurrection" through B4 being a plot point of a new comic book miniseries which bills itself as "the official prequel to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">new Star Trek movie</a>". While comics are not considered canon in <em>Trek</em>, this certainly has some weight as it's written by Kurtzman and Orci, who wrote the screenplay for the new film.

<ul><li> While there is definitive proof that Quicksilver is down for the count, many wondered if the character will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">stay dead forever</a>, especially when taking the character's shared film rights into account. It's also worth noting that the actor has signed a multi-film contract, so it's not impossible that they're planning to bring him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> later down the line (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">it wouldn't be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">the first time</a>).
</li><li> Ultron. Seriously, if you've got an army of drones and you can hide inside any single one, then why not let two slip away with one acting as a decoy? The fact that the film does not outright show Vision destroying him has only added fuel to this fire.
</li><li> Baron Strucker is killed by Ultron barely halfway through the film, but in the comics, the character has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">a history of surviving seemingly-fatal incidents</a> which could be carried over here. Also, the actor signed a multi-film contract before filming started on this movie just like Aaron Johnson as Quicksilver, so it's not impossible we'll see them again.

<ul><li> Nobody, <strong>nobody</strong>, who had any knowledge of the superhero genre believed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the characters snapped out of existence by Thanos</span> wouldn't get resurrected, despite the claims of some people connected with the films that they were absolutely permanently dead, not a hoax, not a dream, not an imaginary story, no do-overs.

</li><li> On the other hand, fan reactions to the other deaths in the first film got it completely wrong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loki, who was assumed to be coming back due to his trickster nature and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped a Bridge on Him</a> aspects of his demise, is still dead unless the alternate timeline version who escaped with the Tesseract ever gets followed up on. By contrast, Gamora gets resurrected via time travel, despite the emotional weight with which her death was framed signalling that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a></span>.
</li><li> There are a lot of fans who think that, given <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thanos' vision of Gamora</span>, the characters who were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrificed to obtain the Soul Gem</span> might be in limbo somehow and resurrectable. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> in <em>Endgame</em>, when Hulk reveals that he tried to bring back Natasha, who also sacrificed herself to retrieve the Soul Stone, when he performed his own Snap, but it proved impossible.</span>
</li><li> Any of number of fans still think it's possible that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tony Stark</span> could be resurrected as early as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em> despite the aftermath of his death explicitly being a driving presence in that movie alone.

</li></ul></li><li> Harvey Dent/Two-Face in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>. He wasn't moving after he hit the ground and there was a funeral, but some fans say that they "saw him breathing" after his fall. The fate of the character was addressed in an interview where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronEckhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronEckhart">Aaron Eckhart</a> revealed that Harvey did in fact die and that he had to ask the director if the character was really, truly dead from the fall. This, of course, has led to fans pointing out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">possible loophole</a> that while <em>Harvey</em> might be dead, <em>Two-Face</em> might have survived.
<ul><li> A lot of the speculation was likely also because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger">Heath Ledger</a>'s death left a void in what would (presumably) have been the main villain of the next movie, leading some fans to believe that Two-Face's death might be retconned even if it had been intended as final. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">As it happens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Nolan himself confirmed</a> in an interview that had Heath Ledger not died, half the plot of the third Batman movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">would have</a> involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Two Face</a> going on a rampage through Gotham while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> stood trial.

Admittedly the film's designated Ghostface Jill includes her in the roll call in the hospital, but she wasn't around when it took place and it's reasonable to presume she only assumed it went according to plan, as everything else had up to then.

Ron remains unconvinced even after Hermione pointed out that what would have had him survive, well, pretty much the same things that killed Dumbledore, required stunning leaps of logic. The nail in the coffin for the trio comes when Harry sees his magic eye implanted in Umbridge's door but that itself doesn't fully prove his death. Out-of-universe, some fans point to a briefly glimpsed one-eyed beggar as evidence Moody may not be as dead as he seems.

</li><li> Although the reaction was not as large, a large number of Snape fans believe that the character is still alive (secretly) after the final book. Normally the fan suggestion is that he would have left the country due to a lack of reason to stay and the antagonism that would have remained around him even if Harry fought for his name to be cleared. The most frequent evidence for Snape being alive are: a) he did not appear immediately in a painting in Hogwarts on the wall of dead Headmasters the way that Dumbledore did (something that has been explained by Rowling as him leaving his post without dying or officially retiring), b) the fact that he was a Potions Master with an extensive knowledge of poisons and antidotes, c) that Arthur Weasley survived multiple bites from the same snake in an earlier book, suggesting the venom is not fast-working, and d) that because there was no immediate spurt of blood the snake did not actually pierce the jugular.
<ul><li> The film adaptation adds an additional wrinkle to the death scene by having Voldemort also use the Sectumsempra curse, which itself is lethal in time. Regardless, this death stands out because Snape almost certainly could have been saved with sufficiently quick medical attention, and also because it's the only time Voldemort has ever been shown to kill someone without using the Avada Kedavra curse.

Of course, since they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a>, it turned out that he was just hiding with the Dalai Lama, having somehow won his death-struggle by means of a mastery of "Baritsu, the Japanese system of wrestling".

<ul><li> There are people out there who still think Eddard Stark is alive... Somehow... Without his head...

</li><li> Two words: The Hound. There is even sufficient evidence that he <em>is</em> still alive, unless Martin is pulling a gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxshadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxshadow">dick move</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that The Hound is dead.

<ul><li> There's also the matter of the fake!Hounds. Brienne, even knowing that Sandor is "at rest," refers to Rorge and then Lem as "the Hound" in her narration after they each appropriate the Hound's distinctive helmet. This gives more support to the idea that "the Hound" is only a title/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a>-situation, an identity which has now become detached from Sandor Clegane himself.

</li><li> Syrio Forel. Given how he easily disarmed several armed men using a stick and his actual death wasn't shown on-screen, some deny his death, even going so far as to claim he's actually Jaqen H'ghar. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says he's dead, that men-at-arms are one thing and a well-trained Knight of the Kingsguard in full plate armour is something else entirely.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">Fate of the Jedi</a></em> has an inversion: Because of it being released either after or around the same time as the Legacy era comics (which has Luke Skywalker as a force ghost), several fans were speculating that Luke Skywalker might end up dying by the end of this book series. However, he did not.

Because the author died before completing the book, the intended resolution is unknown and subject to much speculation. One theory is that the character Dick Datchery is actually a disguised Edwin.

<ul><li> Of course, she has no way of knowing that he was resurrected less than an hour later.

Due to his previous manipulations (writing himself into flight rosters to get the flight bonus without actually flying), Doc Daneeka is recorded as having been inside of a plane that crashes. He's marked down as dead, and the administration refuses to correct the error, even though he is standing right in front of them, clearly alive.

Even after the body was found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer">Oathbringer</a></em>, some fans expected her to return, with some assuming that the spren that followed her sister around after she found the body was actually her soul. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> that theory, confirming that Eshonai is definitely dead and not coming back.

Whedon later stated that, even though neither of those theories panned out, he likes that she stayed dead because it sent the message that Willow could still find love and move on with her life.

The WB's website was advertising Spike joining the cast of <em>Angel</em> the same day that <em>BtVS</em> aired its last episode, if not before.

<ul><li> Fans were quick to notice that if Danny had the opportunity to return to the living world two weeks after his Cyberman body was killed, similar means could be used to resurrect any other character killed in the episode. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Especially Missy</a>.
</li><li> Fans are also adamant that Missy killed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">Zygon</a> and not the real Osgood. Ingrid Oliver, Osgood's actress, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02b9fpy">certainly liked to think<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> her character's just hiding! The following season, it was revealed that <em>either</em> the real Osgood <em>or</em> the double was killed, and the surviving one won't say which is which for purposes of maintaining the human-Zygon peace.
</li><li> Missy had been using her disintegrator device to blast people into a cloud of fine red dust left and right. It seems kind of odd that the same device disintegrates her into a cloud of fine blue dust instead, not unlike her teleportation earlier. To this, many point out that the reasoning is because the device itself wasn't used to disintegrate her, with it instead being the Brigadier's Cybermen artillery that did the job. That said, Moffat himself enforced this trope with his comments immediately after the episode aired, noting that he hoped Missy would emulate Anthony Ainley's Master in reappearing without a scratch after getting involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a> situations. She reappeared at the top of Series 9, in fact.
</li><li> Since Seb isn't actually alive, but an A.I., it's unlikely he would have been "killed" by Missy. This, in turn, provides a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> regarding Osgood's survival.

In the finale, Clara was extracted from her timeline one heartbeat before her death, and was effectively "put on pause"  she can travel for a very long time before her death, but must eventually return to it, because it's a fixed point in time. And she still can't come back as a companion, because she and the Doctor got too dangerous together.

However, her actress Sharon D. Clarke was announced as playing a "returning role" when she was revealed to be involved with Series 11. Thus, there are a few possible options speculated by fans and reviewers: 1) this was misdirection to avoid spoiling the climax; 2) it's technically true as Grace will reappear in flashbacks or a trip back in time, 3) this trope: she will be somehow resurrected and return. Of course, it could also be 4) she's impersonated by some kind of alien entity. It turned out to be (4) in a single episode, but other than that she's just dead.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in-canon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> with the apparent killing of Xhalax by Crais in Season 3. To avoid killing Xhalax in front of her daughter Aeryn, Crais takes her off into the swamp and there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath">Sound-Only Death</a>. A couple of episodes later, we see an apparent flashback in which Crais makes a private deal with her and spares her life, but then it's comically revealed to be a paranoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> on John's part. Then a few episodes after that, it turns out that Crais really did spare her life.
<ul><li> Speaking of Crais, a sizable part of the fanbase believes he and Talyn both actually survived their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in season 3, and that they actually <em>did</em> StarBurst away.
</li><li> Zhaan gets this as well, with many believing she safely escaped through the wormhole. This was particularly fueled by comments by Stark following Talyn!John's death, in that he heard Zhaan's spirit calling to him on the planet they were visiting.
</li><li> You won't find <em>anyone</em> who believes that D'Argo actually died in <em>Peacekeeper Wars</em>. The fact that the similarly-left for dead Sikozu and Grunchlk <em>did</em> turn up alive in the comic continuation add fuel to that fire.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of the 1990s revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flipper">Flipper</a></em> featured a man convinced that his dead son was alive and would return home "soon". He went so far as to buy a present for each birthday his son missed, saving them all for the day the boy would come back. He was rather creepily casual about the whole affair, acting as though the fact that his son has been missing for years was absolutely nothing to be concerned about. Surprisingly for a family-oriented show, the son did not turn out to be alive and the episode ended with the man learning to move on.
</li><li> Few if any fans really believed Joe Carroll was killed off in the first season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFollowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFollowing">The Following</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The first promo for season two pretty much confirmed that he's still alive.</span>
</li><li> With the second season opener of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em>, many people are suspecting/hoping this about Charlie. Some have several reasonable reasons for how it's improbable for the shape-shifter to have killed, body-copied, hid the body and clothes-swapped in the confined time. Wither this remains as a plot hole, red herring or foreshadowing is up in the air. It doesn't help that one of the first series episodes, heavily featuring Charlie, was held back and became part of the second series. Leading to him turning up again with no explanation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several fans think that about Jon Snow, who was stabbed by the Night Watch in the finale to the fifth season. The fact that his actor is returning, and that a poster for the sixth season shows his face helps the theory out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turned out to be true, as he was resurrected in the second episode of the sixth season by Melisandre.</span>
</li><li> There was also a significant belief that Stannis getting beheaded by Brienne at the end of Season 5 was a fakeout due to the scene cutting the second Brienne swings her sword. This lead to both the writers and the actor confirming no, he's definitely dead.
</li><li> Catelyn Stark. In her case, it was initially justified, as she actually was resurrected in the books. However, both her actress and the showrunners have confirmed they have no intention of adapting that storyline into the show, and by the end of season 6, the story has long since passed the point where it would make sense for her to return. Nevertheless, some fans still hold out hope that someday we'll see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Lady Stoneheart</a> on <em>Game of Thrones</em>.
</li><li> Many fans believe this about Ser Brynden Tully, aka the Blackfish. Though he supposedly died doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> against the oncoming Lannister and Frey forces at Riverrun, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen">lack of an onscreen death</a> and the Blackfish's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">well-known fighting abilities</a> convinced many that he somehow escaped again. Further fueling this speculation is that in the books, the Riverrun plotline ended with the Blackfish escaping the Lannister forces by jumping in the moat and swimming down the river.
</li><li> The series finale has Drogon pick up the stabbed body of Daenerys Targaryen and fly off to parts unknown. Some fans were quick to posit that he'd take her to Kinvara, a member of a priesthood capable of resurrecting people, <em>and</em> firm supporter of Daenerys.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em> all that was found of Abigail Hobbs was her ear, and it was cut off while she was still alive. This led to (usually not very convinced themselves) suggestions that Hannibal let her go. There is also the even more dubious suggestion, only offered as a joke, that Miriam Lass is still alive too and just missing her arm.
<ul><li> Surprisingly, the one about Miriam Lass turned out to be <em>true</em>. Hannibal cut off her arm and had been keeping her captive since.
</li><li> In <em>Naka-Choko</em>, Freddie Lounds is implied to have been killed by <em>Will</em> and offered as meat for Hannibal to cook. However, fans are holding out for her to be alive and hiding as part of Will's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to oust Hannibal.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> Even though it wasn't a case of a truly major character, the death of Rousseau on is an example. Even though she was shot, her corpse was later found in a shallow grave, <em>and</em> a guy who talks to dead people heard her voice there were still people online trying to come with survival scenarios.
</li><li> Michael and Jin were both on a boat when it exploded. The latter was shown to have survived in this explosion. The former's fate is still up in the air.
</li><li> But Jin was on the deck and could've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">jumped ship</a>. Michael was next to the bomb when it exploded.
</li><li> In what may be a subversion, many fans of Lost took the close-shot of Ethan's corpse and the motion of his breathing (which appears to have been a goof) unnoticed by the Losties as a casual foreshadowing that the character would come back. While he featured frequently in flashbacks after the episode of his death, he never made his return in the "present day".
</li><li> Another example would be Rose who, in season one, refused to believe her husband had died in the crash. Come season two...
</li><li> Frank Lapidus was thought to be just hiding when he went down with the sub. Turns out, he was.
</li><li> And then there's the time the Smoke Monster punted Richard into the jungle with no mention of whether he was okay or not until the series finale.

Jane's actor also hints at this in a pre-season interview explaining the premise of the fourth season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's quite a bit of "Kate is not dead" fanfic, despite her death being caused by sniping. To the <em>head.</em> There are some crazy theories like some are suggesting a body double. The reason for the body double? So that Kate and Ari can run off and elope.
</li><li> There's also a huge amount of "Jenny Shepard is not dead" out there, and the prevailing theory is that she faked her gunfight death to continue her rogue activities unhindered before her disease kills her. Lending credence to this is the fact that the storyline about her dead father (who she thought was alive and in hiding, and <em>could</em> very well have been) didn't have a definitive ending.
</li><li> And now there's the same speculation regarding Ziva David, supposedly killed in a bombing at the end of Season 13. It helps that the death happened off-screen, viewers never saw the body, and that TPTB have been vague (apparently intentionally) about whether or not she's truly dead). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The episode "She" seemingly confirms she's alive but in hiding to protect her family.</span>

Despite her being shot and pronounced dead on screen, the campaign immediately started insisting that <em>she</em> was now alive in witness protection, citing the lack of blood (which is mainly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">it's that sort of show</a>).

One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/OrphanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/OrphanBlack">Wild Mass Guess entry</a> theorizes that, since Helena and Sarah are identical twins, Helena has the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">self-repair gene</a> that Sarah's daughter Kira appears to have.

But, since there was an episode in Season 2 where the Professor fought his double, many fans speculated that the "real" Professor was still alive, and the evil Professor had travelled with the heroes for a year before being killed off. It also seemed possible that Jonathan Rhys-Davies would reappear as another version of the Professor. IIRC, many years post-cancellation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> finally stated that it was the evil Professor who slid (and died).

Luckily for the protagonists, the real Ansem is a good guy...to the point that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, he performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to jeopardize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plan.
<ul><li> Turns out, Ansem the Wise survived that, and, as of Reconnect: Kingdom Hearts, is in the dark realm, memoryless, meeting up with Aqua.
</li></ul></li><li> Although Scar was killed in <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, the fact that he became a Heartless shortly after his first death and retained his regular form, as well as the heavy implications that an equally strong Nobody would be formed in the process strongly implies that we haven't seen the last of Scar just yet, even after his Groundshaker form was destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>: Vergil's last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canonical</a> appearance saw him outright exploding. His sword and part of his powers were passed down to his spiritual successor in the fourth game, further indicating that he's probably gone for good. Despite this, some fans still insist that he's just hiding or 'in hibernation.' According to this theory, soon his consciousness will awaken within said spiritual successor, and he'll manifest as an energy-being, and then he'll get a material body again. DMC 4 made it clear that wasn't Vergil's body that exploded. It's was either his soul or a false body that his soul was trapped in.
<ul><li> And then Dmc V showed Vergil alive and retaking Yamato to heal himself. There is no real explanation for how he was still alive to begin with.
</li><li> Not just the case with Vergil; let's look at Sparda. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">narrator</a> from the first game stated that he died, Arkham in the third game's manga stated that he died, but for some reason the fans insist that he's only "disappeared" (and is likely to return one day), basing it on a misinterpreted line in <em>2</em> or Modeus's musing in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries">animated series</a>. No one ever bothers to answer the question of just <em>what</em> Sparda might be doing if he did simply just vanish.
</li></ul></li><li> A fan theory exists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a>: Geneaology of the Holy War</em> that after the first generation was massacred, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Ayra</a> still lives and just wanders off to places unknown. Even after being rebuked at the sidequel (<em>Thracia 776</em>), whereas survivors of the massacre were gathered together and turned to stone, which may possibly include her. Fans still don't buy it and merely list her as "just wandering off". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">"Because she's just too badass to be turned to stone"</a>, or so they say...
<ul><li> There's a similar theory for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester">Gheb</a>. Gheb is rumored to have a double Gleb who took his place when he was killed. Gheb's far too handsome to die.
</li><li> Might as well latch onto the fact that in FE 10, it is possible to be "too badass to be turned into stone", and apply that to a totally different universe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>:

They were just gravely wounded. <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> reveals that Soap not only survived but has been promoted to Captain and will essentially be taking Price's place as the badass squad leader who mentors the player. Whether this was the <em>developers</em> saying "he was just hiding" (not to mention what became of Captain Price) remains to be seen, but so far no one's been complaining.
</li><li> Price is also back in <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, and he &amp; Soap survive the events of the game. Still no word on Gaz or Griggs, but things aren't looking too bright in that category.
</li><li> And as of MW3, Soap MacTavish is on the "just hiding!" list.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em>: Bella Goth could be called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat">Schroedinger's Hottie</a>, being considered dead despite her family tree portrait not being shaded-out, and being able to be summoned up through means both legitimate and illegitimate (such as sending Alexander to college with Mortimer dead). Also, of course, there's the situation with her having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">Doppelgänger</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PSP</a> Sims 2 sequel features her (or a version of her), and explains where she's been. (Abducted, and now in hiding, since you asked.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, the ending is just ambiguous enough to support both the theory that Ramza and Alma (at least, but may extend to the rest of the heroes) escaped Murond Death City and lived out their lives in hiding; as well as the theory that they never did.
<ul><li> Bah, the chocobo Ramza was riding dropped a feather in the river, which subsequently left ripples. Unless it was a ghost chocobo dropping ghost feathers in a ghost river, they lived.
<ul><li> This is actually a rare <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a></strong> of this trope, as fans insist they died in spite of being seen alive, and their chocobos drinking water.
</li><li> However, it's a very ambiguous finale, and there are many problems with them being alive. For starters, they were last seen in the middle of a gigantic explosion. While it's true that these aren't always fatal, much less has killed other characters, with an arrow killing Teta, Delita implying that he only survived an explosion because her body blocked the force, and dying in combat actually being lethal in this game if you aren't revived quickly enough. Even if they did survive, they were floating in the middle of nothingness, and the portal back to Ivalice had been explicitly destroyed earlier. Say we assume there was Deus Ex Machina like the explosion ripped a hole back into the real world. Why would Ramza and Alma have fled from Olan? He was one of the few allies that Ramza had. In fact, why didn't Orlandu, Olan's adopted father, ever come back for him? Why would they have visited their own graves at all? If they decided they couldn't clear their names, where exactly would they go? By the end of the game, Ramza has all of the knightly orders, the church, and random brigands hunting him relentlessly, and Ramza's family wasn't much liked in the other kingdoms. While he does seemingly disappear during the timeskip, his brother and the church never really lost track of him, they were just observing him. If he could start a new life so easily, then why didn't he come to Olan's aid when he was captured by the church and burned for the crime of heresy? As for the infamous water-drinking Chocobo, there is no immediate evidence contradicting it, but it wouldn't be the first time that impossible circumstances were used in a Final Fantasy game for symbolism. In the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, bodies are often shown dissolving into Lifestream, despite it being canon that corpses are left behind.
</li><li> The circumstances of their survival are very improbable, yes, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that Ramza and Alma, as well as everyone else in the party, did in fact survive.
</li><li> Almost every player who still discusses that missed the point. Sink or swim, Ramza, Alma, and all their followers were branded heretics midgame. In a medieval setting, which, true to how it happened in real life, were executed with extreme prejudice, if not downright having their bloodied bodies <em>paraded</em> across the kingdom to set an example. And of course, the fact that the final boss whose explosion originated from, the most dangerous of all Zodiacs, who <em>would</em> destroy the planet if left unchecked, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">a goddess that everyone and their liege worshipped</a>. So yeah, the ending wasn't about if they survived or not, but how every single person whose life they saved wouldn't think twice about skewering all of them <em>on a single pike</em>, for deiticide. Which brings this trope to full circle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">they ''have'' to be hiding in order to live on such a world.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Before the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a>: FES</em>, many fans claimed that the Main Character hadn't died in the end (despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">100% HP cost</a> from The Great Seal and that he just fell asleep for no apparent reason...) Needless to say, they were all pissed off by "The Answer".
<ul><li> The lyrics for the song "Memories of You" at the end of the game pretty much confirmed his death before FES was even in development.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> fans applied this to Goro Akechi as during the plot events of vanilla, he seals himself behind a door in Shido's Palace with his doppelganger in an apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> as is never brought up again outside of being briefly mentioned by Lavenza and Sae, due to the sound editing and Akechi's popularity amongst the fanbase. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Persona 5 Royal</a></em> confirms that he did survive his "final battle"... only to later reveal Akechi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">days are numbered</a> from having been brought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> by Takuto due to the protagonist's regret of being unable to save him during the events of Shido's Palace. Given that Akechi (or at the very least someone resembling him) appears in the True Ending cutscene, and some seeming incongruencies in the mechanics of Maruki's power, this trope still applies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> fans found Big Boss' death to a cigarette lighter and aerosol can at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em> was too cheap and anticlimactic a death for the series' greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a>, given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelatedBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelatedBackstory">Belated Backstory</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> (not to mention surviving The Fury's flames from his flamethrower, which was stated to use Rocket Fuel to have the fires burn much longer, and surviving being near ground zero of the ICBMG's launch).

<ul><li> Big Boss dies again in MGS4, along with his comrades Eva and Ocelot. However, given these characters massive popularity, fan theories have cropped up by the hundreds claiming that all three are still alive and well and their supposed 'deaths' were just a way of hiding themselves from the various militaries and governments who want to abuse them.
</li><li> Solid Snake himself has this trope in an odd way... The ending of <em>MGS4</em> pretty much outright states Snake will die and very soon. But, he doesn't technically expire within the game itself, leading some to assume that Snake lives on in spite of his body's decline. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> adds to this by having Raiden only talk about Snake in the present tense.
</li><li> An in-universe example happens in <em>Peace Walker</em> when it's noted that Paz landed in the ocean in her presumed death, the body was never found, and she had been wearing SCUBA gear at the time of her defeat. So it's quite likely she's still alive, and the trailers for <em>Ground Zeroes</em> confirm she is alive.

There is plenty of fanfiction involving Lara travelling to Avalon/Helheim to find him - despite the fact that one cannot choose to go to Avalon in death, and people who are there are turned into soulless thralls.

Tina runs a role-playing game for the four original vault hunters, and she seems to be in complete denial that one of them is dead. When the others finally confront her about this, she admits that she understands the truth, but she doesn't have to like it. The game is her way of providing a better ending. In fact, she kills two birds with one stone, bringing back another character who had died in the main plot so they can save the day at the last minute.

</li><li> When Gordon Frohman died in the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Concerned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Concerned">Concerned</a></em>, you could see tons of messages full of grief, rage and hatred on the comic's forum, most of them written without any regard for spelling or, for that matter, the comic's subtitle: "The Half-Life and <em>Death</em> of Gordon Frohman". (Maybe that's because, in their opinion, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">killed off anticlimactically</a>.)
<ul><li> The reason for this is more that Frohman apparently went from living to dead <em>without taking damage</em>, which can't happen in the game.
</li><li> It was so pervasive, that recently, a fan created a comic titled <em>Concerned 2: A Concerned Ripoff-The Continuing Adventures of Gordon Frohman.</em> In the first strip, Frohman was revived by <em><a class="urllink" href="http://aconcernedrip-off.webs.com/apps/photos/photo?photoid=11205247">Reloading from the last checkpoint<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.</em>

Before her death, the author had stated that she would remain in the story for most of its run, so while he could have changed his mind, there is at least that.
<ul><li> This differs from the norm for this trope in that nobody denies Miko is dead (OotS's format makes that impossible, as any character who dies has their eyes turn into a pair of "X"s), but many in the fandom expect her to come back anyway. But then, OotS <em>does</em> take place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">world</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">death need not be permanent</a>, and where coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> is so routine, the heroes have actually recommended imprisonment over execution for a recurring villain because they figured his eventual resurrection was more likely than his escape from jail.

This was despite the fact that her dreambot was clearly shown being destroyed, and, you know, having <em>a goddamn moon</em> dropped on her. Thankfully, Andrew showed the corpse shortly after and clearly showed and referred to her as dead, putting an end to this. She came back anyway.

None of which has stopped fans from speculating that she might still be alive.
<ul><li> The show has parodied this a couple of times. On one occasion, a character's insanity manifests itself as the belief that "Kate" faked her death. Another time, a character suggests that William Griffin faked his death (despite the body having been found), prompting another character to comment on how unlikely that would be.

<ul><li> In v3 many handlers suspected that the characters killed off in the inactive clearing were still around Faking The Dead and plotting against the terrorists. However, this was actually proven to be canonical. In v4, some handlers have speculated that the STAR escape group did not die in a fiery boat explosion as the terrorists claim, but for now, they're treated as dead by most people.

In particular, regarding the deaths of Lopez, Alpha!Church, and the original Tex. The arguments for Lopez and Tex are fairly reasonable (Lopez did mention having backups, and it's never explicitly said the original Tex "died" anyway), but the justification for the original Alpha!Church is a little more contrived, especially because his death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">has been confirmed by the creators.</a>

<ul><li> The show was initially light-hearted but gradually introduced darker elements until turn abruptly dark in Volume 3.

The Grimm was immediately thrown into an explosion and the airship they were on crashed into the city below. The creators confirmed that Roman is gone and survived past the intention of being only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">pilot episode</a> villain due to fan popularity. This has not stopped fans from theorising different ways for Roman to survive and return to the show.

That didn't change the fact that many fans couldn't accept her death and have created all sorts of theories for how she could survive and return to the show. Including the idea that her personality could be downloaded into a robot to replace the sentient robot, Penny, that the villains tricked Pyrrha into killing just a few episodes previously. The fan response was so strong that the character's voice actress tweeted confirmation that Pyrrha's death had been planned from the character's very conception. This should have been obvious from the outset, when one looks closely at the origins of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">her name</a> (Pyrrha, for King Pyrrhus of Epirus, who won a series of unsustainable victories against the Romans, and Nikos, being derived from Nike, the Greek goddess of Victory. Ergo, Pyrrhic Victory)
</li><li> Penny's death contains a variation. Fans didn't react the same way to it as they did Pyrrha, in large part because Penny isn't human. Penny is a robot so fans assume her death won't be permanent. They'll fix her and she'll appear in a future volume just fine. As of Volume 7 Penny is indeed back and has been stated by her father that as long as her core is undamaged she can't really die.

<ul><li> Addressed in one of the comics, the Fire Nation had put Air Nomad relics into circulation, and set up bases in various mountain chains, until they ultimately found or lured in every last escaped Airbender and killed them.

</li><li> This even applies in-character; when Aang is told that the Air Nomads were wiped out, he is initially insistent that the Fire Nation could never have accessed the Air Temples, and suggests that they've been in hiding for the last hundred years.

The second time was in "Inqueling", where Inque's daughter stabs her in the back by giving her a solvent-laced cure to dissolve Inque. Batman then meets up with the daughter, and she mentions that Inque's dead, and Batman merely replies that "[Inque's] been dead before" prior to leaving.

As of the sixth season, Jonas's demise remains "off-screen" from everyone's point of view, as far as we know, so there is room to wonder.

<ul><li> A disquieting number of people believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors">Jim Morrison</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur">Tupac Shakur</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> actually faked their own deaths. This is so common for Elvis that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives">it's a trope unto itself</a>.
<ul><li> The fact that Tupac is somehow <em>still</em> releasing singles, and has put out more material posthumously than during his lifetime, does help their case a bit.
</li><li> Of course, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankieBoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankieBoyle">Frankie Boyle</a> pointed out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> <em>might</em> have something of a hard time hiding out after his "death." B.I.G. as well.
<ul><li> In MJ's case the sheer amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">dedicated impersonators</a> would probably get people to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit">assume</a> he's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">a really good tribute artist</a> if he went out in public.
</li></ul></li><li> And a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> episode: "Wait till I tell Tupac about this! Oh- um..." (awkward silence) Jack: "I didn't hear anything."
</li><li> The notion that Tupac is still alive was spoofed in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/cio5rg/chappelle-s-show-tupac-is-still-alive---uncensored">skit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MostlyHarmless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MostlyHarmless">Mostly Harmless</a></em> has Elvis singing in an out-of-the-way alien bar. For the record, he wasn't abducted by aliens — because he left willingly.
</li><li> Hilariously carried on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, when some bikers in a bar are playing a trivia game and come across the question of when Elvis died. It turns out the one with the control for the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death himself</a>, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse">Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a>, who states that he never laid a finger on him. Of course, he never gets any of the answers associated with deaths wrong. It turns out that Elvis is working in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool">Burger Lord</a> as a short-order cook.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a></em> provided this answer: "Elvis is not dead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">he just went home</a>."
</li><li> And then there is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BubbaHotep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BubbaHotep">Bubba Ho-Tep</a></em>, where it was actually an Elvis impersonator who died. Elvis himself lived to a ripe old age.
</li><li> A Kit Kat <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5Tgn-HBxg">advert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the 1990s showed a figure wearing Elvis' trademark outfit watching a news report about this trope. He eats a Kit Kat and says, in full Elvis accent: "I'm not dead baby, I'm just having a break."
</li><li> Even an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em> showed Elvis as one of Alan Matthews's poker buddies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic">No one seemed that impressed.</a>
</li><li> Elvis is alive and well in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSookieStackhouseMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSookieStackhouseMysteries">The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Sort of...</a>
</li><li> Elvis is alive and well on Marshall's paper route in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EerieIndiana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EerieIndiana">Eerie, Indiana</a></em>.
</li><li> Elvis is alive and well as the ruler of a "secret underground rock 'n roll beach kingdom" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> has mentioned meeting Jim Morrison at a random gas station. When asked why he wasn't dead, Morrison replied "Don't believe everything that you read", before driving off. King put the unnerving story in the mouth of one of his characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Of course, we might as well mention the most famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> inversion, too: Some people believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> is dead based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">"evidence"</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' songs and album covers.
<ul><li> Some people believe McCartney <em>faked his death</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated">The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated</a>."
</li><li> Similar to this are the rumors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> being cryogenically frozen. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">being installed onto a spider mech that hungers for Cuban children.</a>
</li><li> As many as half the members of the Lubavitch Hasidic sect believe that their long-deceased spiritual leader, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson, touted late in his life as the Messiah, is not really dead. Rather, they claim, he has been mystically "concealed" and will return to fulfill his mission. A much smaller number of Lubavitch messianists have claimed that Schneerson was actually an angel in human guise, or even somehow equivalent to God.
<ul><li> And then there was that other Jewish fellow, two thousand years ago...
<ul><li> Subverted, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">said fellow</a> has been stated explicitly as having died and been brought back to life. However, this trope is often offered as an alternative explanation for his return by those who reject his divinity (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Muslims</a> and Unitarians) or the supernatural in general.
</li></ul></li><li> And the Twelfth Imam, who is believed to be in "occultation" until the day of Judgement.
</li></ul></li><li> It turned out that the long-lost author of the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedSeries">orphaned</a> 1970s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Wormy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Wormy">Wormy</a></em> <em>was</em> just hiding, having dropped comics work altogether and gotten a job as a taxi driver, trying his damnedest to sever any connection to his previous work.
</li><li> Some people thought that Amelia Earhart succeeded with her attempted world flight and assumed a different identity afterwards.
<ul><li> There is a book of short stories in which one featured Amelia as an Orthodox Jewish girl who'd always longed to be a pilot. She eventually achieved her goal, but then realized how much she was missing out on, faked her death, and lived out the rest of her life in Bnei Brak or similar.
</li><li> <em>The Autobiography of Santa Claus</em> has it that she faked her death so that she could go to the North Pole and become one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">Santa's immortal helpers</a>. So did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun">Attila the Hun</a>, and a few other people, as well as St. Nicolas himself, who basically left a fake body behind him so that people would think he died in his sleep.
</li></ul></li><li> It's worth noting that for a while, people believed Napoleon had actually faked his own death to escape prison. His ultimate fate? A glasses salesman back in France.
<ul><li> Michel Ney, a French Marshal, was executed after Waterloo as an example to the remaining generals. Some legends have it that he escaped to America, some even say that he had Freemasonic ties and received help from Wellesley, who also was a Freemason.
</li></ul></li><li> The legend that Dmitri, the alleged son of Tsar <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvanTheTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvanTheTerrible">Ivan The Terrible</a> who somehow escaped death and went into hiding, was responsible for decades of chaos in Russia called the Time of Troubles, as there were multiple pretenders claiming to be him that sought to claim the throne when the Rurikid Dynasty died out. And some anti-Bolshevik Cossack leaders who disappeared after the end of the Russian Civil War, it turned out, really did just go into hiding as they came out after the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union. Their stories did not end well.
</li><li> D.B. Cooper, who stole more than $250,000, before leaping off an airplane, with a parachute. The FBI is still uncertain if he's alive, but since part of the money he stole washed ashore, it's generally assumed that he drowned. Apparently, Agent Cooper of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> is based on him and is partly this trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a>, according to some, faked his death in order to escape his rapidly ballooning fame, retreating into the mountains to meditate and train.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitchHedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitchHedberg">Mitch Hedberg</a>'s death was questioned, due to the fact that his death was ironically announced on April Fool's Day.
</li><li> Many Rastafarians believe that Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia didn't die <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">and returned to Heaven</a> until the right time. Or simply that he isn't dead.
</li><li> The Nation of Islam apparently believe that former leader Elijah Muhammad and founder W. Fard Muhammad aren't dead and have instead ascended on a high-tech craft <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> refer to a UFO. Apparently, in it, they can extend their lives well beyond 100 years...
</li><li> There were Nero sightings throughout the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire for about a century after his death, with people believing either that he had somehow survived, or had come back from the Elysian Fields to usher in a new age of imperial greatness.
<ul><li> And then there were early Christians, who honestly thought Nero was so evil that they expected he was the antichrist and would return from Hell to bring about the Apocalypse. This can partially be explained by the fact that early Christians read a character in the Book of Revelations as referring to him; his death, therefore, put a crimp in their readings of its prophecies.
</li></ul></li><li> Many, perhaps mostly Nazis, have believed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> to have been alive long after 1945. Whether anyone <em>still</em> believes it is a mystery. If he is alive then he's the oldest man alive and is over 120 years old. We might be safe. All depends on how long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic">a human brain can keep in a jar</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Or putting his brain in a Great White Shark</a>.
</li><li> More serious theories concerned Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann, and the leader of Gestapo, Heinrich Müller, who both disappeared near the end of the war. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann escaped to South America, while others theorized that he was actually a Soviet agent. In 1998, it was confirmed that Bormann died in 1945. Probably so did Müller, but this is still not confirmed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> talked about faking his death from cancer, but decided against it — not long after that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">he was actually diagnosed with cancer</a>. Because so much of his work was based on making people wonder if what he was doing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">All Part of the Show</a> or not, a lot of people thought his illness was another elaborate hoax, and some still think he didn't actually die in 1984.
<ul><li> Conversely, it also wouldn't be out of character for Kaufman to want people to <em>think</em> he had faked his own death when he did actually die. Yes, meaning he'd <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">faked</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">faking his death</a>.
</li><li> It didn't help that Kaufman himself stated that if he were to fake his own death, he would return 20 years later. His friends threw a "Welcome Home Andy" party on May 16, 2004, which Andy curiously did not show up to.
</li><li> It also didn't help that Tony Clifton (Kaufman's abusive lounge singer character) managed to continue touring after Andy's death. It would probably be more of a puzzler if not for the fact that the entire point of the Clifton character was to present a fictional person as if they were real, and to convince people that it WASN'T simply Andy Kaufman by occasionally having someone else play the role and confront Kaufman on stage, because then there wouldn't be an easy explanation for how a fictional character could survive the death of their actor.
</li><li> In short, Kaufman was such a master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> that he's still got people confused 25 years later.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is one of the most common when dealing with monarchs linked to an old lost cause. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">sleeping in Avalon till the motherland needs him again</a> to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Grand Duchess</a></em> Anastasia and other members of the Russian royal family, the examples are countless.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyMays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyMays">Billy Mays</a> didn't die; he faked his death because he wanted to start a new life at the North Pole.
<ul><li> Some other people have claimed that he grew angry with civilization, faked his death, and moved to Wuhan, China and then created the COVID-19 virus to teach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket">the millions of monochrome moron humans</a> a lesson.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ViktorTsoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ViktorTsoi">Viktor Tsoi</a> fans also refuse to believe he really is dead, preferring to say he "went out to smoke", and graffitis saying ЦОЙ ЖИВ ("Tsoi is alive") are a common sight. Since Tsoi is hit <em>hard</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeAversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeAversion">Hype Aversion</a> on the Internet, this is mocked a lot by Russian netizens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a></em> by Russian rapper Alexei "Guf" Dolmatov. Back in 2011, his death was reported by a few publications, with different accounts of how this had happened. Seeing how Guf still releases tracks and tours, this is quite definitely a hoax. Didn't stop "Guf died" from entering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme lexicon</a> at the time.
<ul><li> In 2012, Guf recorded a track with that title, a pretty tongue-in-cheek reply to his then-fresh memetic fame. It also featured Basta, who was reported to be dead around the same time (not as famous for that though).
</li></ul></li><li> There are people who genuinely insist that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> didn't die. Forget the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK">most theories regarding his death border on the insane</a>, there are mountains of evidence (mostly logical and scientific in nature) that suggest that yes, JFK DID die on November 22, 1963. Not to mention that it would be pretty hard for the president of the United States to run away and live a normal life. Which makes me question why these people don't just latch onto the many theories regarding his death.
</li><li> Many adherents of Scientology believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> didn't die. Instead he "voluntarily left his body" to go travel around the universe. Many of the centers keep a writing desk for him, should he ever return.
</li><li> There are so many premature obituaries that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> has a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries">long article about them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This actually <em>was</em> the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheTourettesGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheTourettesGuy">The Tourettes Guy</a>, who was largely believed to be dead for two whole years, even by the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thetourettesguy.tv">official website's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> owner. The official website now claims he was in prison the whole time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">mentions nothing about the death rumors at all</a>.
</li><li> Richey James, depressed, self-harming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers">Manic Street Preachers</a> songwriter disappeared on the 1st of February 1995, and his car was found near the Severn Bridge. It was pretty obvious he had killed himself, especially considering his mental health and the fact he never reappeared but was only pronounced dead in 2008, having been classed as a missing person for the past 13 years.
<ul><li> Considering that he had allegedly bought books on how to disappear, and had withdrawn the maximum possible amounts off of his credit card every day for a week before his car was found, it's not as far fetched an idea as it first appears...
</li></ul></li><li> It's died out some now, but after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger">Heath Ledger</a>'s death in 2008 a lot of people honestly believed it was faked as a publicity stunt for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>.
</li><li> As with many other famous people, there are theories about how Richie Valens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>, and The Big Bopper are alive. This was parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> where a flashback hints that two members of the Council of 13 of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion">Guild of Calamitous Intent</a> are actually The Big Bopper and Buddy Holly and the plane crash that "killed" them both was faked.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> drummer John Mayhew vanished somewhere between <em>Trespass</em> and <em>Nursery Cryme</em> (he played on the former but had been replaced with Phil Collins by the time of the latter), never even collecting most of his royalty cheques for <em>Trespass</em>. For years rumours circulated that he'd died or fallen extremely ill. He turned up in the 90s, alive and reasonably well, having moved first to Scotland then Australia and taken up carpentry; in the mid-2000's he was actively giving interviews and even put in an appearance drumming with a Genesis tribute band, before returning to keeping a low profile. When his brother went looking for him in 2009, he found out he really <em>had</em> died earlier that year, of a heart condition.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>'s "higher power" storyline there was some speculation that the Higher Power would turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianPillman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianPillman">Brian Pillman</a>, with their "death" being a publicity stunt. Some fans thought that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> would show up at Survivor Series 2005, which was the week after his death.
</li><li> A disturbing number of people (particularly amongst those sympathetic to him) think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama bin Laden</a> is still alive and that reports of his death were "propaganda."
<ul><li> Even larger amount believes that he had been dead for a long time and reports about it were postponed for a better time, politics-wise. Both opinions probably take fuel in same...details in reports. One could say that his corpse has been just hiding, for these people.
</li><li> Some people think he and Saddam Hussein are still alive on free vacation on Island with help from the CIA. Seeing as both bodies have been photographed dead, this is rather stupid, but conspiracy theorists never let facts get in the way of a good time.
</li></ul></li><li> Some people think Israeli PM Yitskhak Rabins assassination is not quite what the authorities tell them, as some details dont entirely add up, and a considerable portion of what the Shabak did beforehand is still classified.
</li><li> Tenrikyo followers believe their prophet, Nakayama Miki, concealed her human form and still lives on. They still bathe her and feed her and read the newspaper to her; how they do it is not known, as its performed only by the Shinbashira (hereditary elite Tenrikyo clergy), which is a cause for a serious amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>.
</li><li> Because of the lack of information about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Versailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Versailles">Versailles</a> bassist Jasmine You's death in 2009 (the only information released to the public was that he died of an unspecified illness), there are a few people who believe that he faked his own death for whatever reason—maybe it was a publicity stunt, or he wanted to retire from the music business without being pestered to return, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">he secretly identified as a woman and wanted to get a sex change without publicizing it</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">he returned to his home planet</a>.
</li><li> A rather different example, but this principle applies to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_species">Lazarus taxa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_fossil">living fossils<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, species of organism presumed to be extinct that pop up much later in the fossil record.
<ul><li> Many believe that several "extinct" species, like the Thylacine, are still alive in small numbers.
<ul><li> Then there's the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory-billed_woodpecker">Ivory-billed woodpecker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Some people have had difficulty accepting the proposition that mankind is capable of driving species to extinction. For example, when the passenger pigeon (the most populous bird in the world in the 19th century) was driven to extinction in the early 20th century, some Americans suggested the birds were not really dead, but hiding in Chile.
</li><li> The Princes in the Tower. Despite the most popular theory about their disappearance being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Richard III</a> murdered them, there are still ideas that they escaped. Pretenders to the throne tried to capitalise on this, claiming to be them.
</li><li> Pretty common with famous criminals/outlaws like John Wilkes Booth, Jesse James, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, even John Dillinger. Either they faked their own deaths or, in Dillinger's case, the murder was staged to save authorities the embarrassment of letting them escape.
</li><li> A persistent theory about Tsar Alexander I — who talked about giving up the throne and living as an ordinary man at several points in his life — is that his sudden death in the remote town of Taganrog was staged and that he spent the rest of his life as a wandering hermit named Feodor Kuzmitch.
</li><li> Edward II's younger brother, the Earl of Kent, attempted to gather a rebellion to rescue him from captivity and put him back on the throne - over two years after his funeral. He got a surprising amount of support, considering, and was beheaded for his trouble. This plays into the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieschi_Letter">theory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Edward escaped and lived out his days as a monk in Italy.
</li><li> When his beloved youngest daughter Princess Amelia died in 1810, George III went mad with grief, one of his delusions being that she wasn't dead, but merely went to live in an estate in Hannover.
</li><li> Maria Feodorovna, the Dowager Empress of Russia, never accepted that her son, Tsar Nicholas II, and his family was killed by the Bolsheviks, believing they were in hiding. There was a persistent faker who went by the assumed name Anna Anderson that pretended to be the youngest daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidAnastasiaSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidAnastasiaSurvive">Anastasia</a>, until her death in 1984. She never convinced any of Nicholass immediate family but some extended relatives bought it. There were some people that tried to clam they were the only son, Alexis, but she also never bought it because he had hemophilia and theres no way he could have survived the injuries he would have sustained.
</li><li> Mexican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bandito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bandito">bandito</a> Joaquin Murrieta was reportedly killed by the California Rangers in 1853, but there were and are stories claiming that they got the wrong man and the real Murrieta lived to a ripe old age.
</li><li> Russian rapper Detsl has gone on record saying in an interview that he wanted to fake his death at the age 35 and go into hiding on a remote island. He died in 2019 at the age 35, so naturally that interview began circulating on the internet, with a vocal group claiming that everything went according to the plan.
