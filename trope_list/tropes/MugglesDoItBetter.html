</p><p>Except, sometimes, the superhuman devices or abilities in the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">aren't really all that earthshaking,</a> at least not compared to the more mundane methods available. Sure, being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">create fire with your mind</a> might be neat, but if it's not on a large enough scale, you might be better off with a handheld lighter. And a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickArrow">Trick Arrow</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">that electrocutes people</a> could be useful, but we <em>do</em> already have stun guns. And that guy saying he'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> now that he's got skin as strong as steel?

Of course, if they don't work, there's always the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption">Nuclear Option</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes the usefulness of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggle</a> methods will be a big part of the story, like Van Helsing using modern scientific methods against vampires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931">Dracula (1931)</a></em>. Other times supernatural abilities and Muggle abilities will be kept largely separate thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, but when they do intersect the superiority/equality of Muggle methods will be clear. And then there are some stories where it's clear the writers didn't really think about what ordinary people could contribute, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">the fans certainly will</a>.
</p><p>There are two ways this trope can go if it isn't used correctly. In some cases, it applies if and <em>only</em> if the Muggles are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">A girl who freezes you at will</a> may be able to kill regular soldiers easily, but if they have insulated suits specifically to fight her, well, then it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">a teenage girl with a useless power vs. a squad of heavily-armed, trained soldiers</a>. And one-sided fights aren't very entertaining. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Usually</a>. On the flip side, it can become unsatisfying fast if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in and critically-thinking viewers recognise that the only reason the Muggles win is because the supers are holding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Balls</a>, suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisappliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisappliedPhlebotinum">Misapplied Phlebotinum</a> and using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">embracing the true potential available</a>. For example, smart audiences may wonder why supers do not use guns when muggles do. Trying to get this trope to work well may involve a delicate balancing act. In fanworks it can result in something similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryWank">Alternate History Wank</a> in which the "wanked" party is the Muggles, and as such the term "Mugglewank" is sometimes used by detractors.

See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedWeakness">Weaponized Weakness</a>, when muggle methods are used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation">exploit</a> an already dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>.

Also a key characteristic of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>, who utilize such methods in a way to keep up with (and sometimes defeat) the other superpowered beings of the universe.

</p><p>Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">Kinetic Weapons Are Just Better</a>, which is when mundane weapons work better than fancy shiny phlebotinum-powered weapons, though not necessarily as sometimes the "mundane" weapons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells">pretty phlebotinum-loaded too</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernMagik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernMagik">Post-Modern Magik</a>, which is when technology and magic intertwine. Also compare to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>, as this trope assumes the supernatural is locked in such while the muggles continue to advance.

The Pharaoh did, as did Aki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>, and some could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeThemToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeThemToo">see and talk to Duel Spirits</a>, but that was about it. (Kaiba might have had a few remnants of the magical skills that his past self as Priest Seto had, but couldn't use them at will.) Still, they tended to fight and defeat sorcerers, demons, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> on a regular basis.
</li><li> One of two people to defeat the Pharaoh in a duel was Yugi himself in what was likely the greatest duel in the first series. Just a few episodes before that, Yugi had defeated Yami Bakura without the Pharaoh's help.
</li></ul></li><li> The exact premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate">Gate</a></em>. Powerful Empire from a fantasy world sends the conquering army through a magical gate which leads to current day Japan. Said army hits policemen and then the Self Defense Force, and falls back very shortly afterwards. Then Japan's Self-Defense Force goes through to fantasy world, and the inhabitants are <em>horrified</em> by what humans can do to them with simple machine guns and mortars. And after that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">tanks, jets and APCs show up</a>. Luckily for them, Japan is seeking for a diplomatic solution, rather than simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curbstomping</a> the entire realm.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em>, Saitama <em>thinks</em> he's this trope: he's a former salaryman who, in a world full of superpowered heroes and villains, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">relentlessly trained his body to be at the peak of human performance</a>. The namesake of the series, Saitama inflicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> on all sorts of supervillains with the barest minimum of his full power. However, Saitama's strength is <em>far</em> beyond what is logically feasible for humans, and the amount of training he did is at a level many people in real life do without being able to effortlessly kill supers in one punch. This is somewhat explained in that it wasn't merely Saitama's training, but his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">willpower</a></em> in relentlessly striving to become the strongest hero in the universe that ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">breaking</a> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">God Limiter</a>.
</li><li> This is initially <em>averted</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, where humanity is barely capable of holding out against Titans despite possessing early firearms, which for the exception of heavy artillery pieces with exploding shells, are completely useless against Titans, and 3D Gear. The only infantry weapon to be truly effective against Titans is barely able to even the fight and even then unless the soldiers are extremely skilled, killing even a single Titan often means sacrificing several men and women. Only when Eren gains his Titan Shifter powers does the humanity have any real chance to fight back against the Titan threat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, in the world outside the Walls and Paradis Island where technology has been improving at a steady pace, the Kingdom of Marley, which has relied almost entirely on Titans to maintain their military supremacy, becomes increasingly threatened by its more technologically-advanced rivals, who have developed industrial-era weapons specifically designed to kill Titans. In the latest chapters, these weapons are shown to even be capable of destroying the almost impervious Armored Titan.</span>
</li><li> Minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>. Tohru and Kanna mention that Earth's vegetables and rice are superior to what is found in their world due to some magic called "selective breeding".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>, magic is so ubiquitous and widely practiced that defense and detection mainly revolve around locating areas of high magic concentration. For the most part, this works, because almost all offense is created through people's magic reserves. Said defenses and detection are completely ineffective, however, against actions done through non-magical means. This gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> Asta a bigger leg up than most people who meet him suspect, as everything he does cannot be defended against or detected with magic. For instance, the seemingly unstoppable Kirsch Vermillion, who immediately spotted all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster">Xerx's</a> traps and disarmed them, falls into a pit that Asta dug completely through manual labor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>: Saika's children have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, but it is inefficient (they can't communicate with other children, only their mother), and most of them are very confused when they are first born. They gained a lot of coherence and stability once they discovered the Internet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PlusSizedElf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PlusSizedElf">Plus-Sized Elf</a>:</em> In Elfuda's magical world, all meals are extremely basic with no cooking techniques beyond grilling or boiling existing, seasoning as simple as salt and pepper are extremely expensive, and the elves' vegetarian diets consist of nothing but raw vegetables. As such, Elfuda and the rest of the female cast prefer Earth food due to its much wider array of choices.
</li><li> The eponymous creatures of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte">Parasyte</a></em> initially seem impossible for humans to kill, being able to shred people at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParryingBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParryingBullets">deflect bullets</a> with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a>.

<ul><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarshalLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarshalLaw">Marshal Law</a></em> comics sends superheroes back to World War I. They turn out to be pretty useless to the war effort. The idea that superheroes aren't all that useful in actual combat is in fact a recurring theme of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em> spends a good chunk of the war between the Fables of Fabletown (living in the real world) and the Adversary (what they ran away from) showcasing the advantages mass modern technology has over magic.
<ul><li> And a highly-effective-seeming and entirely magical plan for taking out Earth is dismissed when it's explained that modern "mundane" technology would not only quickly pick up on the plan and foil its later stages, but invite a devastating counterattack that the Adversary's forces wouldn't have a prayer against. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A magical plague would get isolated by the CDC and equivalent organizations, and the mundane nations would react to it, well, exactly the way they'd react to any attack by a weapon of mass destruction.</span>
</li><li> To be fair, the Adversary had kept any magics that could be useful against a technological attack under lock and key, was poorly prepared for an attack within its borders of any kind, and never bothered to come up with counters to technology despite knowing about the Fables. All of which are called out on when the Fables start attacking. Magic itself still has many advantages over modern technology and the more powerful magical beings are basically gods that can destroy worlds including a Djinn strong enough to lift aircraft carriers.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite often, one of the reasons for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed Richards Is Useless</a> trope is that superhero super-science is somehow less practical than real-world science. This can take the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">Unobtanium</a> materials, devastatingly high expenses, or a user interface so terrible that only geniuses can use the device - but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">usually isn't explained at all.</a>

</li><li> A long-standing question in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> is why Sentinels are a threat to mutantkind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> has demonstrated a penchant for using his powers and scientific genius to construct incredible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupervillainLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupervillainLair">Supervillain Lairs</a> inside active volcanoes or on asteroids, and even uses robots himself from time to time. But for some reason, he never seems to consider countering human Sentinel technology by simply building his own comparable battle robots. Perhaps because the Sentinels have an alarming track record of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">almost as big a danger to normal humans as they are to mutants,</a> and Magneto is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> enough to fear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">Turned Against Their Masters</a> scenario. He might also morally object to creating a slave race if the anti-Sentinels would be sentient.

An alien race to attempting to conquer the Earth, and all of the world's superheroes were powerless to stop it. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> called the Hornet snuck onto the main ship and got the aliens to leave peacefully.

He only saved Earth by making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>.
</li><li> Something of a central theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBoys">The Boys</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first American superheroes prove useless against the Wehrmacht in the Second World War, the G-Men (X-Men expies) are handily wiped out by Red River personnel armed with machine-guns and flamethrowers.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> has an odd relationship with this trope. Typically, heroes that handle massive cosmic threats will often run into problems dealing with an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> being the most famous example. The trope is often subverted with superpowered threats to the whole planet, which typically require someone with powers to stop them. So, muggles are better at dealing with muggles, and superpowered heroes are better at dealing with superpowered villains.
</li><li> The "Final" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HackSlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HackSlash">Hack/Slash</a></em> ends with this, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cat Curio manages to whip up an antidote to Akakios's slasher-creating potion in a few days in her own lab</span>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack">I Want My Jet Pack</a> trope comes into play here a lot. Many superhero universes are filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> types who have invented assorted means of portable artificial flight. These will almost invariably be used only by Muggles, with super-powered heroes who should technically have access to such technology never using it themselves (villains on the other hand...). The apparent assumption being that if your natural power set does not include flight, then you have no business flying without some kind of vehicle. A notable exception being the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, although they are from the distant future.
</li><li> One Bronze Age <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a></em> story involved an extradimensional warlord magically stealing the U.S. army's equipment. When he steals a nuclear warhead, Dr. Strange gives him a magical vision of the horror such a device can unleash, and he's so aghast that he returns it and all the tanks and such and wants nothing to do with them.

</li><li> Of a sort in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a></em>. The title character's Hell-based powers are capable of incredible things, however, he operates most of his series with a fixed amount of power that, if he uses it up, will send him to Hell. Spawn delays this inevitability by using guns, bombs, and other mundane weapons, which usually are powerful enough to take out Spawn's foes. So magic is better, but muggle weapons won't ultimately send your soul to Hell.

Medical examiners and pathologists are said to be looked down on by the rest of the Wizarding world due to their association with death. There's only one ME for all the British Isles and Ireland, and Eddie had to be brought in from San Francisco because nobody local wanted the position after the last one retired. Furthermore she examines bodies for both magical and muggle causes of death, and wears scrubs instead of robes because the latter are outdated and unhygienic.

The upside to this is that they can do magic without wands or Latin-sounding invocations (though they later discover that a properly attuned wand is an excellent focusing tool) and can make up new spells as needed just by focusing their will, and their abilities don't set off magic-detecting alarms. This gives them several very solid advantages over traditionally trained wizards. They also have the advantage of wider Muggle schooling and Muggle technology, as wizards are woefully ignorant of anything outside the wizarding world.

Harry notes that one of the advantages guns have over wands are that they're quicker to use, though wands are far more versatile. One particular example stands out when Harry finds an (enchanted) firearm in Arthur Weasley's study, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">he quickly divests of his guardian</a> on the grounds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace">Arthur put the gun to his own head</a> and <em>squeezed the trigger</em> (Thankfully, tragedy was averted at that point). Arthur mentioned this one in particular had a self-cleaning charm and "some sort of conjuration in the handle." Harry sneaks off in the next chapter and tests it in the forest, initially intending to use up all the ammunition and render it harmless. He spends almost a minute shooting the ground before he realizes that he's fired the pistol over <em>thirty times</em>, revealing that the conjuration enchantment effectively gave it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">unlimited ammunition</a>. Turns out that combining magic and technology can achieve some very interesting results that neither could accomplish on their own.
<ul><li> Later on, the Weasley twins decide to consult Harry on <em>mundane</em> pranking methods, reasoning that in the Wizarding World, everybody's on the lookout for a cursed handkerchief, but nobody's likely to notice a bucket above the door.

While ship girls are indeed superhuman and nearly immune to small arms, heavy weapons are still very much a threat. Excellently illustrated at the end of chapter 167; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Abyssals have just steamrolled the Combined Fleet, but when friendly air support shows up, the hitherto invincible Aircraft Carrier Water Demon</span> is told to retreat under the belief that, as powerful as she is, even she can't stand up to the newcomers.

</li><li> When it comes to runes in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/33/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw">Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> muggles are far superior because while one can only carve runes so small by hand and still be accurate, a machine can carve them small enough to need a magnifying glass to see and still be completely accurate. Several projects involving runes had previously been considered impossible/impractical because no one could carve them small enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNatural20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNatural20">Harry Potter and the Natural 20</a></em>: Milo was flabbergasted to know people could make big chunking carriages of steel (i.e.: trains) move.

</li><li> Further, it comes down to a matter of scale. The semi-phenomenal, nearly-cosmic powers of magic simply cant contend with the power of a lot of Muggles working really damn hard all together all at once. Its like comparing a pressurized water mining tool to all the collective raindrops of a flood.

Years later, when the "normals" and the mutants met again, the normals had developed technology to such a point that every person had access to more capabilities than the mutants (like Syndrome wanted to do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:

This is true to the point that even genuine wizards are very rarely seen doing any sort of magic in the series, since it's often better to just deal with most problems in the mundane way. (To illustrate, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">entirely possible</a> to conjure up a loaf of bread instead of baking it, but not only would the time and energy you'd spend be equal to that if you'd just baked it, you'd also have to research the exact spell <em>and</em> end up attracting attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Things from the Dungeon Dimensions</a>.) Subverted in the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldHalfFull">rare</a>) situation where magic actually <em>is</em> the best choice.)
</li><li> Particularly noted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies">Lords and Ladies</a></em>, when the elves prove to be quite resistant to magic, but are perfectly vulnerable otherwise (<em>especially</em> to iron <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Morris dancing</span>).
</li><li> Witches tend to prefer mundane solutions (psychology, chiropracty, the placebo effect) over magical ones, though they may try to make you <em>think</em> they used magic, as a big part of being a witch is making sure people know you are one. Wizards are flashier, but at the very least Archchancellor Ridcully has a similar view. Like all wizards he carries a magical staff, but his first instinct when dealing with a threat would be to simply bludgeon it, his reasoning being that anything that can take a thwack from six feet of oak is probably immune to magic as well. And when faced with a choking man, the other wizards started debating which spell could save him, obviously not going to find a solution in time. Ridcully just gave him a smack on the back, and he started breathing again.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is the reason why the supernatural community in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries">Dora Wilk Series</a></em> hides from muggles, although more than our weaponry, leaders of Thorn worry about humanity's forensic medicine and modern research technology. The whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> could be blown up by a blood test performed on some unlucky werewolf or magical. As one of the characters put it, "It's not the Middle-Ages when we could drink the blood of a whole village with no one the wiser. It's the twenty-first century and humans have forensic medicine, criminology and dozens of other methods that endanger us all". Not to mention that the main character of the story prefers guns over magic (it's faster).
<ul><li> That has a lot to do with the magic world being founded entirely by exiles fleeing witch hunts on Earth. Most of the more competent and rational mages either died gating the "civilians" there and establishing the magic-trapping field surrounding the world which enabled them to survive without tools, or stayed behind to help guide the magicless societies towards an eventual reconciliation. The latter category included every engineer ("Death Mage") available. Initial emotional trauma led to institutionalized guilt over not releasing magic again into the greater universe once it was safe to do so (as promised), and thus to forgetting about and demonizing the nonmagical. And to being totally unprepared for encounters with it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> Killing a wizard is a very dangerous proposition since, if they know they're going to die, they can expend their life energy to create a "death curse" that can do really horrible stuff to their killer (ranging from killing them horribly to maiming them horribly, depending on how powerful their target is). So Kincaid explains that, if he ever wanted to kill a wizard, he'd do it from a mile away with a sniper rifle; the bullet would hit before they wizard knew what happens, and even if they do manage to work out what's going on and cast a death curse in time they wouldn't even know who their assissin was or where they were located. Harry acknowledges that it would almost certainly work too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes">Changes</a></em>, someone makes good on the idea. It is revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostStory">Ghost Story</a></em> that Kincaid carried this out at Harry's request to help him avoid becoming the Winter Knight. It absolutely worked too, although the intervention of Uriel, Mab, and Demonreach prevent it from sticking.</span>
</li><li> One of the primary limiters on Wizards specifically is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane">they frequently interfere with the functionality of technology.</a> This is something of a moving target—magic used to have other effects like making milk curdle or cause moles and warts—but the fact that supernatural creatures like vampires can use things like electronic bank accounts and stock-trading algorithms while the modern wizards cannot has been the major reason it's never really become a curb-stomp favoring the wizards. Marcone eventually takes this in an interesting direction by becoming an intermediary between muggle resources and various supernatural entities.
<ul><li> Marcone himself proves this trope applies in the short story "Even Hand", using a combination of firepower, booby traps, and prepared lines of defense to erode a Fomor lord's defenses until a single rune-marked bullet could take his opponent down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Fomor wasn't impeded by the sprinkler system, but that's because the defenses were designed to kill <em>Harry</em>, not a Fomor.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is also the reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraStrengthMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraStrengthMasquerade">Extra-Strength Masquerade</a>: bringing in mortal forces is the equivalent of a nuke in the supernatural community (and not just because they <em>have</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nukes</a>). Modern human weapons are still dangerous to most supernatural beings, and most types of supernatural creatures exist in relatively low number, especially compared to the billions of humans in the world. When the secrets of how to fight Black Court vampires got out via Bram Stoker's Dracula, they were driven to the edge of extinction in a matter of years. Despite this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">a setting</a> where throwing a werewolf through two buildings with magical brute force is impressive, but nowhere near the top of the power curve, everyone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angels</a> to Fae still use machine guns.
<ul><li> Speaking specifically of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the Fae,</a> ancient beings connected to nature itself: The top tier of Fae are literally immortal, and even weaker Fae have powerful magic they can use as easily as breathing. But because some bullets have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">iron</a> in them, steel-jacketed muggle bullets are dangerous to even the toughest fae. Even Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness, and on par with angels in terms of power, jumps back and refuses to touch a <em>nail</em> when it rolls towards her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only Mother Winter herself has the power to touch iron. And she turns it to rust.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TurnCoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TurnCoat">Turn Coat</a></em>, Morgan talks about a battle he had with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">skinwalker.</a> He couldn't take the monster down with magic, so he went for the next best thing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He lured the skinwalker onto a nuclear testing site right before they detonated the bomb, and hopped into the Nevernever right before detonation.</span> Even Harry has to admit that it was pretty damn awesome.
</li><li> It is something of a recurring theme in the series that muggle abilities can be just as deadly as magic, in their own way. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallFavor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallFavor">Small Favor</a></em>, he is ambushed and nearly killed by two of Torelli's goons, and admits that if things had played out just a little differently, the two hitmen would have killed him, Murphy, and Molly, with no magic required. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteNight">White Night</a></em> Harry mentions that most tougher supernatural beings can easily deal with, for example, a random human with a handgun. On the other a group of trained humans with high powered weaponry like automatic rifles, shotguns, and high explosives who know what they're up against can more than balance the odds.
<ul><li> It's mentioned that magical creatures need to pay attention to keep their constructs intact, and having their constructs get torn up is in part breaking their concentration. Enough and it forces them back into the Nevernever because they need to keep concentrating to stay in our world. Then... ectoplasm. Ew.
</li></ul></li><li> Harry uses this to his advantage, too. There's been more than one supernaturally-inclined baddy that thought he was totally out of the fight once he'd exhausted his magic, or they'd disarmed him of his staff, only to receive a few slugs from a .44 while they're gloating. In one sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SummerKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SummerKnight">Summer Knight</a></em>, Harry and Murphy take out a heavily magic-resistant ogre using the contents of a Wal-Mart: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">steel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">chainsaw</a> to lame it, and a Super Soaker loaded with gasoline and a can of Sterno to light it on fire. And then Harry runs down a plant monster with his car, and Murphy finishes it off with the chainsaw.
</li><li> This is one of the reasons that the Red Court does so well against the White Council in the war. Most magical creatures don't interfere with technology nearly as much as wizards, so they (and even more so, their goons) can threaten wizards much more successfully. Early on in the war, the White Council is desperate to secure the Ways in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie">Land of Faerie</a> because the Red Court's ability to use modern transportation will let them easily outmaneuver the Wizards otherwise. Additionally, money and law are mentioned as facets of power, and any self-respecting magical faction has a lot of money they can throw around.
</li><li> In the Dresdenverse, a few Muggles even do <em>magic</em> better. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostStory">Ghost Story</a></em> completely non-magical coroner Waldo Butters has, by virtue of being curious, analytical, having a good memory for even half-heard facts and having a good teacher, become one of the world's most proficient magical theorists in less than six months, outstripping wizards who have been using magic for centuries.
<ul><li> It also goes the other way: the most impressively powerful wizard spell so far involved the mundane humans doing all of the actual work <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of putting the satellite the Blackstaff used for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> up there in the first place,</span> and the most complex wizard spell involves using the muggles' modern plethora of construction materials and surveying methods to build a hyper-accurate simulacrum of a city for use in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMagic">Sympathetic Magic</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A major plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a>,</em> where not only do <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Coo-Hatch almost hand the Hetwan a victory over Olympus with a fairly-primitive cannon,</span> but Senna's ultimate plan turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">importing an army of gun nuts into Everworld to help her overthrow the gods, who, it turns out, aren't <em>quite</em> as immortal as they thought.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The aforementioned white supremacist gun nuts are feared by the protagonists as one of the most dangerous forces in Everworld (a setting filled with gods, magic, aliens, and mystical creatures), even after the death of Senna, their witch leader. And rightfully so, considering just one Sennite armed with an Uzi slew a dragon with ease. The Sennites go on to kill a mythical giant and slaughter the better part of a company of elite Celtic warriors known as the Fianna. For their final trick, they manage to slay Fenrir in seconds in addition to driving off Loki and his grand army of trolls.</span>
</li><li> Not all of the examples of this trope in Everworld are combat-related, per se. The protagonists half-joke that their modern running shoes are one of their primary advantages whenever the shit hits the fan. April saves Sir Galahad's life with relatively basic modern first aid and medical skills (painkillers, stitches, and an improvised blood transfusion), even after Merlin himself had written his wounds off as too serious to treat and was preparing to kill the knight out of mercy. Jalil offers to radically increase the productivity of the Dwarf kingdom's mining operation through modern principles of technology and engineering. The introduction of the telegraph is a massive game-changer in Everworld. There are numerous occasions where even if the protagonists can't solve the current problem through sheer power, the simple virtue of their background in the "real world" sometimes gives them the necessary knowledge to tip things in their favor.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicVersusTechnologyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicVersusTechnologyWar">The Magic Versus Technology War</a>, magic has both some incredible applications and solutions to problems, but is also shockingly lacking and limited compared to what the technology of the time could offer (the series being set in the 90's).
<ul><li> Magical communication seems to be significantly lacking behind the muggle alternatives pretty significantly. The best method they have is sending letters by owl, a system with a number of obvious flaws. Even something as basic as at telephone apparently has no magical peer. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire,</a></em> Harry mentioned that Muggle surveillance equipment might be useful. Hermione refutes it, but on the grounds that the amount of magic present around Hogwarts prevents anything electrical being used, not that it wouldn't be effective. There are several instances where such technology would have made life a lot easier or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot">solved a plot point altogether.</a> If they had any sort of magical-equivalent Google search for the library, half the suspense of Books 1 (Nicholas Flamel), 2 (The Chamber of Secrets), 3 (Sirius Black's bio), and 4 (gillyweed) would definitely be eliminated, as instead the kids were forced to just stumble through on incomplete information. Books 5, 6, and 7 also feature significant issues with communications. Message boards, wikis, or any sort of standardized instant-communication system like cell phones or even two-way radios could have prevented <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sirius' death.</span> Although Harry did have a magic two-way mirror, the wizard equivalent of a cell phone (although apparently not common at all, as this the only time it appears in the series), he just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberedICouldFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberedICouldFly">forgot that he had it</a> (a fact which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> at the very end of the book).
</li><li> Regarding weapons, there are extremely long debates, some on this very wiki, about how far this goes. It's generally argued<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note341b4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note341b4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note341b4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">at least by the fans. Rowling is uncharacteristically silent on the debate</a></span> that a Muggle with a shotgun would usually beat a wizard, but since that's a rather vague scenario you get questions like "What happens if the wizard is smart enough to turn invisible or teleport behind his back?" or "Can a shield charm protect from a shotgun blast?". Of course this doesn't even get into more complex situations, like higher powered firearms, multiple attackers, or rifles with considerably longer range. (Mr. Dursley's rifle <em>was</em> rather worthless against Hagrid, but Hagrid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">didn't actually use any magic in that encounter</a> and Dursley never actually fired his rifle.)
</li><li> Wizarding medicine generally seems to be far superior to the Muggle alternatives. Muggle surgery was useless in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em> when dealing with magical injuries. When Mr. Weasley is in St. Mungo's for a magical snakebite whose wounds won't close, he and a young trainee healer decide to try closing them up using stitches. It doesn't work, the implied reason being that the snake's venom dissolved through them.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ywy7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ywy7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ywy7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which can be taken a couple of different ways - either the magic in the venom dissolves any Muggle solution, or the trainee healer used something organic, like "catgut" or cotton thread, which even ordinary venom can eat through.</span> Even mundane injures that Muggles have to heal from over a period of weeks or months, such as broken bones, can be patched up in a matter of minutes or hours by Wizards.
</li><li> <em>Pottermore</em> suggests that the one area where Muggles have wizards beat is transportation. Only the most vehement anti-Muggle wizards will attempt to deny that the automobile and train are excellent modes of transport that really have no magical peer, which is why Hogwarts students travel to the school by train, why the Ministry owns a fleet of cars and why the Knight Bus exists. (Although since all three seem to be powered by magic and not a combustion engine it's debatable how "Muggle" it is when it's essentially a magic box in the general shape of a car or bus.) The wizards <em>do</em> have a number of varieties of instantaneous teleportation in the forms of Apparition, the Floo Network, and Portkeys, but they all have significant limitations. Apparation is a difficult skill to learn and potentially fatal if not done properly (and apparantly doesn't work in certain areas, like in and out of Hogwarts), the Floo Network requires a magical connection to other fireplaces and can easily go wrong, and Portkeys have a designated departure time and often leave users feeling ill, to the extent that when they were used for Hogwarts so many students either didn't turn up at all or were so ill they missed the first week of classes.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Weasley:</strong> Trains! Underground! Ingenious these Muggles!

He notes that when the Inquisition came knocking, not everyone who was arrested was a muggle, and not every captured wizard was able to effortlessly spirit themselves away. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> began for a very good reason — as a result, the muggles have never really had (or wanted) an answer for it.
</li><li> In Book 4, it's mentioned that entire sections of the Ministry of Magic are derailed by the Quidditch World Cup, with their logistical abilities struggling to accommodate 10,000+ wizards, when there are a dozen muggle stadiums that can hold ten times that number. Then again, this might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> since Muggles usually don't have to worry about keeping it a secret, and with the low population of wizards they're simply not used to dealing with crowds nearly that large.
</li><li> One thing that makes it weird is that the magical community (of Britain at least) seems to deliberately use obsolete technologies for aesthetic sometimes. For instance they've had paper and printing presses for centuries, but students are still writing on rolls of parchment with quills. They use candles as a light source, even though magical lights are a very simple spell. There are also random exceptions, like cameras working perfectly fine (though it could be an old-fashioned one). However, this may be a cultural difference exclusive to Wizarding Britain. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em>, the Americans use (era appropriate 1920s) technology more. The Wizarding government there use charmed typewriters to do official business.

This is a deliberate inclusion by the author, who didn't want magic to become an in-universe game breaker. It's neatly summed up in <em>By the Sword</em>, when a company of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a> is brought into Valdemar — a country where magic is all but unknown — specifically to help fight the mages of an enemy nation.

Long after human civilization has invented wooden floors and stones castles and drink from metal cups, Faeries sit on dirt floors in holes in the ground and drink from stone cups. And that was several centuries before the book takes place, by which point humans have invented printing presses, firearms, and steam engines.

They succeed rather effortlessly, but it was protagonist (high ranking Night Watch operative) orders to avoid confrontation and flee and not to use lethal force that would have overwhelmed charms. There is also the fact that the branch in question was very minor one with rather weak Other personnel being jumped on and outnumbered 20 to 1.
</li><li> It's revealed that the Communism experiment was deliberately sabotaged in Russia (turning it into the mess that it was). Why? Because it would have resulted in a world with advanced military tech, even more polarized than it was during the Cold War, and the collapse of the Masquerade and the extermination of all Others. Basically, no matter how strong they are, even a top-level Other can't stand up to billions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> with advanced tech.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> series, emperor Emhyr var Emreis, highly successful expansionist, quotes his preference for modern siege engines over the unreliability of magic. The only described large-scale attempt to use mages as a stand-in for artillery support in a major battle, while evidently successful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">led to high casualties</a> within the mages' ranks.
</li><li> In <em>The World of Eldaterra: The Dragon Conspiracy</em>, there are two problems. One, a fantasy race similar to orcs invading earth. Solved with Brits with bolt-action rifles. Second, dragons trying take over the world. Solved by one guy with a grenade.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a>.</em> In <em>Centaur Aisle,</em> Dor visits Centaur Isle which is near the fringe of magic, and therefore magic is used much less. As a result, they're much more technologically and socially advanced compared to the rest of Xanth which is stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>. This leads Dor to wonder (briefly) if that means it's better not to have magic. His conclusion: Ridiculous!
<div class="indent">He had followed the thought to its logical conclusion and found it absurd, therefore the thought was false.
</div><ul><li> Played straight in the first book, <em>A Spell For Chameleon</em>. Bink is exiled from Xanth and meets Trent, an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Evil</a>" Magician who has spent the last 20 years in Mundania (our world). Although he wants to get back to the land of magic, he and his army have come prepared, with superior ships that can sail against the wind, and catapults that can take down Xanth's shield (generated by a stone within it) once they know its location. Trent also mentions that firearms would end the conflict with ease, but he doesn't want them introduced to Xanth, and has trained his men in swordplay instead.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, after getting a taste of the comforts the modern town of Storybrooke has to offer (television, air-conditioning, indoor plumbing, etc.), the fairytale residents find themselves vastly preferring it to the medieval setting of the Enchanted Forest where they originally hail from. Also acts as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay">I Choose to Stay</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> periodically showed that even the most badass of supernatural beasties could be taken down with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real world</a> firepower. While it's shown that guns can't kill vampires, they do "hurt like hell," and most other monsters have no such immunity, and even Buffy was once almost killed by an ordinary guy with a handgun. Most fights were still superpowered slugfests, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">self-imposed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> kept the police or military from getting involved in the plot much, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> could only occasionally get their hands on post-medieval weaponry. This got a little wonky in Season 4 and beyond, though, when the government <em>did</em> get involved, equipping a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggle</a> soldiers with hi-tech weapons and sending them off to fight demons; how successful this actually was tended to vary by episode. One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s ideas for the season was "magic vs. science, magic kicks ass", which was proved by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in the penultimate episode, but up until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> made his move, it was largely back and forth.
<ul><li> In "Homecoming," when various people, vampires, and demons compete to see who can kill Buffy and Faith, it's the two humans with machine guns and grenade launchers who prove the most effective and deadly (that's not to say they <em>won</em>, but they lasted the longest at least). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To be fair, she had to trick them into shooting each other, she couldn't take them out directly.</span>
</li><li> In "Innocence," the Judge is poised to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">destroy the world.</a> The Judge is an ancient demon that it had previously taken an entire army to defeat because "no weapon forged can kill him". Buffy shoots him with a rocket launcher. To be fair, it didn't kill him. But he previously spent hundreds of years as a few large pieces and will spend a few hundred as hundreds of little pieces. (He didn't even know what the weapon was. His minions, however, certainly <em>did</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">ran the other way - fast</a>.)
</li><li> Mayor Wilkins, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Season 3, spent a hundred years making deals with demons in order to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaledUp">the gigantic snake demon Olvikan</a> and take over the town of Sunnydale, and possibly the world after that. Once he finally becomes a demon, he finds his vampire army being defeated by a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High School Students</a> armed with arrows, stakes, and a couple of flamethrowers, and he himself is taken down by some strategically placed dynamite.
</li><li> The setting is full of monsters and vampires that were previously defeated or placed in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">can</a> by ordinary non-magical humans with medieval or older technology and numbers on their side.
</li><li> In one season 1 episode, Darla found herself facing a pissed off Angel and a crossbow-wielding Buffy, and quickly neutralized Angel and nearly killed Buffy by whipping out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns">SIG-Sauer P226s</a> and shooting Angel first. The only reason our protagonist survived was that Angel managed to overcome the pain from getting shot twice (as a vampire, he wouldn't die from being shot, but it <em>really</em> hurt) and staked Darla.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> makes great use of this trope (as, to a lesser extent, do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">its spin-offs</a>). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Goa'uld</a> have starships, plasma cannons, and teleporters. The heroes have... normal, modern-day (or at least, late '90s/early 2000s) U.S. Air Force issue weapons. But the entire Goa'uld society essentially <em>runs</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a> — their high-tech staff weapons are scary and flashy, but inaccurate and have a slow fire rate; their Space Fighters are impressive, but a surface-to-air missile will bring them down as surely as a plasma blast would. This is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the show. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjlCVW_ouL8">In one episode<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, O'Neill points out explicitly that Earth's comparatively low-tech weapons can be superior to the Goa'ulds' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> because the Goa'uld are obsessed with intimidating and impressing their enemies, while primitive Earth weapons are designed simply to <em>kill</em>. As the show goes on Earth gradually gets more and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> of its own, but even then the protagonists remain armed with old-fashioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Tau'ri</a> guns.
<ul><li> The introduction of the Replicators is probably the best example of this. The Asgard are getting their super high-tech asses kicked by robots that assimilate technology—the more advanced the better. So how do you fight them? Bring in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">primitive ballistic weapons</a>. (In the Asgard's defense, they are savvy enough to realize this after the first time it's demonstrated.)
</li><li> Another factor is that the Asgard and Goa'uld always were preparing defenses against the Goa'uld staff weapons. The Asgards themselves noted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel">the idea of using expanding gas to send a projectile flying never occurred to anyone else</a>.
</li><li> To be fair to the Goa'uld, they do have a serious trump card in the form of their Ha'taks, spaceships that are impervious to nuclear weapons and capable of bombing a planet back to the Stone Age from orbit. It's not until relatively late in the series that the Earth has a defense against a direct attack like that. Much of the series is about preventing such an attack in the first place, usually using guerilla tactics and subterfuge.
</li><li> Even when Earth gets more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, they tend to use it to improve and enhance what they already have instead of simply replacing their existing technology. They don't use the super-science energy source to replace nuclear weapons, they use it to make nuclear weapons with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">really, really big bang</a>. It's not until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors">Asgard</a> hands them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">plasma cannon</a> strong enough to fight the ships of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Ori</a> that they upgrade.
</li><li> It's also revealed that Earth humans (Tau'ri) aren't the only ones who are good at this trope. After the destruction of the Goa'uld Empire, the resulting power vacuum is filled by various smaller powers, including a criminal syndicate (largely composed of humans) called the Lucian Alliance. For the most part, they're treated as a nuisance at best, using old Goa'uld tech that's already worse than what Earth has by that point. Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> comes, and we find out that the Alliance has its own tech geniuses who upgrade Goa'uld tech to stand up to Tau'ri tech, including the cool Asgard plasma beams that even the Ori couldn't handle. They freely use cloaking tech to infiltrate Earth and plant sabotage, as well as recruit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Za'tarc</a> agents.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em> has werewolf hunters, who can be extremely effective and deadly in their usage of modern weapons and technology. Stiles himself has even proven this from time to time, like when he pelted Peter Hale with concentrated acid. The fact that werewolves seemingly have a psychological block against using modern weapons themselves is never scrutinized too closely. Despite having been harassed by gun-toting hunters for much of his life, Derek himself never even considers using a gun until he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> at one point. Although Scott averts it somewhat when he uses some of the Argent's flash-bang arrowheads to blind Deucalion in the season three finale. Further, as a former hunter herself, Kate Argent still kept the habit of using firearms after she turned into a werewolf.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> (Seventh Doctor) episode "Battlefield", retired Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart kills the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Destroyer Of Worlds</a> by simply walking up and shooting it in the chest with silver bullets.
<ul><li> The reason The Brigadier had silver bullets was because when the Doctor had earlier warned him that the enemies he was facing were immune to bullets, the Brigadier pointed out that his troops were using armor-piercing bullets, and then explained how the UNIT armory was well stocked in a wide variety of bullets to deal with any of the aliens they'd faced. Then the Doctor asked about silver bullets, and right after he left The Brigadier immediately called up the armory to send over a case of silver bullets.
<ul><li> This gets a callback in the new series' <em>The Poison Sky</em>. The Sontarans are using a technical doohickey that affected the copper casings on UNIT ammo; the soldiers just switched to ammo with steel casings and tore them apart.
</li></ul></li><li> Look at it this way: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier">The Brigadier</a> was a British soldier who had personally faced down the most evil and terrifying things in the entire universe - the stuff of nightmares - and did not blink even once. That goes way beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> territory. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Destroyer Of Worlds</a> never had a chance. There's a reason why he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier">his own trope</a>.
</li><li> Defied in the special episode <em>Dreamland</em>, when the Doctor tries to warn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Colonel Stark</a> about the most likely betrayal of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Viperox</a> allies. Stark immediately points out how absurd it seems that "an army of giant cockroaches" could defeat tanks and planes, but the Doctor replies by revealing the Viperox once defeated an alien species whose technology was <em>1000 years ahead</em> of Earth's. When Stark later pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, his forces indeed prove ineffective against the Viperox.
</li><li> Becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> throughout "The Crimson Horror". The Doctor is prepared to do something clever, then one of the human companions solves the current problem.
<div class="indent"><strong>The Doctor:</strong> Hang on, hang on, I've got a sonic screwdriver! <br/><strong>Clara:</strong> Yeah? I've got a chair!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraviolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a></em> works on this, because modern technology means the "Code 5"'s - vampires - have to take a lot more care these days. The hunters are armed with the likes of gas grenades loaded with the active anti-vampire ingredient of garlic, and guns with video cameras (which, like mirrors, vampires don't appear in) and carbon rounds (like tiny, very fast stakes).
</li><li> Comes up repeatedly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians">The Librarians</a></em>. When Cassandra tells someone "There's nothing more powerful than magic." Jacob corrects her with "Except knowledge." When the villains steal Excalibur and the crown that controls it, the heroes realize it can't just be to use it as a weapon because even though a flying sword is more impressive than a regular one, the modern world has far more powerful weapons available.

While she <em>claims</em> it can't kill her, it apparently can, as a new host for the Witch's soul is chosen soon after.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> episode "The Sign of the Three", John and his fiancee Mary are trying to decide on table settings for their wedding reception while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Sherlock</a> sits in on the conversation. The former two leave the room for a few moments and return to discover that Sherlock has folded all of the cloth napkins into various origami figures. He at first attempts to explain how he did it with some mathematical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">Technobabble</a> before admitting that he learned it on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>, it was the humans who created synthetic blood that finally allowed vampires to "come out of the coffin" and live alongside humans. The Vampire Authority's primary goal is "mainstreaming", getting all vampires to integrate into human society and convincing humanity that vampires are not their enemy. The Guardian, the head of the Council, is convinced that it's too dangerous for the vampirekind to antagonize humans, as humans outnumber vampires at least 1000 to 1, and the vampires have certain weaknesses (e.g. daylight/UV, silver, Hepatitis D) that humans know about and can exploit. In fact, when a Pentagon general arrives at the Authority's bunker to warn them not to mess with the US Government, he points out that the government (and, probably, all other world governments) has been preparing for a fight ever since vampires went public. There are anti-vampire weapons and tactics that would, most likely, ensure a human victory.

All they have is ordinary men with their sharpened steel, their primitive firearms and their faith in the gods. And somehow, against all odds, they hold.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>, part of the angst for the Wizened is that, yes, they have magic and it does spiffy things; the problem is that it's just not sustainable.
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> supernatural characters have this problem, given that magic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad science</a> suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">No Ontological Inertia</a>, while human technology does not. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> and the equivalent dictates are in place partially because the supernaturals learned this.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>, this problem was deliberately caused and created by the Technocracy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> points out this trope in <em>Hammer and Klaive</em>, the sourcebook detailing fetishes (magic items). Fetishes used by the more rural tribes tend to be flashy, ostentatious and straight-forward. The urban tribes, on the other hand, tend to go "Okay, we can find a wooden stick, inscribe it with a few glyphs and anoint it with sacred oils, bargain with a spirit of lightning and thus get something to point at people to kill them — or we could go to the local gunshop to get the same thing for a couple bucks." As a result, the more modern werewolves engage in lateral thinking and use fetishes for purposes that <em>can't</em> be achieved technologically.
</li><li> In the <em>Gehenna</em> scenarios that involve the Masquerade being blown wide open, it's not uncommon for single squads of human soldiers armed with automatic weapons to take out thousands-year-old elder vampires whose cultural stagnation has kept them from adapting to the times. To wit; they're not so stupid or Luddite that they don't know what a gun <em>is,</em> it's just that guns didn't exist in a time when they were still young and didn't spend as much time as possible ignoring the world, so they have no idea how to practically handle such a threat in person. Escalation happens when the smarter vampires start taking action; for example, a Ventrue using Dominate to force the launch of nuclear missiles.
</li><li> In a twist, the Technocracy's mission is to expand the boundaries of human belief so that magical solutions don't appear immediately impossible to Sleepers and cause the magic to unravel. Rocket launchers and faster-than-sound aircraft are actually magical, but the muggles have been persuaded that they're mundane, and that's why they work (if you believe the Technocrats, which not everyone does).
</li><li> This carries over into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasqueradeFifthEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasqueradeFifthEdition">Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition</a></em>: What finally shattered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> was not some big supernatural event, but diligent signal-intelligence work by the NSA. As good as clan Nosferatu are at computer security, the muggle hackers were just a little better. This led to the re-formation of the Inquisition, backed up by most of the world's tier one special ops forces, which in turn led to the complete destruction of the Sabbat, the near-unravelling of clan Tremere and a severe weakening of the Camarilla in general. It turns out that while a single clueless muggle with a 9mm is an annoyance, a squad of SAS operators with military grade weaponry, explosives and incendiaries, air support and (above all) good intel on what they're up against and how to kill it, is a whole different bunny.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em>. It's very much not "Muggles do it better", it's "Muggles <em>screw up</em> magical solutions". Part of what incenses the Diamond Order about the Lie is the fact that it forces muggles to rely on purely technological solutions when magic could do so much more. A fairly untalented Mage could easily cure AIDS or cancer, feed an entire village single-handedly, fix all sorts of genetic drawbacks, or create rare materials... but for two slight problems. The first? Seeing Supernal magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromtheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromtheRevelation">drives muggles insane</a>. The second? Observation by a muggle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">destroys magic</a>. So, a well-meaning Mage can cast "Cure Cancer" on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient">Littlest Cancer Patient</a>... and all he does is drive them insane and give them maybe a few days more of life before their very soul unravels the spell and forces the cancers to come back. Tremendous power, but so very little opportunity to actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">affect the world</a> around them in any major, meaningful way: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">this is some of the true horrors of being a Mage</a>.
<ul><li> That said, some of the sourcebooks mention ways to get around this. One Legacy in <em>Legacies: The Sublime</em>, the Transhumanist Engineers, have a little game they play: they use magic to build an Imbued device (something that doesn't set off the Lie), which works just a tad better than what we have now, and show it off to Sleepers. And then mention they <em>really</em> hope nobody beats them to market. After that, they just sit back and wait for the viciously competitive tech sector to figure out how to do it. If the muggles can't do it better <em>now</em>, give them a little push.
</li><li> Subverting this is one of the main themes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece">Period Piece</a> sourcebook, <em>Mage</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Noir</a></em>, set in the immediate aftermath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Here, it's less 'Muggles do it <em>better</em>' and more 'Muggles do it quicker, more efficiently, more consistently and with less of a chance of breaking if people think about it too hard.' (Medicine and the then-recent breakthroughs in antibiotics are the main example) Muggles <em>can</em> do it better, but it's a much rarer occurrence. (The prime example here being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">the Atomic Bomb</a>.) There's even a whole Legacy, <em>The Quiescent</em>, whose whole philosophy is 'Muggles can and are doing it better, so what right do we have to get in their way?' So, they strive to become as unnoticeable as possible and keep their magic as unnoticeable and as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> as possible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> fan-game, subverts this trope. Sure the Inspired can make changes last forever (it's very hard though) and they've built some of the oldest still-functioning machines in the world and <em>anything</em> muggle technology can do a Wonder can do better. Despite all this as a rule of thumb: as soon as mundane science reaches the point where it can do something only Wonders could do before, the Inspired start using the mundane solution (e. g. switching from a network of Apokalypsi-based 'communication nodes' to... just connecting to the Internet). Sure, the effects aren't as flashy, but mundane science doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">fall apart</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">go berserk</a> when not "fed" enough Mania, it can be maintained by regular people without causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">Glamour Failure</a>, it can be mass-produced easily. In short, Geniuses do it better, Muggles do it reliably.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful">Princess: The Hopeful</a></em>, this is one of the core principles of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Court of Diamonds</a>. While Noble magic can accomplish wondrous things, it is a finite and limited resource. For this reason, the Lady of Clear Water teaches that whenever possible a Crystal should design systems by which the humans can solve their own problems, systems that will keep running long after the Noble has left for other work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>'s Autochthonia, this was made a basic point in the laws of physics of the world by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Autochthon, its creator</a>. While the Alchemical Exalted wield far more personal power than any muggle as the warrior champions of their people, Alchemicals lack Favored Abilities, which means muggles can become better at things much faster than them, and they are divinely forbidden from ever achieving a place in the gubernatorial hierarchy - not to mention only mortals can be blessed with the knowledge of how to make other Alchemicals by their patron god. This stands in stark contrast to most of the rest of the Exalted, which have an underlying theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglePower">being better than puny little humans in every way and designed to be rulers and lords</a>.
<ul><li> Though, Exalted lacks a clear division between magic and non-magic, anyway; unenlightened mortals are just so weak that they have no control over their Essence. On the other, other hand, the Solar Exalted, among the most powerful of Exalts, explicitly have powers that resemble the 'mortal' way of doing things (shooting arrows that hit you anywhere in the world and leaping over mountains instead of teleporting or firing blasts of fire) and are designed to win out against more obviously magical effects.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> adventure "The City Beyond the Gate" by Robert M. Schroeck, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> Magazine #100, where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PC</a> party goes through a dimensional gate to modern-day London, England. It's specifically stated that if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PC</a>'s decide to fight it out with the British police and/or military that they'll be slaughtered, either immediately or after their magic runs out.
<ul><li> On the other hand, some D&amp;D material averts this trope. For example, one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> novel states that the reason behind the Realms' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">Fantasy Gun Control</a> is because magical resistances are all-encompassing. It doesn't matter if you're throwing a stone, firing a bow &amp; arrow, or blazing away with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Vulcan mini-gun</a>, if there's no magical basis to it, then it won't even scratch someone under the effect of a Protection From Normal Missiles spell, though this only applied to older versions of the game and also ignores weapons like grenades, as explosive and fire attacks have always been a way to bypass such effects.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern">d20 Modern</a> Urban Arcana setting. Obscuring mist? We have smoke grenades. Water breathing? We have scuba gear. Fireballs? Rocket launchers deal more damage. But at the same time, some magical effects are impossible to replicate with current mundane tech (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectroMagneticPulse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectroMagneticPulse">Electro Magnetic Pulse</a> spell, spell that turns the traffic in your favor...) and others do the things that mortal tech does but better - that Water Breathing spell protects you against getting the bends and doesn't require you to keep a death-grip on a cumbersome breathing tank, for example. The situation is further complicated by magic being the ultimate in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWeapons">concealed carry</a> and being able to reinforce muggle tactics and muggle tactics being able to reinforce magic (a fireball is essentially an incendiary explosive, and can thus be used in similar tactical situations where incendiary grenades might be used, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance">Combat Clairvoyance</a> abilities would be an extremely useful addition to anyone who would engage in otherwise purely mundane gunfights).
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em> adventure involved a villainous plot to psychically link a dreaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> to the collective unconscious of humanity, thus driving the world's entire population insane in its sleep. As a campaign-preserving failsafe, one of the proposed alternate endings was that, if the player characters couldn't stop the plot, it would indeed establish such a connection ... only to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth">the abomination itself go insane</a> because, while its own otherworldly mind was powerful, the minds of humans were equally-strange to it, and there are <em>just so darned many</em> humans on Earth that its psyche would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">overwhelmed by sheer numbers</a>. Humanity, on the other hand, just has nightmares.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>'s Clan Invasion, the invading Clans had even more powerful versions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that the Inner Sphere spent 300 years trying to replicate, and had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">genetically enhanced soldiers</a> trained in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a> from the day they were born. However, outside of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a> powered armor warriors, the Clans' genetic enhancements were either nothing to write home about or were actually <em>worse</em> than their Inner Sphere counterparts in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePlane">Space Plane</a> pilots.

On a mechanical level, the Knight Arcs, Become Somebody and Allegory, are extremely good at miraculous combat, with Become Somebody giving an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Auctoritas</a> to support you and Allegory straightforwardly letting mundane actions take on miracles - but in both cases, the best way to shut them down is to simply apply a mundane action with a higher Intention level.

The airship itself is one of three that were originally made for the sole purpose of dragging a sorceress into space so she couldn't harm the world any further; she was made docile enough for this to work by what amounts to cryogenic suspension.

A character with low Faith can't use magic well and beneficial spells are less effective when cast on them, but by the same token, they also take less damage from magical attacks. Thus, wizards tend to get cut down pretty easily by faithless characters if not backed up with conventional weaponry.

</li></ul></li><li> At first glance, it might seem like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfLegends">Rise of Legends</a></em> plays magic and technology fairly equally, but then you realize that one of the factions uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">Magic from Technology</a> and, in the game's plot, curbstomps the current tech and magic users.
</li><li> A major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em> is that sufficient amounts of one cancel out the other. Guns jam in a wizard tower, but spells fail to work in towns with steam engines and industries. Part of why this is a big issue is because technology is much easier to use and lends well towards the kind of ubiquity you'd never see out of mages.
<ul><li> The best mechanic example of this is healing. Healing potions and spells require you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> - the more character is bent toward magic, the better the results. On the other hand, conventional medicine and pharmacology works for everyone - even mages - on the same, constant and efficient rate.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a> many "True Magics" have been lost due to the continued growth of technology. True Magics are defined as an act of magecraft that cannot be duplicated by mundane means. Before the twentieth century, flight could be considered a True Magic but ceased to be such once airplanes were invented. Even outside of True Magic, the inherent danger and limitations of magecraft mean that the mundane approach is often safer and easier.
<ul><li> For a direct example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> Kiritsugu largely bases his fighting around normal human weaponry. Mages are pretty much all completely scornful of technology and thus dismiss it completely. Kayneth is utterly shocked when Kiritsugu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pierces through his magic barrier with a high caliber bullet</span> and vows to use his full strength to block the next one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which is actually when Kiritsugu uses magic to win, but still.</span> Apart from this, magical familiars used for spying are pretty easy to detect and be fooled by illusions, but you can neither find nor trick a mundane camera with magic.
<ul><li> This trope is subverted when it comes to Servants, who can typically move so fast that normal humans can't see them. Mages believe that only a Servant can defeat a Servant, and by and large, that's true with almost anytime a human is forced to face a Servant, they lose. Badly. The only exceptions have been the result of very strong magic for a human, or the human managing to exploit a weakness of the Servant.
</li></ul></li><li> A subtler example would be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuzuki Souichirou</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>. After becoming a Master, he simply continues with his daily routine while his Servant does the job; coupled with his lack of Magic Circuits, this allows him to pass undetected by enemy Masters and Servants alike. When it comes to fighting, he takes advantage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">surprise factor</a> and tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">kill as swiftly as possible</a>. Finally, he's not above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldThem">retreating</a> when things go bad.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kuzuki</span> zigzags this trope since he's only strong enough to pose a threat to a Servant because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his own Servant Caster uses her magic to make him strong enough. Without her help, Kuzuki was killed by Archer almost immediately.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon1998">Spyro the Dragon (1998)</a></em>, the last and hardest of the standard enemies you fought were not the magicians, not magical beasts, but Gnorcs wielding grenades and machineguns.
</li><li> An amusing scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a>: Unlimited</em> plays out like this. You are told to equip an adventuring party for battle with a dragon, including a knight, ranger, wizard, and cleric. No matter what you equip them with, they will attack the dragon in sequence, only to pull out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">bazookas</a> and blast it the dragon to pieces.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena">Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</a> games, mage-type characters are often out-DPSed in lategame by "carries" with their normal attacks. But also subverted in that the high DPS is usually achieved with the aid of buffs from spells and magical items.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>, alongside its many superheroes and villains, has normals like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Chris Redfield</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Frank West</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Haggar</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SagaFrontier2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SagaFrontier2">Saga Frontier 2</a></em>, Spell Arts and enchanted weapons of wood and stone have traditionally dominated the battlefield. Along comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer">Un-Sorcerer</a> Gustave XIII, who decides to get around the limitations of his disadvantaged birth by training in the use of Weapon Arts and steel weapons, and later creates military units who are so equipped. The resulting steel soldiers cannot use magic, but as steel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">resists magic</a>, they are nearly immune to it in turn, and the mundane superiority of steel over stone leads to a horrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curbstomping</a> of anyone not so equipped.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros.

And then you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Snake</a>, one of the strongest fighters who uses military explosives for most of his attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em> (of all things) referenced this trope in their promotional release for the tier III British battleship the Bellerophone. It notes that the battleship would have slain the Chimera way faster than her namesake because the original Bellerophone was just a demigod in bronze armor riding a magic horse where the HMS Bellerophone has several inches of steel armor and twelve-inch guns.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, you can use your badass powers - such turning your fists into claws or wrecking balls, shapeshifting, and super-strength powerful enough to make people explode into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">Ludicrous Gibs</a> by <em>fist-bumping yourself</em> within ten feet of them - to slaughter the defenses of your objectives before tearing them down brick by brick. Or, you can just hijack a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">helicopter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">just shoot the objective until it dies</a> in total safety, and then fly around and destroy every Infected Hive and military base within, oh, half an hour. Helicopters are <em>so</em> overwhelmingly powerful and effective (especially given the Infected, despite their grossly superhuman strength, have no real anti-air power beyond throwing easily-dodged cars and boulders at you) that it's kind of inexplicable that the military has so much trouble getting anything done. Ditto artillery strikes- the Infected have literally no defense against them, so even boss-level enemies that can rip tanks apart with their bare hands can be taken out with one radio call.
<ul><li> It's telling that, outside of a small handful of missions, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2">[PROTOTYPE 2]</a></em> doesn't give you the ability to fly helicopters until the very end of the game. Stealing tanks and other military hardware is still often the most effective way of dealing with anything though.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">X-COM: UFO Defense</a></em>, humans are outgunned, outnumbered, and have nowhere to run. So they take what victories they can, take what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> they can scavenge from their enemies, and learn how to use it. By the end of the game, human tech is at least on par with alien tech, and in the case of the final vehicle you can develop in the game, the Avenger, it's leaps and bounds <em>better</em> than the largest alien battleship. Top that off with perfectly replicated alien technology, armor that's stronger and has much more utility than any alien gear, and an outright canonization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7mhvq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7mhvq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7mhvq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Anything a specialized alien can do well, a human can do well, without the drawbacks that the alien suffers</span>, and the alien invasion is quickly ground to a halt.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> takes it a step further, with the XCOM team not only adapting alien tech but improving on it in literally every way. The Firestorm interceptor is capable of shooting down a much larger and better-defended Battleship single-handed. Aliens use plasma rifles? XCOM develops plasma sniper rifles. Floaters use crude jets that give them vast mobility, but also require replacing significant parts of the base species with disturbing technology.

</li><li> Another episode, taking place on the island Avalon, featured a wizard who now had an extreme amount of magical power and the power to travel through time. The first thing he warned his younger self was that taking over the world would not be easy because human technology of the late 20th Century rivals the most powerful magic (the wizard in the question is from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a>). In fact, the reason he wants to make Avalon his launching point is that it cannot be reached by non-magical means.
</li><li> Curses are shown to be written with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">nigh-impossible</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseEscapeClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseEscapeClause">"escape" conditions</a>, even with magic; ("They shall sleep till the castle rises above the clouds" and "They shall be stone till the sky burns"). Turns out technology (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">and loads of cash</a>) can do many things that were thought impossible to the curse writers. (Move the castle on top of a skyscraper and set the sky on fire by dispersing flammable gas).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Amon explicitly says that modern technology now allows any non-bender to go toe-to-toe with a bender, thanks to the spiffy taser gloves his men have invented. In practice, though, a bender still has the advantage at range (they haven't moved up to guns).
<ul><li> Subverted due to most electricity in the city being produced by fire benders working in electrical plants.
</li><li> Another example is how the Bender police, Metal benders trained as elite cops, were wiped out in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> by non-benders piloting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Giant Mechs</a>.
</li><li> However, the non-benders have been able to win most of their battles against the benders by either closing the gap or exploiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">the weaknesses of elements</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Vaatu</a> shows up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and fuses with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Unalaq</a> to become the Dark Avatar. An entire army throwing bending and weapons at him does nothing</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em> continues the general theme of the movie, the heroes constantly using technology to fight supernatural threats - successfully - time and again. This is played with in the episode "The Collect Call of Cathulhu" (Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyopOnTheCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyopOnTheCover">the name is misspelled</a>, something that the DVD collection even commented on.) Normally, muggles <em>cannot</em> face Cthulhu itself without being driven insane. However, the Ghostbusters were somehow able to do so. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> suggested that this was because they faced horrifying monsters on a regular basis, and the beast really wasn't <em>that</em> much worse by comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one sketch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers">the Planeteers</a> become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a>, and decide that since the US government is the world's second-biggest polluter, they'll perform a coup, take over, and use the might of the US military to force the world into being more environmentally friendly. When Captain Planet refuses to go along with this, they use their powers to brutally murder him. We then cut to a news report about the Planeteers ruthlessly storming the US Capitol building... until all of them were shot in the back by a single overweight security guard.
</li><li> Another skit had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">Gargamel</a> finding the Smurf village, not with his great magic, but with Google Maps.
</li><li> And yet another has some nerds playing a pen-and-paper RPG. One posits an alternative means to killing a werewolf: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">using a gatling gun to reduce it to paste, cooking and then </a><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">snorting </a></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">the paste, then defecating whatever's left and letting the sewage treatment system have its turn.</a> The game master stubbornly insists that a silver bullet is still necessary.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>'s "Woodland Critter Christmas" special, the Woodland Critters have the powers of Hell at their hands, ready to bring back the Anti-Christ. How does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Santa</a> beat them? With a 12-gauge shotgun.
</li><li> Here's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a> that almost got the heroes killed. In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries">Aladdin: The Series</a></em>, Aladdin and Jasmine went on a secret covert mission to infiltrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Mozenrath's</a> castle but did <em>not</em> ask for Genie's help, or even tell him about it. Genie found out what they were doing, and wondered why they would do something so dangerous on their own. (Mozenrath is <em>definitely</em> not someone you mess with without some serious backup.) So he followed them anyway, and as it turned out, Aladdin and Jasmine had the right idea. The dark wizard had upgraded his security with an anti-magic focus specifically with Genie in mind, so the two realized that their best chance of success would be to not use magic - or magical beings - at all. Genie's presence quickly gave them away, and they barely escaped. The one good thing to come out it was, he learned he had to start trusting them more.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>. Individual Jedi are presented being more of a threat than a group of battle droids or clone troopers, but the whole problem of having so few Jedi, as shown in the prequel films, does mean that the clone troopers have enough of an advantage to win a full-scale war. However, even if a character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>, fighting a Jedi nearly always ends in them losing.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoveDeathAndRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoveDeathAndRobots">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a></em> short, "The Secret War", the Red Army in late 1942 puts up a brilliant effort against ravenous Siberian demons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While the platoon members all die in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> against a huge barrow of thousands of them in the end, they still take down enough that in the morning the valley is littered with dead demons, and then a fleet of bombers arrives and blows the place to kingdom come.</span>
</li><li> While Gems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> have either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">Magic from Technology</a> or outright magic that typically outstrips anything on Earth by a huge margin, there have been a few cases where a more mundane solution has worked where the Crystal Gems have failed. In one case, they were able to patch up a magical storm using simple duct tape.
