Now what?
</p><p>A Catch-22 Dilemma is a situation that a character cannot resolve or get out of because they have nowhere to start working on it. Each step they must take relies on completing the step before it but starting the first step requires already having completed the last one.
</p><p>It generally appears in one of two types: either each of the objectives they must complete to progress rely on some other objective already having been completed first, or at least two of the objectives they need to complete are mutually forbidden.
</p><p>Both types leave the character frustrated and with nowhere to start in solving the problem or escaping the situation.
</p><p>Often, the solution lies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">taking a third choice</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">Cutting the Knot</a>. In games, finding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">Dungeon Bypass</a> the designer or GM overlooked is also an option. When time travel is possible, you can sometimes pull this off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.

</p><p>In common usage, a Catch-22 Dilemma is also known as simply a "Catch-22", after the book of that name by Joseph Heller. We have a page for the book at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em>, which is why this trope page doesn't use that exact name. Other names for this kind of dilemma are a "Closed Logical Loop" or a "Circular Bind"; in engineering and programming, it's called "The Deadly Embrace"; another term in programming is a "Deadlock".

His subordinate then tells him about a national treasure, a kind of drug that can age up whoever consumes it, and it might solve the age problem. The problem is, as said subordinate points out, the treasure is tightly guarded by the royal palace and the only legal way to obtain it is... marrying the royalty (the princess, in this case).

</li><li> In the Thriller Bark arc, Gecko Moria steals Luffy's shadow, uses it to animate a giant zombie called Oars and sets it on the rest of the crew. One way to return the stolen shadows is to defeat Moria, and as the battle goes on it seems like that the only way to defeat Oars is to remove Luffy's shadow. At one point Moria appears in a special cockpit in Oars' chest, giving the crew this dilemma; They need to get to Moria to stop Oars, but in order to get to Moria, they need to beat Oars. Eventually, the crew gets around this by breaking Oars' spine so that that the zombie can't move, even with Luffy's shadow.

Then when Jason asks Andy, she says "I'm okay with it if your father is."

</li><li> The PHB reads two memos, one which says that all official company documents must be recycled to meet the corporate sustainability goals, and one says that all official company documents must not be recycled to meet the corporate security goals. He reads them off at every weekly meeting because he doesn't know how to get rid of them.

The nine racers who will be on next day's roster are decided by a race held after the arcade closes, and the entrance fee is a coin; those who don't place in the top 9 don't get on the roster, thus can't earn any coins that day, so if they use the <em>last</em> of their coins to enter the qualifying race and don't place, they can never again be on the roster and thus can't ever get any more coins. This is done to keep Vanellope, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">supposedly a glitch,</span> from racing, though why it hasn't yet caught any of the others is not explained. (Conceivably the coins can simply be shared between friends, but this is never stated.)

In this case, it's a blatantly obvious cover for simple racism on the part of the brass, and the problem is solved when the unit's major and his white boss who helped him set the unit up call the brass on their BS and basically browbeat them into letting the Red Tails provide the air support for an amphibious assault. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They not only down several Bf-109s in the air, they follow them back to base and have a fun time blasting it to pieces.</span>

He can't reclaim his kingdom without dealing with Smaug, but the only way he can see to defeat Smaug is to rally the armies of the other dwarf kingdoms, who will not answer his call unless he is king. Gandalf suggests that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>: hire a thief to steal back the crown jewels from Smaug's horde, at which point Thorin can be crowned king and call upon his brother kings for aid.

The impossible task mentioned from the previous movie was accomplished using the help of Santino D'Antonio who is associated with the High Table (an international conglomerate of mafias), help that was provided using a blood oath. The Continental Hotel has a rule that all blood oath markers must be respected once cashed in, meaning the owner of the blood oath can force the recipient to fulfill any one task they desire on punishment of death if they refuse to comply. Santino cashes in the blood oath he has on John Wick, wanting him to assassinate his sister who inherited their father's leadership position at the High Table rather than him. John Wick who by this point is sick and tired of being an assassin refuses the blood oath, only to have Santino burn his house down as retribution for refusing; only leaving him alive because he still needs him to fulfill the task. Winston despite liking John Wick a lot more than Santino doesn't have the power to override the blood oath system and tells John that he must obey it or else his life is forfeit. Not even killing Santino will fix the situation because then the Continental will be forced to hunt him down and execute him, nor can he refuse for the same reason. The only way out of the Catch 22 is to fulfill Santino's task, and then he will have free reign to get revenge on Santino for burning down his house. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07h4q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07h4q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07h4q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Many of the keepsakes of Helen, his wife, were destroyed in the fire that consumed his house so now the last attachments he had to her went up in smoke, John is understandably pissed</span>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">The term was coined</a> by the Joseph Heller novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em>. It crops up over and over again there, in several forms:
<ul><li> Yossarian can be exempted from flying more bombing missions if the doctor does a mental evaluation and declares that he's crazy. But for the doctor to make that declaration, Yossarian would have to request an evaluation. Requesting an evaluation because he doesn't want to fly more bombing missions proves that he's <em>not</em> crazy because not wanting to risk your life repeatedly isn't crazy at all.
</li><li> An Italian peasant woman deals with soldiers who claimed that the actual text of Catch-22 did not have to be revealed when carrying out orders related to it, meaning that "they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing." (In simple terms, "We don't have to provide a citation of the rule that allows us to do this because the rule that we're claiming allows us to do this says we don't have to provide a citation of it.")
</li><li> Captain Black issued an order that everyone had to sign a "loyalty oath", but did not allow Major Major to sign it, then began harassing him because he hadn't signed it and, when Major Major asked to be allowed to sign it, Captain Black continued to refuse to allow him to sign it on the grounds that he hadn't signed it when the order was first issued.
</li><li> Major Major uses it himself, giving his aide orders that no one is allowed to see him while he's in his office. But people must be allowed in sometimes, so he orders his aide to allow them to see him when he's not in his office. (When he sees someone coming who he doesn't want to deal with, but who outranks him, and therefore could countermand his order to his aide, he jumps out the window.)
</li><li> When Clevinger gets fed up with Yossarian ruining his bi-weekly educational sessions with pointless questions, he complains to Colonel Korn. Korn then makes it a rule that the only people who can ask questions during sessions are the people who never ask questions during sessions. The sessions are then discontinued altogether since it is both pointless and impossible to educate people who never questioned anything.
</li><li> A prostitute laments that no man would want to marry her, because she's not a virgin. But when a man expresses a willingness to marry her, she flatly turns him down — on the grounds that she's not a virgin.
</li><li> After Doctor Daneeka is mistakenly declared to have been killed on a flight that crashed, he tries to get it fixed, but nobody will let him speak to the people who have the authority to correct this because they can't schedule an appointment for a dead man.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Atharon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Atharon">Atharon</a></em>, for a mortal to get an audience with the Avatar of his/her class so they can submit their (prayer) request, they need to make an appointment with one. To make an appointment with the Avatar, mortal needs to see! the Avatar of at least their discipline (other Avatars wont do it because they do not care about classes not related to their disciplines), after which it takes at least two months (up to several years!) until the Avatars make their decision whether to grant it or not. Except, a chance of mortal seeing any Avatar out in the real world is slim to none because they rarely leave their audience chamber. To even get to the door of the audience chamber, a mortal has to pass a series of gruelling tests. You dont like the rules? Luckily, theres a shortcut: after mortals death, said mortal gets to see the Avatar of their class immediately, no tests needed! Unluckily for the mortals, they come to see Avatars to be judged and sent to heaven or hell and are unable to make any requests or bargain with the Avatars at that point (because theyre dead). One of the POV characters resolves it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAThirdOption">Taking A Third Option</a>.

To work outside the domes, you need a license from the EVA guild. To get a license, you need to pass their exams... and <em>pay for your own suit.</em> A new suit costs more than <em>any</em> middle-class Artemis colonist makes in a year... unless they work outside the domes. Jazz (the protagonist) nearly dies on the first page trying to do an end-run around their racket with a used suit, leaving her having spent thousands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillSpendCreditsInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillSpendCreditsInTheFuture">slugs</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>.

It also can't do anything until it receives orders from its new captain. However, due to sabotage in its onboard power plants, the computer is mostly out of action for 110 years after the mutiny, and when it finally comes back online fully, all of the bridge officers (who have communication implants) are dead, and all of the lifeboats used by loyal crewmembers, which have communications equipment, have been destroyed, meaning that no loyal officers can order the ship to pick them up, and the computer can't consider doing so. In the present day, the computer, which has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming">developed full self-awareness</a>, is noticeably embarrassed when explaining this to the protagonist, who actually drops the trope name.

The other barbers of the land didn't want him cutting <em>their</em> hair, however, so they asked the princess to amend the rule to say that he isn't allowed to cut the hair of someone who <em>does</em> cut their own hair, which landed him into the quandary of whether or not he's allowed to cut <em>his</em> own hair.

They know it is a Rithmatic line because Fitch's chalklings react to it as one, but they can't figure out what it does. The obvious solution would be to draw the new line themselves and see what happens, but since you have to intend to draw a Rithmatic line to draw it (which is why all straight lines don't turn into Lines of Warding and so on), they have to know what the new line does before they can draw it.

A good example of this: Troubleshooters (Player Characters) get sent on a mission and are issued weapons to test while they go about the mission. But they also have to bring the experimental weapons back in prime condition. So the sod who gets issued 3 experimental grenades faces the dilemma of either using the grenades like he was supposed to or bring them back in one piece like he was supposed to. Failure in following any of the orders usually results in death by termination.

He awoke to his powers while in the middle of nowhere with just a handful of other <em>human beings</em> around. The two only mages he can reach, both in the dream and the real world (one of the members of the crew, and the latter's older cousin who relocated to otherwise mage-free Sweden), are of Finnish tradition and hence have magic that works differently from Reynir's. There seems to be a correlation between how close other mages are and how easy it is to reach them via the dream world. The space between mage sanctuaries is dangerous to wander in, and the oldest of the Finnish mages has told Reynir that he's really not supposed to leave his safe area at all, especially considering his current strength. This puts Reynir in a position of not being able to reach other Icelandic mages safely before he gets better at magic but needing another Icelandic mage to make him better in a decent timeframe. Because of this, he's mostly relying on experimenting and praying his gods for a few pointers, with the latter possibly being an unreliable channel. In later chapters, he's working with variants of a rune he remembers seeing in his home farm once.

Peppermint Patty wants to prepare ballots, but the girls have to decide first on who passes out ballots.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lucy Van Pelt:</strong> Wait a minute! You can't vote unless we have ballots! <br/><strong>Marcie:</strong> If we can't vote to see who will pass the ballots, how can we have ballots to vote?
</div><ul><li> She avoids that dilemma by asking those in favor of letting her pass out ballots to say "yes". The proposal is approved with unanimity.

Things don't get any better when Daffy loses the last of the money in a craps game. Since the manager has Porky and Daffy confined to their room, they can't go out and get a job to earn the money, and the manager won't receive the money Porky and Daffy need to pay their bills, since they can't leave the hotel.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>, Steve wants to go on a hunting trip with Stan, but Stan won't let him come because he's still a boy. When Steve asks how he can become a man, Stan stays it's simple: he has to hunt and kill an animal. Steve then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> that he can't do that if Stan won't let him join the hunting trip. He even mentions the book <em>Catch-22</em>, but Stan says that he doesn't read any books he hasn't already read.
</li><li> In "Bee is for Bear" from the PBS animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CuriousGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CuriousGeorge">Curious George</a></em>, a beekeeper says that she can't remove a beehive from a tree unless the tree branches are trimmed down first. So they call in a tree-trimmer, who would be happy to remove the branches if something is first done about the bees. It all comes to moot when a baby bear arrives and knocks down the hive.
</li><li> Gilbert finds himself in one of these in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a></em>. Gilbert wants money in order to purchase a tripod, so he tries to get a job babysitting for the adults. However, the adults are uncomfortable leaving a child in the care of someone with no experience. Gilbert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> his predicament, lamenting that he has no experience, but how is supposed to <em>get</em> experience if no one is willing to take a chance on him? Fortunately, Anne provides a solution when she offers to babysit with Gilbert and oversee his attempts at childcare — since Anne is experienced, the adults are willing to let them both do the job, allowing Gilbert to get paid <em>and</em> get experience with a trainer.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One that's all too common is "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140811235043-203184238-how-to-overcome-the-permission-paradox-you-can-t-get-the-job-without-the-experience-but-you-can-t-get-the-experience-without-the-job">The Permission Paradox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", where businesses offer starting-level jobs, but require that the person hired already have a certain level of experience. You can't get a job without having experience, but you can't get the experience without having a job.
<ul><li> Thankfully can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> via certain certifications or training courses that outright say that they count as a certain amount of experience.
</li><li> Additionally, this is often a sign that the job is already meant for a particular candidate, but organizational rules or state regulations require that it is listed publicly for a time. Also alternatively, apply anyway; the posters may prefer to hire a candidate who has less than the required experience over having the job unfilled.
</li><li> It also leads to dilemmas, such as a job that requires 4 years' experience in a particular software package, and the job applicant applying actively <em>created</em> that particular package only 1.5 years ago.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain types of jobs and careers (especially ones that pay well and/or have good benefits) require a certain educational background and/or a college degree. Going to college costs money. You need a job to make money. Cue the endless circle. Some ways around this are financial aid (which is limited), taking out a loan through the college, or being fortunate enough to have someone willing to help pay for your tuition. Many countries even have free tuition at public universities. Of course, not all options are open for many people due to certain circumstances.
</li><li> Many employers prefer an uninterrupted work history in their job applicants. This creates a dilemma for unemployed applicants since they're viewed as less employable since they don't already have a job (after all, a skilled or motivated worker would already have a job) so they don't get the job, which creates a larger gap in their work history and causes their references and experience to age and decay, which means they have an even harder time getting a job, leading to the situation where they can't get a job because they don't have a job.
</li><li> One theoretical application of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcubierreDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcubierreDrive">Alcubierre Drive</a> that would not require large amounts of exotic matter would be to use masses placed along the intended travel path, creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceLanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceLanes">Hyperspace Lanes</a>. Unfortunately, these masses would themselves have to be moving faster than the speed of light, so you'd need an Alcubierre drive to make an Alcubierre drive.
</li><li> Politicians who are not "front runners" in elections can't get votes even from people who support them above all other candidates because voters don't want to "throw their vote away" on a candidate who "can't win," but losing votes in this way is exactly what makes them unable to win. One solution that's gained ground outside North America is to switch from a first-past-the-post system (highest vote-getter wins, whether or not it's 50%+1) to a runoff system (50%+1 votes wins; if no one gets it, a second round is held between the top two candidates), or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">in the Anglosphere and nowhere else</a> to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant-runoff voting (AKA "alternative vote" in the UK and "ranked-choice voting" in the US)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated if no candidate gets a majority, and the second choice votes on those ballots are added to the other candidates. Repeat until somebody gets at least 50%+1 votes.
<ul><li> Elections for a multi-member body (such as a legislature) allow for a third option in the form of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Proportional_representation">Proportional representation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which there are multiple winners assigned to each party proportionally to its vote share; naturally, this system requires large, multi-member districts, or even electing the whole legislature on a nationwide basis outright, to work effectively, and if there are any single-member districts at all <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5a2ir');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5a2ir" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5a2ir');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Party-list_proportional_representation">Party-list proportional representation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> doesn't bother with single-member districts at all; German-style <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">Mixed-member proportional representation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> uses the PR tier as a correction mechanism for single-member districts; and a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Parallel_">voting Parallel voting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> system like Japan's has the single-member and PR tiers elected separately.</span> they only form one tier of the legislature's membership.
</li></ul></li><li> Building a credit score in the US tends to have this problem:
<ul><li> Some banks require you to have a credit score to take out a loan or get a credit card. In order to get a credit score, you have to pay back money owed due to loans or credit. Of course, there are ways around this, such as through secured credit cards or piggybacking onto someone else's credit by convincing them to co-sign with you.
</li><li> Similar to the aforementioned "Permission Paradox", having a bad credit score can keep one from getting a job, but getting a job is the best way to improve a credit score.
</li></ul></li><li> The music composition software Finale PrintMusic, as well as the one for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> fan software Magic Set Editor, has a pretty big flaw with their user registration system on their forums. If your account should happen to get locked due to inactivity (and only about 3 months of inactivity will qualify), then it is essentially impossible to get back into it because you must contact a forum administrator to re-enable it, contact information is found in user profiles, and user profiles cannot be viewed unless you are logged into an account. You can't even make a new account (at least, without setting up an entirely new e-mail address) because the old information is still in the system and cannot be reused.
</li><li> To sign up for Sky services, including internet, you need an email address. To get an email address, you already need internet access. Fortunately, you can borrow someone else's or the like. In rare cases, your original order may run into a problem, in which case you need to sign up again. You can't use the email address you used before because it's already registered with Sky. One way around this is to use plus-addressing (e.g. if myname@example.com is blocked, use myname+sky@example.com) to create an address that looks different but isn't.
</li><li> UK telephone service provider Lycamobile has a similar problem. You are not told what the phone number of your new SIM card is; to find out, you have to dial *132#. This code only works if you have credit. To get the credit you have to top-up, to top-up online, you need to register the SIM... and to register it, you need to know the number. The way to break this deadlock is to make the first top-up using a voucher, but if you're housebound and have nobody to go and buy a voucher for you, you're screwed.
</li><li> Stack overflows in programming are often caused by a function needing information from some other function, which in turn needs information from the first function (more functions may be involved), creating an infinite sequence of calls back and forth filling up the stack.
</li><li> Similarly, deadlocks are a significant danger in multithreaded programming. Basically, thread 1 has a lock on resource A and is waiting for resource B to become available. Thread 2 has a lock on B and is waiting for A. So they each sit and wait for the other to finish, bringing your program to a grinding halt.
</li><li> In object-oriented programming, a class whose constructor takes an instance of the same class as an argument would not be able to be instantiated (unless it's nullable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12xbt');"><sup>What? </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12xbt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12xbt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">meaning a reference to a class instance can be set to null (i.e. nothing) instead of an actual instance</span>, in which case one could just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">pass null as the argument</a>).
</li><li> To get identification paperwork, you need to prove your identity. Which is the purpose of identification paperwork. Thankfully, multiple forms are issued, so you can, for example, use your birth certificate to get your passport. If you <em>lose</em> something along the way, though, good luck.
<ul><li> There was a case in Canada of a young man whose identification had actually been destroyed due to becoming a foster child. He ultimately used his criminal record to get a driver's license.
</li></ul></li><li> The curious case of the now-defunct Lakes Mall in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. The owners of the then-struggling mall in 1989 were faced with a unique problem: "The owners [of the mall] aren't paying off their mortgage, the mortgage holder charged in a foreclosure suit filed this month. We can't, says the owner, because the mortgage holder — which also leases space in the mall — isn't paying its rent." So the mall owner can't pay the mortgage owner because the mortgage owner can't pay the mall.
</li><li> Often the case with many high schoolers looking for a job to earn enough money to purchase an automobile. Many of these low-level jobs ask if you have a reliable way to get to and from your job. In other words, you need a car to get a job in which you're saving up to get a car. Some countries/cities try to go around this by offering cheap ways for students to use public transport...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">only for businesses to counter by outright requiring a driver's license</a> <em>and</em> a good driving record<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6w0xf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6w0xf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6w0xf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> while it's <em>possible</em> to get a driver's license without owning a car, getting a good driving record(typically 2+ years of driving experience)is pretty much impossible to pull off during high school</span>.
</li><li> During World War II, the International Labour Organization was faced with the potential of this. They were an agency of the League of Nations but were autonomous enough to keep running despite the League's issues. The problem they realized was that one thing they by their constitution couldn't do was change their constitution without getting approval from the League — so if the League ceased to exist in any sense capable of giving approval, then the constitution couldn't be changed and they'd be stuck as an agency of an organization that no longer existed. Ultimately they just decided that such a situation meant that article of the constitution <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">was no longer in effect</a>, allowing them to amend the constitution using their internal procedures and follow along when the rest of the League's remaining assets and institutions were transferred over to the United Nations.
</li><li> A classic one for computer users is booting up a computer without a keyboard attached to the system in some manner and get "Keyboard not detected, please press F1 to continue."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note75wj1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note75wj1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note75wj1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which actually means you should plug in a keyboard, then press F1 to make the computer detect it. This is no longer an issue, as USB is hot-swappable by design.</span>
</li><li> Setting up a new computer and/or reinstalling an operating system can be like this. You need to download and install the drivers for all of your hardware, which often includes the network adapters you need to connect to the Internet. Usually the solution is to have another computer on hand that you can use to download the drivers and then copy them onto a USB drive.
</li><li> Way back in the days of minicomputers and mainframes with <em>very</em> expensive memory, as much as $1 a bit (in the 1960s) or $1 a byte (in the 1970s) it was very important to make programs not use a lot of memory, or the computer didn't have a lot of memory. So someone got the idea of the "overlay," a feature where only part of the program was loaded into memory, and parts you weren't using weren't loaded until you needed them. For example, a word processor wouldn't need the printing function until you wanted to print something, so when you did want to print the editing part could be "swapped out" and the printing part is "swapped in" from the overlay. How this was done was a part of the program called the "overlay manager" that decides which part needs to be brought into memory and which part does not. This was a great idea until someone decided they could save even more memory and put the overlay manager in with the overlays...
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> version seen frequently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedurals</a> is created by laws restricting search and seizure, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. A careful criminal can entrap the police by leaving little enough evidence at a scene that the police cannot get sufficient probable cause to be granted a search warrant. They need evidence to get the warrant to get the evidence. The usual solution is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, often by flipping a witness.
</li><li> In the 2010 Supreme Court case of <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins</em>, defendant Van Chester Thompkins was considered a suspect in a fatal shooting in Southfield, Michigan. After being advised of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirandaRights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirandaRights">Miranda Rights</a>, Thompkins was interrogated by the police; he never stated at any time that he wanted to rely on his right to remain silent, nor did he want to talk to the police, nor did he say he wanted an attorney. According to the court records, Thompkins remained virtually silent throughout the interrogation, and the police decided to make an appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs, asking him if he believed in God, prayed to God, and asked him if he asked God to forgive him for shooting the victim. Thompkins answered yes to each of the questions, and when he realized what happened, he made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his right to remain silent, had not waived it, and that his self-incriminating statements were involuntary. The court dismissed the motion and sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole. Later, when his attempted appeals were rejected by the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Federal District Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th circuit reversed the decision. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that Thompkins' silence during the interrogation didn't constitute invoking silence, and he waived that right when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to the police.
<ul><li> In other words, merely being silent doesn't invoke the right to remain silent, since voluntarily and knowingly remaining silent constitutes a waiver of the right to remain silent, and a suspect has to invoke one's Fifth Amendment rights orally and unambiguously in order to properly remain silent.
</li></ul></li><li> This is often a problem that arises with new technology or media formats:
<ul><li> This is what doomed high-quality optical audio disc formats such as Super Audio CD and DVD-Audio. The publishers wouldn't release disks because not enough people had players... but the public wouldn't buy the players because there weren't enough discs for it.
</li><li> The gaming industry's relationship with the Linux operating system can be described this way. Not many people play on Linux because developer support is relatively limited, and developer support is limited because not many people play on Linux. Starting to be averted with services such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> getting ports to some distros (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Valve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Valve">Valve</a> even wrote their own gaming-optimized distro for their Steam Machine gaming PCs).
</li><li> This can also affect game consoles too. If a console launches with a poor lineup of games, its launch sales will be poor, which then makes publishers hesitant to release additional games. Usually, it takes a publisher taking a risk on an ambitious game that becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerApp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerApp">Killer App</a> for a console to catch on, or publishers grinding it out with popular games at the beginning of the generation while they wait for the console to catch on.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> Workshop has many addons that require multiple other addon, which requires the previous addon.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fl4f');"><sup>Example </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fl4f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fl4f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Addon A requires Addon B and Addon C, but Addon B requires Addon A and Addon C, and so on.</span> Since most addons don't need to be installed in a specific order, you can just install the other addons right after.
</li><li> Team-based multiplayer games can easily get to be this. You have to play and practice to "git gud" and be beneficial to teammates but to not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">The Millstone</a> and get trashed talked by people who think you should just quit, you have to be good to begin with. If you have friends that you can group up with it helps since they're likely to be more patient and help you out, but if not, <em>good luck.</em>
</li><li> An insurance company once had a rule against issuing car insurance to anyone who had not yet registered the vehicle in their name. That was in a state that required anyone trying to register a vehicle to provide proof of insurance in their name. The company eventually changed that rule.
</li><li> Applying for healthcare, insurance, and other similar necessities will have you pay your premiums based on your income and the type of services you get will also depend on your income. It's quite common seeing people who make too much money to qualify for getting health insurance for free and not make enough money to actually afford the medication and doctor visits.
</li><li> Looking up a word in a dictionary to find out how it's spelled. In order to find it, you have to know how to spell it. In most cases, you can get close enough, but with a word like 'pneumonia', you won't find it in the N's.
</li><li> Many chess problems have an obvious-looking solution that runs into this in some form. "In order to execute a mating attack, I have to push my opponent's king into a corner, but if I do, he'll be stalemated before I can reach mate." The real solution usually involves a completely different line of thought.
</li><li> For transgender people, access to medical aspects of transition, such as hormones and surgery, often requires some pre-set amount of time spent living as the identified gender. However, the acceptance of a trans person's gender by society at large may depend on their having medically transitioned. (Eg: you can't change your gender on your passport or other ID without surgery, but you can't use your ID if it doesn't match the gender you present as, so you have to continue presenting as your assigned-at-birth sex just to live your life, so you can't get surgery.)
</li><li> Our current rocket technology is limited by this principle. To go faster, you need more fuel, but that also makes your rocket heavier. Because it's heavier, you need more fuel to move it, which also makes it heavier. This even has a name, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html">"the tyranny of the rocket equation"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Debtor's prison of any man unable to pay alimony or child support. He can't make any money while he's locked up, but as his debt only grows he can't be released. Meanwhile, the ex and kids get nothing anyway, and the taxpayer has to foot the bill of keeping him fed and housed in jail.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/black-fathers-parenting-child-support-policy-flaws">A similar, real example<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: man couldn't keep up with child support even with a full-time job, so his driving license was suspended, so he lost his job.
</li><li> This problem was far more pronounced in earlier centuries, where debt of any kind could land one in prison and prisons not only prevented an income, but charged for room, board, and such pleasantries as not being tortured (I.E. the "easing of irons.") The prisoner's only hope was to beg, get help from friends, family, and accomplices, or otherwise cut deals.
</li></ul></li><li> Cigarette smokers face a particularly harsh one when they are faced with a smoking-related health scare. The fear of illness produces anxiety and depression, which in turn heighten nicotine cravings. The withdrawal on top of the worry can cause quite the miserable experience.
</li><li> Substance addictions invariably turn in to Catch-22 situations. The only thing that makes you feel better about your problems is taking the substance, but the substance is creating the very problems that you are using it to escape from.
</li><li> In the early days of organ transplantation, the idea of matching donors wasn't fully understood. This meant that potentially fatal organ rejection was a constant issue for patients. To get around this, they were often given drugs to keep their immune system from attacking the new organ. This often worked, but a weakened immune system left them vulnerable to other diseases, including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and even cancer.
</li></ul><ul><li> Some sports teams, like the Dallas Cowboys, are regularly featured in nationally televised games because they draw higher ratings than other teams. And why do they get higher ratings? You guessed it, because they're regularly featured in nationally televised games.
</li><li> Niantic, the developers behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ingress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ingress">Ingress</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO">Pokémon GO</a></em> has a website where people can vote on whether submitted points of interests by other players should be in the game or not. To prevent people from spamming and being lazy by rating everything 1 star or 5 stars, a cooldown kicks in that locks you out from reviewing submissions temporarily if the system catches you falling into a review pattern. Because the submissions you get are randomized, it's entirely possible to get several submissions in a row that would rightfully earn a low rating or a high rating. This creates a situation where you play by the rules and rate the submissions as they should be and risk being hit with the cooldown or you add variance to your reviews (giving something 3 stars for example) and risk your review rating tanking because you didn't agree with the majority of the reviewers.
</li><li> The NIMBY attitude. Nobody wants, say, a prison or a toxic waste dump built near where they live. Everybody knows that such facilities have to be built somewhere, they would just rather have them built somewhere else. And, of course, there's only so much "somewhere else" to go around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPrisons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPrisons">In the US</a>, when a convict is released from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison">Prison</a>, one of the conditions s/he needs to fulfill in order to not wind up back there is to have a steady job of some sort. Of course, many employers are reluctant to hire someone with a criminal record, so many people end up going back (either because they couldn't get a job within the timeframe allotted to them by their parole officer, or because they get desperate and turn to illegal ways of making money so they can pay their bills. (They may also, especially if they've been in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateProfitPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateProfitPrison">Private Profit Prison</a>, have <em>debt</em> they incurred while in prison.)
