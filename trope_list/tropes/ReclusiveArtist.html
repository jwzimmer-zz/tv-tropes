<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> is widely regarded as being one of the best actors of all time and has three Oscar wins to his name, yet rarely grants interviews or public appearances. Additionally, he is also highly selective of his acting roles, with only six acting roles from 2002 to 2017, making him even more scarce from the public eye. After his performance in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhantomThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhantomThread">Phantom Thread</a></em>, he retired from acting and now lives with his wife in New York and Ireland, although he is eager to talk to fans that approach him.
</li><li> For a long time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> would only agree to be interviewed in character, though he relented in the 2000s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>, while happy to hog the limelight disguised as one of his characters (Ali G, Borat, Brüno, etc.), is a lot more reserved about appearing or being interviewed as himself. Considering Cohen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandFaces">almost unrecognizable as any one of his characters</a>, as well as his liking for messing with people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">who aren't actual actors</a>, this may be a necessity for him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyCarson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyCarson">Johnny Carson</a>, after he retired from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em>. He indicated that he would come back with another project, but only made less than a half dozen TV appearances (and the last one was 11 years before his death) and only granted two major interviews. Even before his retirement, he would often fax joke answers in lieu of giving a real interview and, according to his friends, was incredibly shy and introverted in his private life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle">Dave Chappelle</a>, who abruptly left his TV show in 2006 and only did a few amateur standup routines afterward (and nothing else). The film <em>Dave Chappelle's Block Party</em> was made before he quit. Nearly a decade after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> went off the air, Chappelle returned to a more active stand-up schedule and has even granted a couple of interviews and made an extended cameo in Spike Lee's <em>Chiraq</em>. It's been rumored that he's developing a new TV show, but at this point, nothing's confirmed (although some new comedy specials were bought by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> in 2017 to much acclaim).
</li><li> Richard Dawson, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em> star-turned-game show panelist/host, became this after his second turn at hosting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em> ended in 1995. When the show was revived four years later, then-current host Louie Anderson wanted him to appear on the first episode and "pass the torch" to Anderson, but Dawson declined. Overall, he only made a handful of public appearances, TV spots, and interviews in the 17 years between his final <em>Feud</em> episode and his death on June 2, 2012.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro">Robert de Niro</a>:
<ul><li> He does a lot of movies and makes numerous public appearances (he presided over the jury of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival). But whenever anyone tries to interview him... (unless you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrahamNortonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrahamNortonShow">Graham Norton</a>, that is.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Extras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Extras">Extras</a></em> did a joke based on this... Andy's utterly incompetent manager somehow gets an interview scheduled with De Niro. Andy doesn't show up.

She is said to be highly reclusive and odd, even going so far as to in 2007 go to a hardware store complaining she needed materials to keep the "aliens" away. However, she did give an interview in 2010 saying that she wasn't reclusive, she just wanted time off after working for so long, and noting that she still gets script offers and a return to acting wasn't out of the question.
<ul><li> However, she resurfaced in 2016 on the Dr. Phil show, battling mental illness.

Numerous people have tried to find him (including the film's director for a DVD commentary track) but his whereabouts remained unknown until he resurfaced in 2013 for a Christmas screening of <em>SNDN Part 2</em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo#Secluded_retirement">After she retired<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from acting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GretaGarbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GretaGarbo">Greta Garbo</a>—although in her case she rarely made public appearances or granted interviews even when she was acting. "I want to be alone" indeed.
<ul><li> Garbo said the media had confused her personal inclinations with the character she played in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrandHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrandHotel">Grand Hotel</a></em>. In an interview around that time, she'd said "I want to be <em>left</em> alone", not quite the same thing. It was her character in the play who said "I want to be alone."
</li></ul></li><li> Dan Godwin, best known for his roles of Franklin Delano Donut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/TheStrangerhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/TheStrangerhood">The Strangerhood</a></em>'s Dr. Cornelius Chalmers Esquire the 3rd, finds the adoration for his roles rather awkward so he avoids con appearances and the like.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SetsukoHara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SetsukoHara">Setsuko Hara</a>, star of Japanese cinema for some 25 years, best known for her roles in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YasujiroOzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YasujiroOzu">Yasujiro Ozu</a>'s films <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LateSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LateSpring">Late Spring</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EarlySummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EarlySummer">Early Summer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TokyoStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TokyoStory">Tokyo Story</a></em>. She quit acting the year of Ozu's death, and lived the entirety of her life in seclusion thereafter, refusing all interviews and photographs; even her death was only publicly reported almost three months later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973">The Tomorrow People (1973)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dean Lawrence, who played Tyso, has only given two interviews and attended one convention since he left the show. He's never seen at informal gatherings and his life post-<em>TP</em> remains a mystery (although it has been rumored that he now designs and manufactures fetish clothing). There's barely any talk of him within the fandom and any times where he <em>is</em> mentioned are when the stories featuring the character of Tyso crop up. What makes this even stranger is that judging from a few sources he doesn't seem like the reclusive type.
</li><li> Stephen Salmon, who played Kenny, has given <em>no</em> interviews (not even on the <em>Beyond Tomorrow</em> documentary) and made <em>no</em> appearances since he left the show. The fandom often questions whether he's even still <em>alive</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Al Matthews, who was likely best known professionally for his work as Sergeant Apone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, seemed to drop off the map in the mid-'90s, and very little was heard from him since. To whit, for almost a decade, many fans believed that he had died in 2002 - in actuality, it was a false story spread by one of his friends. He finally resurfaced in 2011 to provide voice work for <em>Operation Flashpoint: Red River</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines">Aliens: Colonial Marines</a></em>. It took Gearbox Software a long time to find Matthews' whereabouts, and they finally discovered that he was living in a small town in Spain. While Matthews did maintain a website, it was seldom updated. He died in September 2018.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrentSpiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrentSpiner">Brent Spiner</a> deliberately made himself extremely scarce for the first few years of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> to build a mystique around his character Data.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewWaterhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewWaterhouse">Matthew Waterhouse</a> rarely gives interviews, and when he does it's done with great reluctance.

It is known that Pahich had a thick accent that required his lines to be dubbed, but nobody seems to know just where he was from or what happened to him after the movie was released. Even co-star Brian Narelle has no idea what's become of Pahich. In an interview, he later explained that they never actually met during production despite their characters interacting in several scenes (Narelle's lines were filmed separately, with a body double being used in shots where they both appeared).
</li><li> Michael O'Hare disappeared from public view after leaving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Babylon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Babylon5">Babylon 5</a></em> early in its run, which together with the show's crew being notoriously vague about why it happened fueled all kinds of rumors. After his death in 2012, it was finally revealed that he had suffered from schizophrenia. Although he sought treatment, the delusions and paranoia caused by the disease made it too difficult for him to work and he eventually spent his final ten years hardly ever leaving his house.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilioEstevez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilioEstevez">Emilio Estevez</a> is very private compared to the rest of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBratPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBratPack">The Brat Pack</a>, rarely makes public appearances, and is usually the only one absent from cast reunions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub">The Breakfast Club</a></em>. When asked about this, he said "I've never been a guy that went out there to get publicity on myself. I never saw the value in it."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder">Gene Wilder</a> granted very few interviews due to suffering from shyness and the fear that he would have to be "on" all the time. In fact, in one interview, he asked that there be no live audience for the show because he was suffering stage fright. Prior to his death, he stuck to a few appearances every once in a while and his writing. Later in his life, it was also done to hide his Alzheimer's diagnosis.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaFiorentino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaFiorentino">Linda Fiorentino</a>, who is most remembered for her role of Dr. Laurel Weaver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a></em> has largely stayed away from acting in most recent days and is currently focusing more on her career as a photographer, as seen in her official site <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lindafiorentino.com/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This stems in part from the fact that the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em> mentioned how hard it was for directors to work with her, which has caused Fiorentino to largely vanish from the big screen industry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a> tragically became this following the failure of her 1986 sitcom <em>Life With Lucy</em>. Ball was reportedly extremely devastated by the show's quick cancellation. She never again attempted a television or film production and her subsequent television appearances and interviews were infrequent. She died three years after <em>Life With Lucy</em> premiered and one month after appearing at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarylHannah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarylHannah">Daryl Hannah</a>, who is best known for her roles in films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash">Splash</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Roxanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Roxanne">Roxanne</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet">Wall Street</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em>, suffered from such paralyzing shyness and social anxiety (due in a large share to her being autistic) that it made it challenging for her to venture out on talk shows, premieres, or award shows like the Oscars as a means of promoting her work. In a 2010 interview, Hannah proclaimed that her difficulties with social interactions ultimately had a seriously detrimental effect on her career. Her relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> began soon after that. They engage in environmental activism together and make films like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>'s <em>Paradox</em>, which she directed. Young is a private but not shy or reclusive artist, so perhaps his example has helped to ease her anxiety.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanArthur">Jean Arthur</a> was considered a recluse and rarely did interviews. She was naturally shy and never found the appeal of Hollywood fame. Asked if she would like to have an interview, Arthur replied, "Quite frankly, I'd rather have my throat slit." She also suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerformanceAnxiety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerformanceAnxiety">immense stage fright</a>, making her seem aloof or cold; however, her screen presence said the opposite: warm, outgoing, and inviting. After filming George Stevens <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shane">Shane</a></em>, she retired from the silver screen and went on Broadway; however, her insecurity would often get the best of her. Her last days were spent in her home in Carmel, California. She died at the ripe age of 90.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt">Chris Pratt</a> was once active on social media; frequently posting hilarious clips, promo tours, or visits to children hospitals (particularly on Instagram). After announcing his split with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaFaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaFaris">Anna Faris</a>, Pratt has changed his profile picture on every social media account and was inactive for months on Instagram until finally posting to promote upcoming films: the highly anticipated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom">Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</a></em>, and in addition sharing a little of his day-to-day hobbies from his farm life.
</li><li> Although bold enough to do interviews and PR for his movies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> is fairly private on his family and works to keep his kids' business out of the spotlight.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHiddleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a> used to have a very good relationship with his fans, often taking pictures with them in-person and posting his Twitter account. However, he stopped interacting with his fans and left social media to protect his privacy after many transgressions including cyberstalking, tricking him into meeting with them by posing as someone he worked with, and harassing any woman that has been photographed with him. His Twitter is now updated perhaps once every other month (if that) with very generic things, and it's been a while since anybody's managed to get a picture with him.
</li><li> Downplayed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPine">Chris Pine</a>. He's one of the few young actors who doesn't use social media despite being fairly outgoing and congenial.
</li><li> Character actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a>, while known for playing various over-the-top characters, most famously Doc Brown from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> and Reverend Jim Ignatowski in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>, is noted by fellow actors for being very shy and private in real life, rarely doing interviews. Around the 2010s, however, he has made appearances at comic book conventions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickMoranis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickMoranis">Rick Moranis</a> went into semi-retirement in the '90s, following the diminishing qualities of roles he was being offered, and having to deal with the death of his wife and raising his kids alone. He still rarely gives interviews, and his biggest role of note in the past 2 decades was a voice role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrotherBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrotherBear">Brother Bear</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeraMiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeraMiles">Vera Miles</a>, best known as Lila Crane Loomis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PsychoII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PsychoII">Psycho II</a></em>, retired from acting in 1995, and has been living as a recluse since. She hasn't granted a single interview since that time or made any kind of public appearance. However, she has been known to occasionally answer fan mail and send autographs to fans that write to her, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel">Jessica Biel</a> met with her grandson before portraying her in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a></em>. Even before her retirement, she seldom gave interviews, and even there, she mentioned her shyness and desire for privacy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesHawtrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesHawtrey">Charles Hawtrey</a> is a sad case. After being sacked from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOn">Carry On</a></em> series, he retired to Deal, Kent where he became a complete recluse, getting drunk, soliciting sex from sailors, and sporadically acting. When he died, only nine people attended his funeral, none of whom were friends or family.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage">Peter Dinklage</a> is extremely protective of his personal life, keeping no official social media accounts and not revealing the names of his children.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyDalton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyDalton">Timothy Dalton</a> is known for being an extremely private person who shies away from interviews and was reportedly <em>relieved</em> upon learning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> was replacing him as James Bond (his time as Bond is clearly <em>not</em> an old shame, but the spotlight and attention he received was atypical for him). That said, he's still known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">for being very professional and well-liked among cast members and crew</a> and has maintained a close friendship with the Broccoli family.

</li><li> Al Columbia, an independent comic artist who did macabre work such as "Doghead", "The Biologic Show", and "Pim &amp; Francie," along with the album artwork for the Postal Service's sole album <em>Give Up</em>. He is criticized by fans of the medium for occasionally displaying talent and having repeated long periods of inactivity in between.

This is certainly due to the fact that his artworks, while hugely popular and sought after, are mostly installed without permission and considered by law to be acts of criminal vandalism, for which he could be publicly prosecuted. On the other end of the spectrum, Banksy is also hated by many other graffiti artists, supposedly for plagiarizing their techniques and messages.

<ul><li> Theodor Kittelsen, another artist, had moved into the vicinity of Munch around 1910. Kittelsen, suffering from severe depression, rarely went outside at this point of his life, and his wife had to take all the errands for him.

"It is good to know Kittelsen lives nearby", Munch stated. "But he must never come and visit me". Kittelsen, when told this, agreed and said almost the same thing.

</li><li> Stephen Gammell, best known for providing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">infamously macabre</a> illustrations for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ScaryStoriesToTellInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ScaryStoriesToTellInTheDark">Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</a></em>, has greatly shied away from interviews since the book series ended. His last known illustrator credit was in 2011 and has since then dropped off the radar, to the point where he had no direct involvement in 2019's <em>Scary Stories</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryStoriesToTellInTheDark2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryStoriesToTellInTheDark2019">film adaptation</a>, and it is unknown what he thought of it.

Little is known of her life. According to the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, "She never appeared in public, nor mingled in private society, but kept herself apart, like the sweet bird that sings its solitary notes, shrouded and unseen." Christina Rossetti had to abandon a biography of her life due to a lack of information.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger">J. D. Salinger</a> was famous for this.

Some fans even suspect that there is no real Swartzwelder, with the name covering a collaboration between two or more of the rest of the show's staff, and he notoriously refuses to give interviews or appear in <em>Simpsons</em> audio commentaries. He was apparently entrapped into a DVD commentary for the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E5TheCartridgeFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E5TheCartridgeFamily">The Cartridge Family</a>", but it's still unknown if this was the real Swartzwelder and he ended his appearance by denying this.

Early on, there were even questions as to whether the man actually existed, with some claiming that he was actually a pseudonym for a more famous writer. In interviews, he cites various health conditions, such as chronic anxiety and agoraphobia are contributing to his seclusion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> is a borderline case.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">Harper Lee</a>. Due to her age when she died and near-total lack of public appearances, rumors had constantly circulated that she was dead (which did happen on February 19, 2016). She lived just long enough to publish a <em>Mockingbird</em> sequel called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoSetAWatchman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoSetAWatchman">Go Set a Watchman</a></em> the year before her death. Prior to that, she did emerge from seclusion long enough to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</li><li> American novelist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> never gives interviews and makes no public appearances. His reclusiveness was parodied on <em>The Simpsons</em>, where he was depicted with a brown paper bag over his head and saying "Get your picture taken with a reclusive author." Believe it or not, he was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">voiced by Thomas Pynchon himself</a> (the only time his voice has been broadcast in the media, except from another <em>Simpsons</em> appearance and a trailer to his novel, <em>Inherent Vice</em>).
</li><li> Patrick Dennis, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntieMame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntieMame">Auntie Mame</a></em> and other popular novels, hid behind his pseudonym all his life and, in his twilight years, maintained his anonymity by butlering in California.
</li><li> Rowena Farre, author of <em>Seal Morning</em>. When her book's popularity grew, her publisher was forced to expend considerable effort to find her. It was discovered that her real name was Lois Parr. Subsequently she published under another name. There is some disagreement concerning her date of birth—she may have been 26 or 35 when her book was published.
</li><li> Thomas Harris, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em> and its sequels and prequels. He didn't grant any interviews from 1976 until 2019, when he talked to the New York Times to promote his novel <em>Cari Mora</em>. In that interview, he explained that his books sold well even though he didn't grant interviews, so he didn't grant interviews.
</li><li> John Twelve Hawks, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourthRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourthRealm">The Fourth Realm</a></em> trilogy, lives off the grid, has never appeared in public and his name is of course actually a pseudonym. Not even his editor knows who he is; he communicates with his publisher using the Internet and an untraceable satellite phone.
</li><li> S. E. Hinton wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutsiders">The Outsiders</a></em> while she was in high school; her agent suggested using her initials, assuming that reviewers would dismiss a novel written by a teenage girl. She kept the name for later books to help separate her work from her personal life. Although she makes cameos in movies based on her work, she's avoided public appearances outside of a few awards ceremonies. She was also interviewed in 2018 for PBS' <em>Great American Read</em>, when <em>The Outsiders</em> was one of the hundred novels chosen as the greatest ever written by a public poll.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoTolstoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoTolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> was notoriously impossible to interview and hated dealing with the public. He was especially wary of the new invention of the movie camera in the early 20th century. Reporters would hide out and try to ambush him. One such reporter, much like the others, hid out for 3 days waiting to ambush him on the way home with his family. Instead of succeeding, he accidentally broke his film camera which literally brought him to tears. Taking pity on the man, Tolstoy helped him take his camera to a blacksmith shop to repair it after which he agreed to being filmed. This started a relationship of the only man ever allowed to film Tolstoy. And that's not even getting into his later life when he renounced his title and possessions and started traveling the world (granted, he only did this shortly before his death).

Especially in the early decades of his career, there have been rumors that he didn't really exist and that his name was the pseudonym of this or that famous author. Very few photographs of him have surfaced.
</li><li> Patrick Süskind, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Perfume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Perfume">Perfume</a></em>, has not published a novel since 1991, and never grants interviews or allows photographs of himself to be taken.

With copious illustrations.
</li><li> Russian Postmodernist writer Viktor Pelevin is (in)famous for his incredibly private lifestyle. He makes public appearances once in a blue moon, always wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a> covering his face, and gives no interviews; the few known details of his life are contradictory and unreliable. While his novels are invariably bestsellers and critical hits, Pelevin as a man remains a mystery. When it comes to reclusiveness, he is the Russian answer to Thomas Pynchon.
</li><li> Elena Ferrante is one of Italy's most famous contemporary authors. She's also so reclusive that her name is a pseudonym, and she refuses to say anything outside of letters written to her editor and publisher as she believes that books have no need for their authors once complete and has a fierce desire to maintain her privacy. It was speculated that she is a pseudonym of Domenico Starnone based on samples of their writing, but he <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/books/elena-ferrante-author-of-naples-novels-stays-mysterious.html?_r=0">firmly denies it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to which the media then shifted the speculation to his wife, Anita Raja, a well-known translator. An Italian journalist published an article claiming that Raja is Ferrante based on finance records as well as her family tree records, but the public response to the article has been negative as her readers were completely fine with the anonymity and felt it lent greater merit to her work. The article was also <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/3/13147536/elena-ferrante-anita-raja-doxxing-controversy-explained">perceived<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by her publisher, some authors, journalists, and literary circles as a gross violation of journalistic ethics and Raja's privacy, whether or not she's the true author.

</li><li> Until April 2015, nothing was known about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KJParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KJParker">K. J. Parker</a>. Finally, it was revealed that K.J. Parker was the pseudonym of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt">Tom Holt</a>, for works in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">very different style</a> from his own-name work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells">Rosemary Wells</a>, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxAndRuby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxAndRuby">Max and Ruby</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimothyGoesToSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimothyGoesToSchool">Timothy Goes to School</a></em> fame, doesn't have that much info about her life being a writer and has a short biography about her life on her official website. She did do some interviews on some websites such as <em>The Japan Times</em> and was featured on the news at one point years ago, but it's still not that much. Definitely somewhat less of an example than others, though, because she is known to do public appearances and a video about her career and life called <em>A Visit with Rosemary Wells</em> is available from Scholastic. She is also known to advocate for children's literacy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VCAndrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VCAndrews">V. C. Andrews</a>, though not to the extent as other authors on this page. Allegedly, she was a very private person and even burned her first manuscript because it was unintentionally autobiographical. She was also reluctant to do interviews and other public events after People Magazine published an interview that she deeply disliked for being inaccurate and unflattering.
</li><li> Angus Oblong, the author of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> book <em>Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children</em>, which was the basis of the show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOblongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOblongs">The Oblongs</a></em>, seems to prefer some amount of anonymity (albeit with a bit of a twist), preferring to go under his pen name (although his real name has been revealed), appearing on special features of The Oblongs DVD with his face blacked out, and making public appearances wearing clown makeup.
</li><li> Anne Perry, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCharlotteAndThomasPittSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCharlotteAndThomasPittSeries">The Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Series</a></em>, allowed very little personal information to be made public for the first decade and a half of her writing career. Then we found out why: she's actually Juliet Hulme, who along with her friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother in one of New Zealand's most notorious murder cases, as was brought to light when the film adaptation of the story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenlyCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenlyCreatures">Heavenly Creatures</a></em> renewed interest in what had become of them.

He had written numerous rebuttals to Lee's claims of being "THE" creator of Spidey and had been an outspoken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a> disciple, very obscure comics promoting Rand and Objectivism being the main bulk of his work until his death. Strangely enough, he was in the phonebook, or at least the location of his studio was. And he'd been known to entertain guests who just happen to go to his studio for whatever reason. Since the average comic book reader under fifty-five had probably never even heard of him, he was apparently not too concerned about fans camping out waiting for him. Very middle-aged British journalist and fanboy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRoss">Jonathan Ross</a> actually came knocking on Ditko's door unsolicited. He brought Neil Gaiman with him for good measure. This adventure was chronicled in Ross' documentary <em>The Search For Steve Ditko</em>. Ditko still refused to be filmed, however, so we'll have to take Ross' word for it.

He's all but disappeared from the public eye since ending his strip in 1995, except for some very rare news articles, such as his review of a biography of Charles Schulz.
<ul><li> He is reclusive to the point where rumors abounded that he would supposedly paint pictures then burn them to prevent fans from obtaining and selling them. He was also extremely reclusive <em>before</em> <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>; skipping award shows and dinners in his name due to his disdain/paranoia over corporate establishments.
</li><li> In one instance, a journalist asked to interview him. He responded by running away and hiding out in a motel for several days. He refused to even answer the phone, or the answering machine message of the frustrated journalist saying, "Fine, forget the interview, now would you please just go back home to your wife?"
</li><li> In June 2014, he collaborated with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine">Pearls Before Swine</a></em> writer Stephen Pastis. Pastis had this to say about it:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Now if you had asked me the odds of Bill Watterson ever saying that line [he wanted to collaborate on a comic strip] to me, Id say it had about the same likelihood as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> telling me he had a new guitar riff. And yes, Im aware Hendrix is dead.
</div><ul><li> He was also interviewed in the documentary "Stripped," and drew the poster art for it. The filmmakers made a big deal in their advertisement about how this was the first time Watterson's voice was ever broadcast in any format. However, while his voice was prominently featured, no current picture was included.
</li></ul></li><li> Darby Conley of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GetFuzzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GetFuzzy">Get Fuzzy</a></em> probably rivals Bill Watterson above. While he did allow some interviews in the early years of his strip, nowadays his public appearances are very, very limited. His last known appearance was in 2010 when he appeared with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> creator Bill Amend.

There is no commentary on his strips, save the increasingly cryptic "Notes from the Resistance," which hasn't updated in nigh 3 years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em> creator Tom Siddell, for a long time, was largely a mystery. He talked about himself very little, worked during the weekdays as an animator for an unknown video game company, and he lived in Birmingham. There were very few images of him on the Internet, and while he attends conventions on occasion, he never revealed his real face outside those appearances, instead drawing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> with shadowed, crazed eyes and a wonky smile. However, since he's begun working full time on his comic, his convention appearances have increased and he's allowed himself to be filmed for an interview at least once. He has also tweeted photos of himself on a handful of occasions, although usually not identifying the person in the photo as him. He would later explicitly reveal his face in his <a class="urllink" href="http://www.patreon.com/gunnerkrigg">Patreon video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (where he looks like a normal person).

The only thing known about him is that he comes from Mexico and that he is male. Maybe.
</li><li> Virtually nothing can be discerned about whoever is behind the name Jaho-12, writer and artist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FifteenMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FifteenMinds">Fifteen Minds</a></em>. They've been active on Tumblr since 2013 under the name 1212m, mostly posting fanart of Pokemon before starting the comic, and have never revealed so much as a scrap of information about themself, not even a country of residence or origin or even a gender, much less a real name or image. In posts thanking their followers for their support and such, they always use <a class="urllink" href="http://jaho-12.tumblr.com/post/76394906841">their personal reimagining of a humanoid Space Core<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> as a stand-in... which similarly lacks features.

It's been rumored that this was because he was extremely paranoid. He was reclusive to the point that to this day there's still uncertainty about whether his tracts reflected the way he saw the world, or he was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a>. If they are to be taken seriously and express his world vision, then it's normal that he was paranoid. On the other hand, maybe this reclusiveness accounts for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">blatant ridiculous inaccuracies</a> in his tracts.

He may or may not have shown up to receive his Eisner Award. The jacket blurb on one of his books claims that man was an impostor. He does have an active Twitter account, however.

We know they like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> enough to keep producing content for this amount of time. And... that's about it. We haven't even confirmed that they're only <em>one</em> person.
</li><li> The creator of <em>Farlaine the Goblin</em> is an interesting case. He does go to conventions and readers can contact him, but nobody knows <em>what his name is</em> because he is listed as "Anonymous" in book listings. The very few times he refers to himself, he uses "J" and nothing more. The creator said it because he wants people to focus entirely on the comic.
<ul><li> After a while, though, J started using "Pug Grumble" as a pseudonym because he realized not having a name made it difficult for people to follow up on new books in the series, and also because more and more conventions started requiring some sort of name for use before being given a table space. His real name is still unknown, however.
</li></ul></li><li> Lebanese-Brazilian political cartoonist Carlos Latuff. One of the few things we know is that he was born in the neighborhood of São Cristóvão in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but not where he lives or much about his personal life. Then again, he's probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">protecting himself</a>, knowing that he's been held in many a controversial opinion as an anti-semite in denial.

At least part of it may have to do with their personal life - they were originally known as "the Wachowski brothers", but later came out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> women. They finally broke their silence in 2012, and Lana officially came out after years of rumors, in an interview right <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/3MrotEnTUt0">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, made to promote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloudAtlas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloudAtlas">Cloud Atlas</a></em>. She stated that she was specifically doing it to dispel rumors that she was ashamed of being transgender, having decided that if sacrificing her long-held privacy could help others suffering from the same issues she did before her transition, it would be worth it. Her sister Lilly came out in 2016.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCimino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCimino">Michael Cimino</a>, the late director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeerHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeerHunter">The Deer Hunter</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate">Heaven's Gate</a></em>. After the hostility from the public regarding the latter film, he ceased granting interviews with American journalists for a decade. He was also rarely photographed (giving rise to a rumored sex change operation when more recent photos did appear) and very little about his private life was known. He last directed a film in 1996 and moved to France to write novels. When he died in 2016, his friends didn't even know he was sick.

He also left the Hollywood scene to ensure his kids won't become like the jerk bullies from his movies.

He did, however, do several interviews for several magazines (including <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-stanley-kubrick-in-1987-20110307">Rolling Stone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and Playboy). According to his family, after the release of <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, Kubrick fully intended to do a few television interviews to promote his film and to dispel some of the rumors about his personal life, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">died before he got the chance</a>.

He doesn't do traditional DVD commentaries, has only directed three films in twelve years (it took about four for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheWildThingsAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheWildThingsAre">Where the Wild Things Are</a></em> to be released), and rarely grants interviews. Even when he does, he tends to treat them as a prank (see the video in which he terminates an interview by stepping out of the car to vomit).
</li><li> Shane Carruth, the director of movies such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer">Primer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpstreamColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpstreamColor">UpstreamColor</a></em>, is known for long periods of silence between his films. He does have a Twitter account and does tweet every now and then, yet most of it is more related to his work than his personal life. Carruth himself has stated that he'll be making one last film before retiring from the movie business, so time can only tell.
</li><li> Marian Dora, the anonymous director of controversial films such as <em>Cannibal</em> (2006) and <em>Melancholie der Engel/The Angel's Melancholy</em> (2009). Dora has done only a handful of public appearances and interviews, with his face and voice being distorted in video ones. His real name is kept secret because he has supposedly received death threats and could potentially be charged with criminal offenses relating to the content of his works. The only thing known about his life is that he is a vegetarian and a physician for a living.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerrenceMalick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerrenceMalick">Terrence Malick</a> is notoriously reclusive and highly protective of his private life, to the point that his film contracts state that his likeness may not be used for interviews, and he never does promotional interviews. He came to Cannes one year (although he wasn't part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTreeOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTreeOfLife">The Tree of Life</a></em> panel), and has allowed people to take pictures and film of him working on his latest projects. However, he's still highly private. In June 2012, a paparazzi taking a photo of Benicio Del Toro outside a Hollywood restaurant inadvertently caught Malick on camera - the photographer had no idea who he was, and it was only afterwards that people pointed out it was the reclusive director.
</li><li> Michael Herz, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LloydKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LloydKaufman">Lloyd Kaufman</a>'s partner-in-crime at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Troma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Troma">Troma</a> is very shy and doesn't do interviews or do any on-screen appearances on Troma DVD's (in comparison to Lloyd, who does many live and filmed appearances). He even hired one of the Troma regulars to play him when an appearance was needed. Kaufman did include a picture of him in his book about the founding of Troma.
</li><li> Fran Walsh, the wife and writing partner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a>. She appeared on the DVD commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> and at the 2003 Oscars, but they've agreed between them that she should stay out of public life as much as possible, to avoid incidents like being mobbed by fans while taking their kids to school.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulThomasAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulThomasAnderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> is a more downplayed example. While initially open to interviews and commentary, during the promotion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Magnolia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Magnolia">Magnolia</a></em> he started to close himself off from the press, giving fewer and fewer interviews. (Although he still does grant them.) As his films became more sporadic, with only four being made (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PunchDrunkLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PunchDrunkLove">Punch-Drunk Love</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThereWillBeBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThereWillBeBlood">There Will Be Blood</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMaster">The Master</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InherentVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InherentVice">Inherent Vice</a></em>) since <em>Magnolia</em>, this trope has come more into play with even fewer interviews, no commentaries and shrouding the production of his movies in so much secrecy that people don't even know the titles, let alone a plot synopsis until near the release date.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> is known for never attending award shows, excluding the one time he appeared at the Academy Awards in 2002 to introduce a montage of film clips shot in New York. (This was the first Oscars ceremony after 9/11.) It should be noted that the world of Hollywood does not interest Allen in any way since he never craved for public attention or applause, or was bothered by people's opinions on his films - as long as they made enough money to pay investors that support his filmmaking.
</li><li> Randy Moore, the man behind the 2013 guerrilla horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromTomorrow">Escape from Tomorrow</a></em>. After the film's release, he did a couple of interviews and such and then practically vanished off the face of the earth.

<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">Manga</a> artists in general are usually shy or introverted and very protective about their private lives (either by shyness or by personal decision), and a number of manga artists don't even reveal their genders, often working under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName">Pen Names</a> that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoustacheDePlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoustacheDePlume">gender-neutral</a>.

Also, there are artists that don't want to be seen.
<p>It goes without saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a> mangakas follow this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, even in very crowded events such as Comiket, Comitia or COMIC1.

This has led fans to speculate that Ohba is actually two or more people (a theory made somewhat less likely when Ohba's partnership with Takeshi Obata is taken into account).
</li><li> Even in the <em>Death Note</em> handbook he says very little in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">the plot's</a> interpretations and himself.

While it does mention, one of her older mangas from the late '90s called <em>Pukupuku Natural Circular Notice</em> won the Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 2002. When the <em>Happy Happy Clover</em> manga started getting popular around 2005 as well as getting an animated series in 2007 along with tons of merchandise in Japan. The author made a post on the Shogakukan official website about some information for the upcoming volume for the mangas at the time. A year after the manga was finished, she later went on to make a one-shot manga based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sanrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sanrio">Sanrio</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Jewelpet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Jewelpet">Jewelpet</a></em> franchise in 2009. As of 2015, not that much information is known about the creator and hasn't made a new manga since 2009. However, she recently created a <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/SayuriTatsuyama">Twitter account<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where she posts <a class="urllink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgYYnZPUkAAhKQ_.jpg">sketches<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIVGYDRVoAA9A_Q?format=jpg">and illustrations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of her characters and gives some updates about her manga career and life.

It's to the extent that in the most extensive and well-known interview he's given out, the one for the DVD release of <em>Berserk</em>, he requested that he not be filmed.

However, Koume's face is visible in a video by somebody who was at Japan Expo in Paris.

There are many photos and videos of him, he has given out several interviews over the years, taken part in museum exhibits, and even been on national television; compared to most mangaka he seems quite comfortable in the spotlight.
</li><li> Nio Nakatani, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>. The about-the-author and production-backstory bit at the end of each volume avoids giving any personal details (including their real name) and renders the author as a gender-ambiguous person with a bird's head.

All we know is the date and year she was born, and that she was born in Toyonaka in Osaka, and she's created other shōjo manga for <em>Ciao</em>... and that's basically it.
</li><li> Paru Itagaki, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em>, is a very private person and has never shown her face in public, always opting to wear <a class="urllink" href="https://ramenparados.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paru-itagaki.jpg">a chicken mask<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> whenever she appears at events. One thing that <em>is</em> known about her is that she's the daughter of Keisuke Itagaki, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler">Baki the Grappler</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">On the other hand</a>, she's also launched an autobiography manga (<em>Paruno Graffiti</em>), indicating that she is at least willing to talk about her life in manga format.

As a result, he spends most video interviews with a mask on or with the camera focused on the back of his head. In one case, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/vizmedia/status/1197308574696783872?s=21">he had Midoriya's head edited over his<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the video.

Very few pictures of him can be found on the internet.

<ul><li> After "leaving" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett">Syd Barrett</a> remained in touch with friends, including his former bandmates, up until around the mid-1970s (around six years after he left Pink Floyd) when he retreated into seclusion in a London hotel, eventually returning to Cambridge permanently in 1982. Barrett is arguably the ultimate example of this trope. He gave his last full interview in 1971, played his last recorded gig in 1972, was last in the studio in 1974, last spoke to his former bandmates in 1975, and last willingly (and briefly) talked to the press and posed for photographs in 1982. Between then and his death in 2006, he barely communicated with the rest of the world except for members of his family and spent most of his time painting and gardening. He was often photographed by paparazzi and journalists would sometimes knock on his door in an attempt to secure some kind of interview although they would never get much more than a few terse words. He never explained why he had left the music industry or refused to talk about his past as a pop star (although it's widely believed that talking about it was distressing for him, something he alludes to in the brief 1982 "interview") and, contrary to popular belief, he was never actually diagnosed with any specific mental illness, although it's generally accepted that he had some kind of mental health problem. Ironically, whilst it's widely believed that Barrett's silence was largely because he wanted to forget about his past as "Syd" as much as possible, his status as an enigma arguably increased interest in his rather than reduced it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill">Lauryn Hill</a>, critically acclaimed alternative rapper whose sole album <em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</em> remains among the greatest post-Tupac hip hop albums of all time. Her career-shattering mental breakdown pre-dated that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a>. Currently, she is the mother of six children by one of Bob Marley's sons but still remains out of the public eye. In fact, nobody even knows where she lives. She does perform occasionally in concerts, but is notorious for being late (an egregious example being a 2010 concert that started at 8:30 and she didn't show up until midnight) and performing poorly. She popped up again in the tabloids in mid-2013 after being sentenced to 3 months in prison for tax evasion - her excuse was that the IRS had not been respecting her family's privacy.
</li><li> Jakob Dylan from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWallflowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWallflowers">The Wallflowers</a> rarely gives interviews, mostly because he doesn't like being compared to his father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>. This is probably why their more recent albums, as well as Jakob's solo albums, have seen a decline in sales since the smash hit, <em>Bringing Down the Horse</em>.
<ul><li> He's also very protective of his family and doesn't want his fame to interfere with their safety.
</li></ul></li><li> Musician and photographer Cynthia Dall, who occasionally collaborated with her then-boyfriend Bill Callahan (Smog) on some songs and recorded two albums for Drag City, six years between each (the first of which, released in 1996, was initially completely untitled with no artist information). She died in April 2012, nearly ten years after the release of her final album.
</li><li> Assuming he's still alive, a big assumption to make, under the circumstances, guitarist and songwriter for the alternative rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers">Manic Street Preachers</a> Richey James Edwards would be the one of these: he went missing in 1995 and there haven't been any confirmed sightings of him since. 13 years after he vanished, he took this trope to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme">Logical Extreme</a>: he was declared "presumed deceased"—in other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegallyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegallyDead">Legally Dead</a>. The band has still been keeping his share of their royalties in a bank account since his disappearance.
</li><li> Jeff Mangum, singer/songwriter for the legendary indie rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeutralMilkHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeutralMilkHotel">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>, suffered a breakdown as a result of the stress of touring. He stayed out of the limelight until 2008, where sudden concerts were performed.
</li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> bands tend to be like this. They frequently refuse to give interviews and often refuse to have their pictures taken. Most use pseudonyms and a small few don't even use names at all. Some particularly well-known examples:
<ul><li> French avant-garde black metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathspellOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathspellOmega">Deathspell Omega</a> are highly secretive; few photos of the members exist and, more notably, no one (apart from, presumably, the band members themselves) even knows what the complete line-up of the band is (the identity of the drummer is not even an identity of public conjecture).
</li><li> Ukrainian black metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drudkh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drudkh">Drudkh</a> refuse to have a proper public image. Only guitarist Roman Saenko has ever shown his face, and the band has never conducted personal interviews or performed live, despite being one of the most respected names in modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a>. They also have not released lyrics for some of their early recordings (although this is not exactly uncommon in black metal).
</li></ul></li><li> Australian singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmilyJanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmilyJanes">Emily Janes</a> is apparently trying to start a pop career. However, she has no social media accounts, has only ever given one interview, and has only two songs uploaded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. The most information the public can get is through her official website, but there's not a whole not of information on there either.
</li><li> One of the most famous examples in pop music is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>'s Agnetha Fältskog going into a practical self-exile on a farm in Sweden from the late 1980s. She reportedly rarely speaks to anyone anymore, with the situation being worsened from her split with former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalker</a>, Gert van der Graff. She's even earned comparisons to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GretaGarbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GretaGarbo">Greta Garbo</a>. She has since released an English pop solo album internationally in 2013 called <em>A</em>, and has since occasionally turned up to promote it and/or address ABBA reunion rumors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>, once he was a mega-selling solo act. It became a well-crafted part of his mystique, and when he became more available in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, culminating in the Oprah Winfrey interview in early 1993, it made headlines. Unfortunately, when the accusations arose that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">a molester</a>, the reclusiveness backfired on him badly. Subsequent attempts to be more open with the public were largely failures. The 2003 documentary <em>Living with Michael Jackson</em> was intended to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">Win Back the Crowd</a> (Martin Bashir was then most famous for a 1995 interview with Princess Diana that curried public sympathy for her), but he freely admitted in it that he still had slumber parties with children who weren't his, not realizing how badly this would be taken by the filmmakers and most of the world. It affected his career's more, and would not regain any respect until he actually died in 2009 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">Dead Artists Are Better</a> came into effect.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> used to play this up in his early days as part of his "horror show" image, staying locked up in his trailer with his boa constrictor during gigs and festivals, only emerging to perform with his band. This was, of course, just an act, and one that he later dropped.
</li><li> Glitch-hop/dubstep producer Tristam is notorious for having extremely little information shared to the public. Images and videos of him are very rare (none of which are recent), prefers to keep his true name and identity secret, and shares only vague and occasional updates on social media.
</li><li> Rod Evans, the original frontman for seminal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a>, briefly fronted the supergroup Captain Beyond after leaving Deep Purple before retiring from the music business and going into medicine. In 1980, he was talking into reviving the Deep Purple name (Deep Purple had broken up in 1976) with a bunch of unknown musicians. When his former bandmates got wind of the venture, they immediately filed a lawsuit. Evans was not only forced to disband the "Bogus Deep Purple", he was barred from receiving any royalties from his work with the real Deep Purple. With his music career in shambles, Evans returned to his medical practice and has since eschwed any contact with the media or his former bandmates-he didn't even show up when Deep Purple was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.
</li><li> The experimental rock group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a>. In all photos and public appearances, they're in some kind of disguise, usually their trademark eyeball masks. They also refuse to be interviewed by the press, adding to their reclusive nature. However, it's very widely suspected that they are actually the same people as their "management team" the Cryptic Corporation, who do interact with the media. Cryptic Corporation co-founder Hardy Fox finally outed himself as a Resident in 2017, and it was universally noted in media reports of his death a year later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush">Kate Bush</a> is often considered an example, though to hear her tell it, somewhat unfairly. It's true that she didn't tour for over 30 years between 1979 and 2014, and mostly disappeared from the public eye for the 12 years between <em>The Red Shoes</em> and <em>Aerial</em>, but she has consistently said this was to give her children as normal an upbringing as possible, and not from any reclusive tendencies. Still, she has done relatively little promotional work even for her later releases.
</li><li> Very little is known about the members of the band Black Moth Super Rainbow; all the members go by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames">Stage Names</a> and they rarely discuss their past in what little interviews they've done.
</li><li> For a few years, John Frusciante of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> basically locked himself away in his apartment and spent most of his time doing drugs.
<ul><li> The same was true for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis">Miles Davis</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, Layne Staley of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains">Alice in Chains</a> cut himself off from friends, family, and bandmates for the last three years of his life. His body wasn't discovered until two weeks after his fatal overdose. <em>The Rocket</em>, a Seattle music magazine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">already had his obituary written</a> from a few years earlier. Even before his seclusion, guitarist Jerry Cantrell (one of Staley's best friends) stated that not hearing from Staley for months at a time was not out of the ordinary.
</li><li> While less extreme than the previous examples, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer">Jeff Hanneman</a> was always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>; while the rest of the band would always take time to hang out and party with fans, Jeff would usually depart to the bus to read, and interviews were rare. Outside of recording and playing shows, Hanneman seldom saw his bandmates and usually preferred to stay at home and spend time with his wife. While Kerry King was criticized for referring to Hanneman as a good friend despite having not seen him for several months prior to his death, the truth was that even his best friends rarely saw or spoke to him and going several months without any real contact with him was completely normal and expected.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> was once so accessible that he regularly communicated with his fanbase via his official website at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>. But then he slowly became this. He had not released a new album since 2003, His last tour — one cut short by a heart attack that required multiple bypass surgeries — was in 2004, and his last live performance was in 2006. A few film/TV roles and guest appearances on other artists' albums later, and that was all. He only seemed to surface for the odd premiere or charity fundraiser and didn't grant interviews. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, it was generally accepted by fans and the music press that he quietly retired to raise his family, preserve his health, indulge in his hobbies (he paints, sculpts, and is an avowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm">Book Worm</a>), and enjoy the fruits of his labors...which made January 8, 2013 something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> for <strong>everybody</strong> when the website was relaunched, a new album announced, and a video for its first single released. <em>The Next Day</em> was a huge hit, but he still would not grant interviews — longtime producer and friend Tony Visconti has said Bowie ruled out the possibility completely — and would not be going on tour to support any new releases. Any chances of this changing ended with his death three years later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaftPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaftPunk">Daft Punk</a> is a mild example. While their names are common knowledge (Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo), the only confirmed image of the duo's faces was for <a class="urllink" href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/de74eafef93c37201edc6736d4a38c38/tumblr_o9f8x0dcBr1v0jfsto1_1280.jpg">the front cover of an issue of the British dance music magazine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <em>Muzik</em> (which was back in 1997). Aside from that, they're almost always hidden behind their iconic robot masks.
</li><li> Along similar lines, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarpenterBrut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarpenterBrut">Carpenter Brut</a> is known to be a Frenchman named Franck Hueso who likes horror movies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">and that's about it.</a> Even his live shows hide his appearance as much as humanly possible.
</li><li> Irish musician and singer-songwriter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> is still not comfortable with interviews and fandom, even as he approaches his fiftieth year in the business. Viewed as a curmudgeonly old misanthrope who has not improved with age, he has variably engaged in a rolling-in-the-gutter fight with one manager, in the presence of a visibly embarrassed BBC radio team there to try and interview him; described his fans as a bunch of ignorant worthless dolts (this backstage, where he initially refused to go at all in front of a paying public who had bought the gig tickets in good faith) and given a succession of irritated interviewers stubbornly monosyllabic answers. In fact, one of the earliest interviews with a very young Morrison is preserved to this day by Ulster Television and is gleefully brought out for blooper reels. A very young interviewer called Gloria Hunniford (who later went on to a stellar career as a TV presenter and hostess of interview format shows) is seen to gush profusely at being in the presence of Belfast's answer to Mick Jagger, and to enthuse about the broodingly handsome writer and performer of groovy music (this was in 1964 when Morrison was a startlingly good-looking young man). But after that build-up, could Gloria get a word out of him other than "yes" or "no"? She cannot, but this does not stop her trying, so she does, for at least five excruciating minutes. The look of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> in her eyes is unmistakable and very obvious. Morrison has not improved with age.
<ul><li> In his earliest "interview", a journalist turned up at the studio where the then largely unknown Morrison was recording. He had an appointment, which had been timed to a break in the recording work. Having waited around for a time, watching him reading a newspaper, the journalist approached and asked if they could do the interview now. Morrison's reply: "Can't you see I'm busy?!"
</li><li> In light of his 70th birthday, he finally consented to an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/van/van-morrison-being-famous-is-not-great-for-the-creative-process-not-for-me-anyway-1.2332216">in-depth interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with <em>The Irish Times</em>, in which the interviewer remarks that Morrison was quite pleasant and forthcoming during the interview, albeit just very blunt.
</li><li> He recently appeared in a mini-documentary by Lenny Henry passionately discussing the blues, so it seems that he only consents to appearances and interviews only if he's interested in the topic.

He grants few (or no) interviews and has a far lower online profile than Manning (or nearly anyone else in the group).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>:
<ul><li> In spite of his larger-than-life stage presence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a> was somewhat more introverted when he wasn't performing. Combined with an aversion to interacting with the media (a result of experiences in Queen's very early career when they were regularly slated in the music press), he stayed out of the public eye when he could. When he contracted AIDS, this tendency increased, to the point where he only revealed that he was sick one day before bronchio-pneumonia brought on by the disease killed him.
</li><li> John Deacon was always notoriously shy but almost completely withdrew from public life in the years after Mercury's death and gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMay">Brian May</a> and Roger Taylor permission to continue performing and releasing material as Queen without him. He does, however, continue to look after the band's finances and May and Taylor regularly consult with him.
</li></ul></li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a> artists, to the point where occasionally a producer revealing his/her gender (such as OSTER project being female) can spark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">Samus Is a Girl</a>-type reactions.
</li><li> Sly Stone, like the Layne Staley example above, stopped his music career to pretty much spend his time doing drugs. He stopped granting interviews in 1987, and only makes sporadic concert appearances (where he has sometimes left the stage after only performing for 15 minutes). Rumors abound that he's living out of his car now.
</li><li> Axl Rose, after the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> breakup, made no public appearances for seven years and granted virtually no interviews during the making of <em>Chinese Democracy</em> (which took at least nine years to record and release).
</li><li> While she has made a few semi-live singing appearances, and gives the occasional interview, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Enya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Enya">Enya</a> prefers to stay out of the spotlight and very rarely appears in public. Part of this can possibly be attributed to the fact that she's had stalkers in the past, some of whom have broken into her home.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> rarely granted interviews, mostly because of his reported <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> tendencies.
</li><li> British singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sade">Sade</a> (from the eponymous band of "No Ordinary Love" fame) has rarely been seen in the public eye since the release of <em>Love Deluxe</em> in 1992. She amassed a sizeable fortune but lived in total seclusion until the release of <em>Soldier of Love</em> in 2010. To note, a <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1245959/Reclusive-singer-Sade-returns-album-release-decade.html">Daily Mail<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> article noted that her promotion of that album was the first set of interviews she had done in more than a decade and that it had been eight years since she made a public appearance. She also spent most of the 2000s holed up in a mansion taking care of her son Izaak Theo (a transgender man, he came out as such in 2016) and avoided any and all contact with other people.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>
<ul><li> This fitted lead guitarist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a>'s image as the "Quiet Beatle", as many cited he rarely gave interviews during Beatlemania and was described as being introverted. He only did two solo tours after the band broke up, played his last full concert in 1992, and his final interview occurred four years before his death (and this was one of only a few he ever did in his later years). However, he was the only ex-Beatle to ever publish an autobiography and did participate in the Beatles Anthology TV series.
</li><li> Although more active than George, this was true on some part for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> during the later years of his life. However, it was mainly due to the birth of his son Sean, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">as he did not want to repeat the same mistakes as he did with Julian</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The founding members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> are notorious for this, staying holed up in their studio in Dusseldorf for days on end. Various anecdotes of their reclusiveness have been circulating for years, such as the fact that they will only answer phone calls when the precise hour, minute, and second is arranged beforehand - at which time they will answer immediately.
<ul><li> In one famous instance, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay">Coldplay</a> released the song "Talk", which used the riff of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ComputerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ComputerWorld">Computer Love</a>", Chris Martin had to send a letter through the lawyers of Kraftwerk's respective parties to seek permission to use the riff. Several weeks later, he received a letter back from the band - which consisted of a sheet of paper that just said "yes".
</li></ul></li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeifGarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeifGarrett">Leif Garrett</a> is a bit of a paradox —in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> he's very approachable, yet in the public eye, he's been known to be very reclusive and protective of his private life. He got a little better with this once he started appearing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest">World's Dumbest...</a></em> in 2008, and now he's in talks to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow">Reality Show</a> of his own.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buckethead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buckethead">Buckethead</a> is a definite example. The only known pictures (there are two confirmed ones) of him out of character is over 20 years old, and he's been giving less and less "interviews" (if you can believe it) over the past 5 or so years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jandek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jandek">Jandek</a>. No one even knows for sure what his real name is. He didn't even begin performing live until well over <em>twenty-five years</em> after he started his musical career. His name might be Sterling R. Smith, if he's the one signing the checks for Coorwood Industries, which releases nothing but his music.
</li><li> Songwriter Dennis Linde, best known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s "Burning Love" and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks">Dixie Chicks</a>' "Goodbye Earl", was a known recluse. He never attended awards shows, even when he won, and rarely gave interviews.
</li><li> Very little is known about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>'s personal lives, both on the road together (they broke up in 2010) and separately. Kix has kept himself in the spotlight as the host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown">American Country Countdown</a></em>, while Ronnie still releases music independently, but very little is known about them outside their musical ventures.
</li><li> Perhaps the ultimate example of this is Canadian musician Nash the Slash, former member of the progressive rock band FM (he also has a vast and eclectic oeuvre as a solo artist); since the late '70s, he has never appeared in public without a thick layer of bandages covering every bit of skin that isn't absolutely necessary for him to perform, and he has done his best to keep his true identity a mystery, at which he mostly succeeded until his real name showed up on Wikipedia relatively recently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector">Phil Spector</a> not only didn't talk to the press, but kept his ex-wife prisoner in his mansion to prevent her from being photographed (or seen in a bikini by others). Now that he's serving a jail sentence for murder, it's unlikely he's going to become more accessible any time soon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MFDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MFDoom">MF Doom</a> has not been seen without his mask since the '90s. We know his name is Daniel Dumile from his years as Zev-Love X, but that's about all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ScottWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ScottWalker">Scott Walker</a> only resurfaced for interviews when he had an album to promote, and virtually disappeared in the time between them. He even worked as an interior decorator in the downtime; he was that low-key.
</li><li> Ronald Jones, former guitarist of The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips">Flaming Lips</a>, left the band due to his increasing agoraphobia and his distaste of Steven Drozd's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">heroin usage</a>. Aside from working at a few local gigs, he practically fell off the face of the earth after leaving.
</li><li> Satirist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> gave up his music career after producing only three (or so) albums worth of material and retired to a life in academia. Not as extreme as some cases, as he's apparently willing enough to be interviewed, if only to cheerfully confirm that he's still alive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShaniaTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShaniaTwain">Shania Twain</a> became this after her <em>Up!</em> album in 2002. It turned out this was because she lost her voice due to stress in her personal life. After undergoing therapy, she regained it and reemerged with with a hugely successful Las Vegas residency.
</li><li> The girls that make up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop">J-Pop</a> duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClariS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClariS">ClariS</a> (best known for performing themes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Nisemonogatari</a></em>, among others) have done this voluntarily to keep them focused on their schoolwork. In an extreme example of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">they haven't even told anyone else outside their families about their career</a>, either.
</li><li> The Swedish metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ghost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ghost">Ghost</a> wears robes, hoods and masks on stage and refers to its members as "Nameless Ghouls" (to the point of them signing merchandise simply as "A Nameless Ghoul"). They refuse to comment on any speculation about their real identities, and even faked a singer switch to try to throw off speculation about the singer's identity. This later became moot when old members revealed themselves to be a part of Ghost (Martin Persneri personally confirmed himself one of the Nameless Ghouls) and a lawsuit came out that ousted a majority of past members who then also ousted the identity of Papa Emeritus as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Repugnant vocalist Tobias Forge</span>.
<ul><li> Also, one member <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fuse.tv/videos/2013/08/lollapalooza-2013-ghost-bc-interview">revealed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Dave</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Grohl</a> has performed with the band as a Nameless Ghoul.
</li></ul></li><li> Per "Dead" Ohlin, vocalist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a>, was known to be extremely reclusive and antisocial, to the point where even his own bandmates knew almost nothing about him until after his suicide.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BridgitMendler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BridgitMendler">Bridgit Mendler</a> is this. Her social media accounts appear to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">managed by her Public Relations team</a> and little is <em>really</em> known about her personal life, even who she's dating (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">not that she has confirmed or denied it</a>). Her VEVO channel on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> is about the only "true" social media she has.
</li><li> Asaki of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BEMANI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BEMANI">BEMANI</a> fame is particularly reclusive, concealing his full name, having few photos of him in circulation, and never showing up to BEMANI-related events. For the Private BEMANI Academy event, all participating musicians made an appearance in the promotional video and related media...except for Asaki and his collaboration partner 96; instead of their actual faces, two stand-ins, both of which obviously look nothing like them (Asaki's stand-in, in particular, is a <em>Caucasian</em> person) pose as them instead.
</li><li> Almost nothing is known about the life of blues musician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a>. He released only a pithy few records in his time, none of which gained any major recognition until decades after he died in 1938. What's more, although the people that he knew remembered him fondly, he was also quite reserved and shy (legend has it that he recorded his songs while facing a wall), so we have absolutely no words that came from his mouth, and only two positively-confirmed photographs (a possible third was discovered in 2005 and confirmed by one expert in 2013, but whether or not it's truly him in the photo remains hotly contested). We don't even know where he was buried- there are <em>three</em> different markers in completely different locations that bear his name, all of which weren't put up until the '90s!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Zigzagged a bit</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>. While he often appears in the public eye, mainly to promote reissues/repackagings of his back catalog, appear in Q&amp;A seminars about his music, or perform live (with or without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a>), and he has performed in many high-profile charity shows, most notably the Hurricane Sandy benefits, he has a considerably lower profile than he had for 20 years, and has rarely released material, especially in the pop vein since 1993's <em>River Of Dreams</em> album. Most of the new music he <em>has</em> released has been instrumental contemporary classical piano music.
</li><li> Swedish indie-synthpop/dreampop artist Sally Shapiro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">has not revealed her real name</a>, nor performed live or toured other than a short DJ tour in 2008, and rarely gives interviews.
</li><li> Mexican singer Luis Miguel is infamous for being very aloof, continuously refusing to talk about anything related to his off-stage life and keeping to himself in almost everything.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a> has never been very comfortable with the spotlight and nowadays prefers to stay home in Detroit unless he feels the need to appear in public. When his song "Lose Yourself" was nominated and won an Academy Award, he was at home dead asleep.
</li><li> In terms of her social media involvement, anyway, this is true of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a> as of 2013-14. She very rarely makes posts on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>. When she does so, it's usually to announce her involvement in one or another charity or creative or business venture. At least compared with her activity online in 2008-2009, she's only on occasion contacted fans directly or answered questions, or posted a photo or video on Instagram. Perhaps her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">admitted discomfort</a> with social media in general, and maybe the often violently abusive hatedom she has received, especially after her relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> went public, seems to have factored in this behavior (though she did privately spend time in a rehabilitation facility for undisclosed reasons for a week in 2014, as well).
<ul><li> It was later revealed that much of her inactivity had to do with her diagnosis of lupus, which affected her health physically and psychologically and led to her cutting her <em>Revival</em> tour short. A friend of hers, model Francia Raisa, donated a kidney to her as she lay bedridden for a long period in 2016, unknown to the general public until she revealed her struggles on Instagram. She is still generally uncomfortable with social media, but does have periods of activity from time to time.
</li></ul></li><li> The electronic musician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Burial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Burial">Burial</a> (real name William Bevan), who preferred to remain anonymous at the time of his debut in 2006. There was quite a bit of speculation about his identity until in 2008, he posted a blog entry on his Myspace revealing his face and name, stating that he's just a normal guy who just liked to make music. Since then, he's worked with artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Thom Yorke</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MassiveAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MassiveAttack">Massive Attack</a>, and still stays away from the spotlight.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pantera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pantera">Pantera</a> vocalist Phil Anselmo. He lives in a very isolated area (literally, a swamp in Louisiana) and refuses to have a Facebook page or even a telephone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKnife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKnife">The Knife</a> were notoriously shy in the early stages of their career, preferring to use masks to hide their faces in photos and rarely granted interviews. They've maintained that they were willing to talk to the press, just not the ones that want to delve into their personal lives, which limited the amount they did. When Karin started promoting her own music as Fever Ray, she was much amiable to interviews, albeit still refusing personal information and appearing covered in heavy makeup, largely to maintain her privacy.
<ul><li> Averted with the release of her album "Plunge" during which she used 'comparatively' little make up/masks to hide herself. And even talked about her family in interviews.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino">Childish Gambino</a> increasingly became reclusive from about 2014-2016, especially after his departure from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>. He rarely makes social media posts and in fact deleted his posts on Twitter and Instagram. He also rarely makes public appearances, in one case canceled a music festival appearance for no apparent reason. He resurfaced in late 2016 to promote his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramedy">dramedy</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Atlanta">Atlanta</a></em> and after it was announced he would be joining the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em>. Even now, the few appearances he makes are usually to promote something specific.

Since then, he's still uncomfortable with the spotlight, but has gradually gotten better at coping with it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MissyElliott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MissyElliott">Missy Elliott</a>, at the height of her career, simply vanished from the spotlight. In an interview, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">she stated</a> that this was due to her suffering from Graves' disease coupled with stress from the loss of her friend and collaborator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>. She later got her condition under control and made a well-received appearance at Super Bowl XLIX; whether that will make her any less reclusive is up in the air.
</li><li> Lee Mavers, leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas">The La's</a>, has something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> about this. He is often treated as a Reclusive Artist because of the band's failure to produce a second studio album for over twenty years, and the rarity of their live performances. However, he insists that he has a perfectly normal social life, and complains that the media describe him as a "recluse" just because he doesn't get photographed falling over outside fashionable nightclubs with a model on each arm.
</li><li> A long stretch of time passed by between the release of normally low-profile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a> co-founder Donald Fagen's 1982 solo debut <em>The Nightfly</em>, and its 1993 followup, <em>Kamikiriad</em>, upon which Fagen largely laid low aside from the occasional song written for a movie soundtrack ("True Companion" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a></em>; "Century's End" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrightLightsBigCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrightLightsBigCity">Bright Lights, Big City</a></em>), very sporadic songwriting for other music acts (Diana Ross, Manhattan Transfer, Yellowjackets and Jennifer Warnes, most notably) and the occasional live concert performance (usually charity shows in New York City). He began performing again with the "New York Rock'n'Soul Revue", a blues and jazz-based tour that occasionally saw him revisit some Steely Dan classics, in the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1980's</a>, and penned essays for <em>Premiere</em> magazine. After reuniting with Steely cofounder Walter Becker for <em>Kamikiriad</em>, the duo assembled a new band, went on the road as Steely Dan (their first tour since 1974) and have both (separately and together) kept a higher profile and constant touring ever since.
</li><li> Max Martin is pretty much the most influential pop music producer and songwriter in the world as he's written and produced more number one hit singles than any other producer in the world, second to only George Martin and Lennon/McCartney's songwriting. He's also known to shun all interviews and public appearances, save for limited industry appearances, and makes all the artists he works with fly to Sweden if they want to work with him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FionaApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FionaApple">Fiona Apple</a> has made it quite known that she dislikes fame and all the trappings that it brings and stays away from the public eye. After her last album in 2012, she does remain musically productive and shows up on the occasional collaboration or performance and wrote the opening theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAffair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAffair">The Affair</a></em>. She released an album in 2020 to critical acclaim, although she dropped it during a pandemic so she could avoid interviews.
</li><li> Frank Ocean burst onto the music scene with his association with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OFWGKTA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OFWGKTA">OFWGKTA</a> in 2008 and his own solo albums. But instead of capitalizing on the buzz of his critically acclaimed debut album <em>channel ORANGE</em>, he virtually disappeared and while he announced his intention to release his next album, <em>Boys Don't Cry</em>, he dropped off the radar again with no album in sight and people hungrily waiting for it. Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele">Adele</a></em>, who herself is somewhat notorious for her long wait times between albums, complained that she was impatient for his album. In August 2016, he finally delivered not one, but two albums: a visual album called <em>Endless</em>, and his long-awaited <em>Boys Don't Cry</em>, now re-titled <em>Blonde</em> with the original title reworked as a companion zine. He has been somewhat active on social media, posting the usual Instagram post or Tumblr update every few months and has been putting out singles as of late 2019, although his activity stopped after the sudden death of his younger brother Ryan in August 2020.
</li><li> Experimental electronic/R&amp;B artist Jai Paul is notorious for this, such as only having a twitter account with one tweet to address a leaked album back in 2013, giving very little interviews and very little live performances, next-to-nothing being known about his personal life, and most notoriously, only having released two or three singles since 2010 despite massive praise and buzz (aforementioned leaked album/demos not counting).
</li><li> Italian singer Mina stopped performing music and making public appearances in 1978, but it hasn't stopped her from recording new music on a yearly basis in addition to writing a weekly forum in the front page of <em>La Stampa</em> and a page in the Italian edition of the magazine <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/VanityFair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/VanityFair">Vanity Fair</a></em>, where she answers fan letters.
</li><li> The members of the obscure American-British girl group No Secrets have all but vanished from existence. Reportedly, Angel Faith is a doctor, Carly Lewis is married, Erin Tanner (now Nicki Foxx) is a solo artist, Jessica Fried (now Jessi Malay) is a solo artist as well, and Jade Ryusaki now resides in Hawaii as a model. Good luck trying to track them down!
</li><li> Mark Hollis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkTalk">Talk Talk</a> was a famous example, mainly due to the fact he himself <em>invoked</em> the trope. After the critical success of both of Talk Talk's final works (<em>Spirit of Eden</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaughingStock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaughingStock">Laughing Stock</a></em>, which are considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> of Post-Rock), Hollis quietly retired from the music industry. While he did release a self titled solo album afterwards, he again quietly retired to raise his family,and not much had been known where he was. The last anybody fully saw Hollis was in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234221">2004<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> to pick up a Pop Award for "It's My Life", and even then he picked it up <em>in the offices</em> instead of the actual award show. He became a mystique figure within the music world, and with the exception of him <a class="urllink" href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47680-talk-talks-mark-hollis-resurfaces-with-new-music-for-the-kelsey-grammer-tv-show-boss/">doing a commissioned piece<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the show <em>Boss</em> in 2012, he was never heard from again until his death at age 64 in 2019.
</li><li> Following her <em>1989</em> World Tour, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> took a deliberately long break from recording, writing and touring, releasing very few songs in 2015-2016 apart from a duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Zayn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Zayn">Zayn Malik</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesDarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesDarker">Fifty Shades Darker</a></em> ("I Don't Wanna Live Forever") and a co-write for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleBigTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleBigTown">Little Big Town</a> single, "Better Man" (arguably Taylor's first foray into country music since <em>Red</em>) and uncredited co-write with her then-boyfriend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CalvinHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CalvinHarris">Calvin Harris</a> ("This Is What You Came For"), along with various controversies and breakups in her personal life. In the summer of 2017, she erased every post on social media and unfollowed everyone she previously followed (save for Tumblr) and posted three cryptic videos showing the tail, body and head of a snake. In late August, she finally announced the November release of her sixth album in August, <em>reputation.</em>, along with releasing the lead single and its video, "Look What You Made Me Do", later in the month, but as of early September has yet to follow anyone again on social media and has posted few entries again on any of her accounts and has yet to really appear in public to promote her music or speak with fans online.
</li><li> German <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a>/Doom Metal band (DOLCH) have an impressive take on this trope: While they <em>do</em> perform live, <em>not much is known about them</em>. The band doesn't have any social media, doesn't conduct interviews, nor is it <em>known</em> what their line up is. All it's known is the band's lead by a mysterious female vocalist and a guitarist (and it's impossible to know if the known photos of another guitarist, bassist, and drummer are concrete as the band doesn't list members in their releases, instead using their band logo). Asking their label Ván Records about who they are or their lack of social media is also cryptic, as they too keep secret of who they are. All it's been known is the aforementioned core members, the two demos (and a compilation of said demos), a split with another band on the Ván Records label, the EP <em>An den Mond</em> and the recent release <em>III: Songs of Happiness...Words of Praise</em>.

In 1988, he bowed out of a Rat Pack reunion tour after only a short time on the job. He also declined to take part in a 1992 retrospective on Martin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis">Jerry Lewis</a> with his old comedy partner.

According to Noel Gallagher, Guigsy quit via fax and avoided phone calls from the Gallaghers in the following weeks. He declined to appear in the 2004 <em>Definitely Maybe</em> DVD, though a polite letter explaining his reasons for doing so appears as a hidden extra, along with a short segment with pundits giving their views on him. He also declined to be interviewed for the <em>Oasis: Supersonic</em> documentary, though archive footage of him was used instead.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael">George Michael</a> became a recluse in his last months, after checking out of rehab, to the point that the last photos taken prior to his death showed him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFit">suddenly gaining weight</a> along with rarely showing up in public in addition to battling his demons which caused his relationship with his cousin to end up being strained.

All we know about his true identity is his birthday, where he was born, where he attended school and university, and that his elder sister, Yumiko Kogure, is a former Tokyo Broadcasting System newscaster... and that's basically it.
</li><li> Rion Vernon, who many know as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoctorSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoctorSteel">Doctor Steel</a>, was this. All we know about his true identity is his real name, and after he retired his Doctor Steel persona, he vanished off the face of the earth for quite some time.

He also, along with Zach Manchester, very recently (in late 2019) started a company that designs and manufactures pseudo antiques.

</li></ul></li><li> Pianist Mike Lombardo use to post his songs on YouTube frequently and even had a chance to sign with a record label, but his career came to an end after he was convicted in 2012 for possessing child porn. Despite his release in 2018 he's completely vanished from the public eye, since one of his parole requirements involves having next to no access to the internet.
</li><li> Mexican singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas became this in 2002, when she vanished from the public eye, leaving some people making speculations on why she did such a thing during the peak of her career with battling bulimia, depression and social isolation (which she mentioned on her song "A 1000 X Hora") being a possible reason. Fortunately, sixteen years later, Thomas returned to the public eye by launching her Twitter account, with her first post explaining her absence along with revealing that she's now a mother of one and has since made a comeback.

<ul><li> Ace Frehley's replacement Vinnie Vincent was not seen publicly from 1996 until January <em>2018</em>. He returned to the public eye at the Atlanta KISS Expo (brought on by months of gentle prodding from a major fan, through Vincent's lawyer), and explained that his 22 year absence was a combination of his lengthy lawsuit against his former band, an abysmal marriage to his now deceased second wife, a disdain for social media, and a general feeling that no one cared about him anymore. Needless to say, he was wrong on that last part, as he got a warm reception, and even had fans fly in from all over the world to see and meet him (including one fan from Australia who had the autograph of every member of KISS except for his).
</li><li> Vincent's replacement Mark St. John basically disappeared from the industry after a collaboration with ex-Kiss drummer Peter Criss ended up failing miserably. He wasn't completely gone like Vinnie Vincent, but never did anything with any kind of profile again, and even spent time in jail prior to his death.

<ul><li> French Romantic poet Alfred de Vigny was notorious for his revulsion of public life. His self-imposed isolation and general aloofness were described by Sainte-Beuve, a famous literary critic of the time, as "withdrawing to the Ivory Tower", giving the expression its modern sense.

He created the legendary freeware game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> that later got a commercial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease">Updated Re Release</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare">WiiWare</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">made a few other games</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.vandal.net/12458/vm/13302725112007">gave a pair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.destructoid.com/cave-story-creator-talks-inspirations-sequel-and-more-168541.phtml">of interviews<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrugs Of God</a>, and... well, that's pretty much all we know about him.
</li><li> Shouzou Kaga, often credited as the brains behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>, helmed the first 5 installments of the series (from 1990 to 1999), and then abruptly left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> not too long after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral">Thracia 776</a></em>'s release. He then established his own studio, Tirnanog, and in 2001 made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TearRingSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TearRingSaga">Tear Ring Saga</a></em> for the PS1, which is so literally "<em>Fire Emblem</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">on the PlayStation</a>" that Nintendo sued him over it. Kaga seemed to escape the lawsuit relatively unscathed, made <em>Berwick Saga</em> (a semi-sequel to <em>TearRing</em>) in 2005. Then, for a good decade, Shouzou Kaga remained mostly silent, mostly blogging and working on projects that feel through prior to gaining any real ground (a Tear Ring Saga remake among them) Finally, in May of 2015, Shouzou Kaga broke his silence and announced a new SRPG, Vestaria Saga, which is currently under development.
</li><li> Not much is known about Kikiyama, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki">Yume Nikki</a></em>. She will occasionally respond to emails (which is the only reason fans even know she's a woman, as she refers to herself using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns">female pronouns</a> within them), but she generally stays very quiet indeed. Her website hasn't been updated in years and she hasn't made any games aside from <em>Yume Nikki</em>. Even after several high-profile derivative works based on the game were announced in 2013, she still hasn't stepped out of the shadows. Even after it was announced that she was personally involved in the follow-up announced in 2018, little is known about her.
</li><li> Dan and Sam Houser, the writers and producers of every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> game since the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em>, as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em>, tend to avoid the spotlight whenever possible.
</li><li> Matthew Smith, the programmer and designer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManicMiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManicMiner">Manic Miner</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetSetWilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetSetWilly">Jet Set Willy</a></em> became one of the few "name brands" of the UK games industry of the mid-'80s before announcing a new game, called <em>Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars</em> in the late-'80s and then seemingly walking off the face of the Earth. (<em>Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars</em> was finished by other coders and released as <em>Star Paws</em>.) In the '90s there was even a website called "Where is Matthew Smith?" featuring reports of "sightings" and speculation about where he had gone and/or what had happened to him. After all of that, Smith re-appeared via the internet at the end of the 1990s and is now fairly well-known amongst the retrogaming community, appearing at several live shows.
</li><li> Tori, the (former) head writer of AliceSoft, is in some ways a bit of a recluse. She has a blog where she talks about her everyday life and what it was like when she was a writer, and yet at the same time, barely anything is known about her, even her name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuSato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuSato">Osamu Sato</a>, who created some of the trippiest games ever, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LSDDreamEmulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LSDDreamEmulator">LSD: Dream Emulator</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EasternMindTheLostSoulsOfTongNou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EasternMindTheLostSoulsOfTongNou">Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong-Nou</a></em>, has no personal information listed for him anywhere. There are only a couple of webpages about him on the entire Internet, one of which lists a death date. However, this is untrue, as he still has an Instagram account which is updated fairly regularly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaroYoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaroYoko">Taro Yoko</a>, the director of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em> games considers most interviews a "boring chore" and often either looks away or dons a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">No. 7</a> mask in front of cameras. According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dualshockers.com/2017/03/12/yoko-taro-nier-automata-protagonist-2b-wears-high-heels-just-really-like-girls/">an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he is of the belief that creators should stay out of the public eye, stating that if he found out that the writer of an erotic novel series was a middle-aged man, he'd be disappointed.
</li><li> Icefrog, the developer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em>, has virtually no information known about him beyond his internet name and that he is an employee for Valve, working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em>.
</li><li> Shinichi Shimomura, one of the leading designers of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> series and the director of the Dark Matter Trilogy (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand2">Kirby's Dream Land 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand3">Kirby's Dream Land 3</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64TheCrystalShards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64TheCrystalShards">Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards</a></em>), vanished sometime after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure">Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land</a></em>'s release. Rumors suggest that he passed away in 2003, possibly in a car accident, but the lack of any information regarding Shimomura (to the point where only devoted <em>Kirby</em> fans are aware of his existence) leaves his fate inconclusive.
</li><li> Yasuyuki Hasebe who was the battle planner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a>, the battle designer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a> and most notably the director, writer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">and designer</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a> hasn't been seen since.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of the <em>Pokemon</em> franchise, rarely makes public appearances, though he is still very involved at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak">Game Freak</a> as its Executive Producer.
</li><li> Atsuko Nishida, the artist of many iconic Pokemon including Pikachu &amp; Bulbasaur, is notoriously camera-shy. Very few photos of her exist, and in 2018, she spent an entire interview hiding behind a giant Pikachu doll.
</li></ul></li><li> Hitoshi Akamatsu, who created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> and worked on the original NES trilogy, has vanished off the face of the Earth. Even his name was unknown to fandom for many years, and many people who worked at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> at the same time claimed to have never met him. (This seems to have been the case with many of the members of the original Castlevania team, however the rest of them have other credits and didn't just fade out of sight as Akamatasu did.) His only known interview was from a <a class="urllink" href="https://thearkhound.tumblr.com/post/180748437468/the-making-of-goonies-2">1987 magazine interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the making of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGoonies">The Goonies II</a></em>, which is the only time Konami has ever directly acknowledged Akamatsu's hand in the creation of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>.
</li><li> Very, very little is known about Carol, creator of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">ROM hack</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a></em>. They have no social media presence, no personal information is known about them in general and they've done no interviews online about their work whatsoever. Then again, this is also kind of a trend with Japanese ROM hack authors as a whole, with the people behind <em>Super Mario World YEAHH</em>, <em>Scarlet Devil Mario</em> and <em>Super Mario LD</em> being equally reclusive and hard to find out about online.
</li><li> Zig-zagged by Tarn "Toady One" Adams of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> fame. While he's very willing to give interviews and attends the occasional con, in his personal life he seems to spend most of his time holed up in his apartment, sleeping during the day and working at night and living mainly off Quiznos sandwiches and Dr Pepper. After the <em>New York Times</em> article that brought his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikkikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikkikomori">hikkikomori</a> tendencies to the attention of the fans there was a rather heartwarming outpouring of concern for his long-term health and offers to send him some proper food or even find him a live-in housekeeper.
</li><li> Vince Perri, creator of the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52">Action 52</a></em>. Initially, he was relatively active in the game's marketing, even showcasing it at a Consumer Electronics Show. After the game's dismal reception, however, he disappeared from the public eye. Very little is known about him, and there are no pictures of him anywhere.
</li><li> Iron Tower Studio game designer Vince D. Weller, who served as director for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAgeOfDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAgeOfDecadence">The Age of Decadence</a></em>, is actually operating under an alias, and while active in terms of communication, it's only when it concerned the game. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/02/01/against-design-decadence-vince-d-weller/">An interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with Rock Paper Shotgun revealed that this a necessity due to him already working at another company, thus not allowing him to manage other businesses openly.
</li><li> Akira Kitamura, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>, seems to prefer being out of the spotlight in relation to his famous creation. He only directed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">two</a> games in the series, but left Capcom shortly after the second game was finished and eventually left the video game industry altogether after trying to strike out on his own for a bit. Since then, he has only given a few interviews.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sayori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sayori">Sayori</a>, main writer and illustrator of the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Nekopara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Nekopara">Nekopara</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/RPGSite/status/749815992474144768">Sekai Project asked his guests to not take any pictures or videos at her panel on Anime Expo 2016.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Jeff Spangenberg was the founder of Iguana Entertainment and became a high ranking executive in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Acclaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Acclaim">Acclaim Entertainment</a> after being bought out by them. After being fired from Acclaim for undisclosed reasons, he partnered with Nintendo to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios">Retro Studios</a>, but Nintendo bought out his stake in the company due to mismanagement and the discovery that he had been misusing funds and hardware to host a lewd website. After this, he founded the short-lived Top Heavy Studios and created <em>The Guy Game</em>, an erotic party game that flopped with critics and in sales and was banned from stores due to the inadvertent inclusion of an underaged girl. Despite previously being a rather high profile game developer, Jeff Spangenberg has seemingly disappeared from public life after the failure of <em>The Guy Game</em>, with him refusing requests for interviews, having no real online presence, no more involvement in the game industry, and his current whereabouts and activities are unknown.
</li><li> Sivak Games, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleKid">Battle Kid</a></em> and its sequel. Other than his infrequently-updated YouTube channel, he has no online presence to speak of. Almost nothing is known about his personal life (other than that he's an American currently working in Japan), to the extent that nobody even seems to know his real name.

In an interview, she said this was due to her social anxiety.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaYoung">Linda Young</a>, the English voice of Frieza in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> and Genkai in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. For years, she had never done an interview, and for the longest time, her only convention was in 1999. She's still active as a voice actress but has a reputation for being a bit mysterious. In 2015, Young finally appeared at a convention where she was in a panel with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyuseiNakao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyuseiNakao">Ryusei Nakao</a>, Frieza's Japanese voice actor. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/VDvgslZlSMw">They even shared a laugh together.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> These days, she's slowly making the rounds at a few conventions a year, and she says she was nervous to do so for a long time because she wasn't sure what to expect.

Despite being extremely active in the Canadian voiceover industry, very little is known about her personal life, she rarely attends conventions, and wouldn't allow a photo of herself to be used on Behind the Voice Actors.

She was replaced with Kira Tozer for <em>InuYasha: The Final Act</em> with little explanation.

Little is known about her current life (other than living in Baltimore and trying to pursue a career in animation), she's not as active online as her fellow voice actresses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaireCorlett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaireCorlett">Claire Corlett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleCreber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleCreber">Michelle Creber</a>, and rarely attends conventions.
</li><li> Mimi Woods, best known for providing the voice of Major Kusanagi in the English dub of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> film and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PS1</a> game, has almost completely vanished off the face of the earth following her handful of anime and video game roles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryElizabethMcGlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryElizabethMcGlynn">Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</a>, who took over her role of the Major for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Stand Alone Complex</a></em> anime, acknowledged at a convention panel that Woods had moved away and retired from voice acting.
</li><li> Evetta Muradasilova, best known as the voice behind the Plain Doll and Lady Maria from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> and the Maiden in Black from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>. While there is a photo or two floating around the internet, many people are unsure if it's even really <em>her</em> to begin with.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottFreeman">Scott Freeman</a> has completely disappeared from the anime community since his 2015 conviction for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt">possessing child porn</a>, a part of this obviously stems from his parole allowing limited travel and internet access. The only info about him since then was his employment at a bar in Texas before <a class="urllink" href="https://sor.nebraska.gov/Registry/Offender/201810XPL">moving to Nebraska<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> around late 2018.
</li><li> Oliver Grainger, known for being one of the many D.W's in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> and Dongwa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SagwaTheChineseSiameseCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SagwaTheChineseSiameseCat">Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat</a></em>, has retired from voice acting and is mostly private, though he has a presence on Instagram... which he updates once in a while. He used to be on Facebook, however when a fan found out he was there, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">he deleted his Facebook page</a>.
</li><li> Jesse Vinet, Oliver's fellow <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SagwaTheChineseSiameseCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SagwaTheChineseSiameseCat">Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat</a></em> voice actor (she was Sheegwa), has also retired from voice acting, has moved to Singapore, and now works for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> as an Assistant Communications Manager. She barely has a social media presence and all we know is who her current employer is, and that's she married to a man named Jin Yan Chay, as stated in a Legacy.com obituary for a relative. However, statements on her LinkedIn page and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/ubisoftsingapore/posts/5-questions-with-our-new-assistant-communications-manager-jesse-vinet-welcome-to/10154793046399460/">one interview with Ubisoft Singapore<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have helped to form a sort of biography for her.
</li><li> Michael Yarmush, the original voice of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>, is another Montreal talent who is impossible to track down. The only known photo of him was taken in the late '90s when he was still a child, and he has no social media presence.
</li><li> Neil Shee of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToadPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToadPatrol">Toad Patrol</a></em> fame is a very mysterious man, his last credit being rather fairly recent, in 2017 for the short <em>Arthur, their very own child</em>. He does have a biography though.
</li><li> Rick Jones and Terrence Scammell are other notable Montreal talent who are this trope. They both have very few photos on the internet and don't have social media presences.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilaryHaag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilaryHaag">Hilary Haag</a> has been one of the most prominent anime voice actresses since the late 90s (best known for her lead roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories">Ghost Stories</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChildrenWhoChaseLostVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChildrenWhoChaseLostVoices">Children Who Chase Lost Voices</a></em> among many others), and still gets plenty of work, but she never attends any conventions, rarely does interviews, and has completely shied away from social media. She has emphasised that anime voice acting is very much a side gig for her and that her day job takes up most of her time.
</li><li> Haruka Nakamura, who voiced the titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMilkChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMilkChan">Super Milk Chan</a></em>, of which was her only role. She vanished off the face of the earth after that and her current whereabouts are unknown.
<ul><li> To a lesser extent Brad Pyutt, the seiyu for Hanage. All we know is that may have been another seiyu using a pseudonym.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieKavner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieKavner">Julie Kavner</a>, the voice of Marge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> (alongside minor roles Patty and Selma), is a very, very private person. She even has a clause in her contract that explicitly states that she's not required to make public appearances or promote the series.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3s07q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3s07q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3s07q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As such, she is the lone person of the core six voice actors of the show to have never lent her voice to any of the popular Butterfingers commercials and while <em>Marge</em> herself appeared in the ads, she remains voiceless. Tellingly, even fellow core <em>Simpsons</em> voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryShearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryShearer">Harry Shearer</a>—himself a downplayed example of this trope—has lent his voice to the ads, in addition to guest voices Pamela Hayden, who voices Milhouse and the late Russi Taylor and Marcia Wallace, who voiced Martin Prince and Mrs. Krabappel, respectively.</span> She also refuses to be photographed at work or perform Marge's voice outside the studio. When she appeared alongside the <em>Simpsons</em> cast on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InsideTheActorsStudio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InsideTheActorsStudio">Inside the Actors Studio</a></em>, the broadcast episode had to play clips of Marge on-screen when she did the voice, whereas the rest of the cast performed their characters on camera. She's mostly retired from acting now, except for her roles on <em>The Simpsons</em>.
</li><li> Christina Lange, a former child actress and voice actress of the 1980s and early '90s, seems to have vanished after the endings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates">Peter Pan &amp; the Pirates</a></em> in the former she was Velma and Wendy in the latter, her current status and whereabouts are unknown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> VA Jackie Buscarino is known to take frequent hiatuses on her social media, with one or two updates being posted every few months. Even then these posts usually have little to do with new projects she's cast in.
</li><li> Despite her iconic status, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaniceKawaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaniceKawaye">Janice Kawaye</a> tends to keep a very low profile. <em>Very</em> few current photos of her can be found online, and no interviews with her exist to this day. She also has no social media of any kind, and most likely never has.
</li><li> Lana Beeson, a former child actress, voice actress and singer of the 1980s, best known for being the voice of Twinkle the girl who was turned into a singing puppet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinocchioAndTheEmperorOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinocchioAndTheEmperorOfTheNight">Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night</a></em> and the singing voice of Anne Marie in <em></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllDogsGoToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllDogsGoToHeaven">All Dogs Go to Heaven</a>'', the later is her last known work, her current status and whereabouts are unknown.
</li><li> Janna Michaels, a child actress who appeared in a number of live-action film and TV appearances in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> (including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bushwhacked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bushwhacked">Bushwhacked</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleGiants">Little Giants</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, and whose highest-profile work was as the voice actress for Molly Cunningham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>, seems to have dropped off the radar after her last role in 1997 in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman">Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</a></em> episode.
</li><li> Xavier Pritchett, who voiced the titular character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBill">Little Bill</a> seemingly vanished off the face of the earth after the series ended in 2004, and his current status and whereabouts are unknown.
</li><li> Very little is known about voice actress Cindy McGee, who is best known for voicing Shana and Krissie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>. She retired from the profession two years after the cartoon ended in 1988 and has never attended any fan conventions, not even the annual JemCons.
</li><li> Former child actor Zach Tyler Eisen, the voice actor for Aang from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> (as well as Pablo the Penguin in earlier seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans">The Backyardigans</a></em> and Lucas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAntBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAntBully">The Ant Bully</a></em>), is one of the only major living VAs from the show to not attend any fan events since its conclusion, despite the show's immense popularity to this day and Eisen voicing the show's <em>main character</em>. All his verified social media accounts are either closed or private. It is known that he attended Syracuse University and currently works as a photographer for the Conde Nast group (indeed, his name can be seen in the credits for several Vogue interviews) but very little is known aside from that, due to zero fan interactions. Ultimately, he finally resurfaced in a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeB2sgZTEG8">2020 interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where he revealed that he mainly stayed out of the spotlight because he just wanted to live a normal life, but still maintains a huge amount of respect for the show.
</li><li> The North American Cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMrMenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMrMenShow">The Mr. Men Show</a></em> has some voice actors that used pseudonyms for their credits in the show. In recent years, names of the unknown actors were revealed.
<ul><li> Mr. Bump's actor was credited as "Aaron Albertus", but the name led to nowhere. It wasn't until the credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatchTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatchTheMovie">Yo-kai Watch: The Movie</a></em> where it's confirmed that his voice actor was actually Paul Greenberg, who had previously played several minor roles in TV series, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>. Seeing as how the show is non-union and Greenberg is a SAG actor, he had to use a pseudonym for voice credits but since he freelance wrote for the show, his real name was allowed for writing credits.
</li><li> The same goes with Jospheh J. Terry, which like with Paul Greenberg was revealed to be Joey J. D'Auria.
</li><li> The name for Miss Bossy and Miss Curious' actress Sophie Roberts leads to a pseudonym of Michelle Ruff, but she stated that she never worked for the show. It was later revealed by Cheryl Chase's LinkedIn page that she was the voice to Miss Bossy (unsurprising given who Chase is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">best known for voicing</a>, whose series Risley did storyboarding for).
</li><li> The name "Danny Katiana" for both Mr. Nosy and Nervous was ambiguous for several years, until it was revealed that it was yet another pseudonym, this time for Rick Zieff (best known as Shusuke Amagai from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>) after he did a Talking Voices video in 2020 when he told that he voices Olivia's dad in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Olivia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Olivia">Olivia</a>.
</li><li> Jeff Stewart (Mr. Tickle) was an odd example, as it is his real name, but it leads to a British actor who never did any voice work for cartoons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats">The Aristocats</a></em>:
<ul><li> Late actor Gary Dubin (voice of Toulouse) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">didn't have that much work in film and television</a>, he did make some live-action appearances as a reporter in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em>, and an ill-fated teenager in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2">Jaws 2</a></em>. He was a very private person and spent the remaining 54 years of his life with his family and friends. It wasn't until October 8, 2016 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1273271019370440">when a relative confirmed his passing of bone cancer.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Unlike Gary Dubin and Liz "Louise" English, there's very little information about Dean Clark (voice of Berlioz). Since the film's release, he never returned to acting and completely vanished off the face of the earth.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Russian mathematical genius <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman">Grigori Perelman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is notorious for his refusal to travel abroad to accept prestigious awards (including one with a $1,000,000 prize), or even leaving his tiny St. Petersburg apartment at all. Reportedly, he can stay indoors for weeks, shuns personal contact with other people, and refuses to speak to anyone but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">his mother</a>. All of this is enough to declare him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs">patron saint of nerddom</a>.
<ul><li> Pioneering physical scientist Henry Cavendish and theoretical physicist Paul Dirac were similar. Dirac preferred solitude and hated socializing, and Cavendish hated all forms of personal contact, instructing his servants to ignore his presence if they encountered him and communicate only by notes.
</li></ul></li><li> Aside from the opinions put forth on his blog, nothing else is really known about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanMalstrom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanMalstrom">Sean Malstrom</a>. As with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg">Seltzer and Friedberg</a> above, this is probably because of the havoc that would erupt if he were to make his presence known elsewhere on the internet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em> creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersChaps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersChaps">The Brothers Chaps</a>, were quite open with their fanbase, making public appearances and even featuring their children in some shorts, but in 2009 they started to appear less and less, which has been attributed to the birth of Matt's second daughter and work burnout (having produced content nearly every week from 2002 to late 2009.) In 2014, they broke the silence and confirmed the return of Homestar Runner, even saying they hadn't planned on the hiatus being so long. Even with that, they're only open about themselves and the content they provide and keep nearly everything else private.
</li><li> After <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer">Bobby Fischer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lost the title of World Champion in 1975 (well, forfeited—he demanded specific rules for the tournament that the World Chess Federation would not agree to, so he refused to play), he basically retired from chess and from the public eye for nearly 20 years, living a reclusive life until an anniversary rematch against old foe Boris Spassky (who he defeated to win the title of World Champion in the first place) in 1992.
<ul><li> That match would indirectly lead to Fischer's downward spiral. The 1992 Fischer-Spassky match was played in what was then known as Yugoslavia, which was under embargo from the UN and the U.S. during the bloody conflict in that region. After President Bush Sr. issued an executive order that the U.S. would comply with the UN's embargo of Yugoslavia, Fischer, an American citizen at the time, was told that playing the match in Belgrade would violate US and international law. Fischer appeared in a press conference where he spat on a copy of the president's executive order and played the match anyway. After the match, Fischer would spend the last years of his life fearing legal action in the U.S., going from country to country seeking asylum, attempting to renounce his citizenship and publicly making anti-American statements before settling in Iceland.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisMorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisMorris">Chris Morris</a>, who wrote things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrassEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrassEye">Brass Eye</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourLions">Four Lions</a></em>, barely makes public appearances and almost never does interviews, so much so that for his official biography the writer had to talk to people who knew Morris rather than Morris himself. He did briefly pop up in public quite a bit due to the release of his film <em>Four Lions</em> but has since disappeared again.
</li><li> British comedian Daniel Kitson is impossible to get interviews with and has said that he never wants to do TV work again. There's also no DVDs or CDs of his stand-up because he feels that it loses the feel of live performance. Probably his biggest TV appearance was on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PhoenixNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PhoenixNights">Phoenix Nights</a></em> as Spencer, which he hated so much that it drove him away completely from doing any TV work. Hes explained thats just because he doesn't want mainstream recognition as it attracts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a>. And aside from that, he tours often, has an active public life, and is said to be very charismatic in person. He also has a Bandcamp. <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/robotbotch/status/379019449959186432">In the words of Rob Batchelor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Kitson is the JD Salinger of comedy, if JD Salinger regularly released new work, wasn't a recluse, and was regularly seen in public.
</li><li> Al Yeganeh, the soupman that inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">the Soup Nazi</a>. Oddly enough, Yeganeh operated his restaurant without much hassle for years after the episode aired, and even invited interviews as long as there was no mention of <em>Seinfeld</em> or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">the N word</a>", since he's Jewish. He did, though, shun the spotlight when he re-formatted his Soup Kitchen into the <em>Original Soupman</em> franchise and no-showed its grand re-opening. Since going corporate, Yeganeh has had little public presence (although his likeness still serves as the company logo), probably at the insistence of shareholders who prefer more PR-friendly personalities as active spokespersons, such as Reggie Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal, both of whom are also investors in the company. Reportedly, Yeganeh sold his share of the company but lives somewhere near the New York Location.
</li><li> Matt Drudge, creator of the famed Drudge Report. Though he had a show on Fox News and published a book in the early 2000s, he has been inaccessible since 2004 or so. He still maintains (and makes a lot of money from) his famous website, but barely grants interviews and practically nothing is known about his current personal life.
</li><li> Bettie Page, the famed pin-up model. After 1958 or so, she converted to Christianity and wanted to bury her modeling past as much as possible. Despite her resurgence in popularity in the 1980s, she barely granted interviews and did not allow current photos of herself to be published. Part of this attitude may have due to her schizophrenia diagnosis in the late 1970s. She wasn't even aware of her newfound popularity until an interviewer in the early 1990s pointed it out.
</li><li> Even small-scale popularity can have this happen. Some artists may be constantly bombarded with messages discussing commissions, people wanting to be their friends, or dealing with web-drama amongst their existing friends so getting a hold of them is <em>quite</em> difficult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG">Dino Attack RPG</a></em>:
<ul><li> Over time in the RPG, many of the players got to know each other on a surprisingly personal level, up to and including revealing their real names (or at least their first name) and a general idea of where they live (so far as nationality and hometown anyway, precise addresses were obviously not given). The one exception is PeabodySam, who, while fairly personal with other players, seems to make a point of stating as little about himself as possible. He has dropped hints, but how reliable any of them are is debatable. The most he has ever said is that he claims to be a 101-year-old man who lives somewhere in the United States.
</li><li> Most players who left the RPG also tended to disappear from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/BZPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/BZPower">BZPower</a> around the same time, and as a result they are all difficult to track down and can be considered reclusive artists, especially due to the anonymous nature of BZPower usernames. There are exceptions, such as Chronicler of Ko-Koro and Canama, who are still active in the online LEGO community. However, by far the most infamous example of this in <em>Dino Attack RPG</em> would be Kotua in Space, who not only disappeared from BZPower but also Brickshelf, MOCpages, and many other websites all at the same time in late 2007 so he could focus on schoolwork.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat subverted with Ashida Kim: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> master and author of a large number of ninja books that were part of the ninja-mania of the 1980s. For a ninja, he's not quite reclusive enough. He has given interviews, made public appearances, has a YouTube channel, attended martial arts conventions and seminars (usually smaller ones and not those hosted by nationally or internationally recognized mainstream organizations), and hosts a forum on his own website (although it's become evident that many past posts by him might have been by moderators that he appoints). The issue with him is that he is very elusive about his martial arts credentials leading many to assume that he's a fake, fraud, and charlatan. It can be argued that Ashida does avoid most public appearances in the mainstream martial arts scene where his credentials would be critically reviewed. He apparently restricts himself to those underground scenes populated by fellow "questionable figures" such as Frank Dux and Irving Soto. And, as has been rightfully pointed out <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/mg2I6ZSWO-4">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a person who has actually done the kind of undercover ninja things that Ashida Kim claims to have done would logically avoid public appearances.
</li><li> The owner of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mugumogu">Maru<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, arguably the most famous cat featured on YouTube. The channel has over 200 million views and is the 7th most subscribed channel in Japan, but Maru's owner/s has never been seen on-screen and no one has any idea what they look like outside of the fact that at least one is female. This is strange, considering the worldwide popularity of the channel and the fact that someone somewhere would likely recognize the apartment and/or cats seen in the videos or associated blog. Various attempts to contact Maru's owner have always resulted in failure - the agent representing Maru refuses to send correspondence from fans to said owner(s), and despite it being a huge moneymaker, no one can get a hold of said owner outside of a single interview they granted to a Japanese cat blog.
</li><li> Animation writer Merriwether Williams, who has written on cartoons like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, is very reclusive. There's only one known photo of her online, only one known interview with her, and for a while she was the only "Pony" writer who never made public appearances in cons.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> celebrity Miss Hannah Minx left the Internet in late 2013, leaving all her profiles unattended. The crowd-funded film she was supposed to star in was never made. Allegedly, she got bored of her Japanophile persona, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MissHannahMinx/comments/37ai9x/hannah_is_married_with_children_now/">got married, had children<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and disappeared off the radar to raise her kids. Still it's surprising that, in this day and age, and with such an active fanbase, nobody managed to confirm this or find anything more about her.
</li><li> The person who makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HowToBasic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HowToBasic">HowToBasic</a> might be this, by virtue of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">The Faceless</a> in all of his videos. The public doesn't know Mr. Basic's identity because his face is never shown.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe">James Rolfe</a>, also known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a>, has no problem talking about himself or his childhood, as shown in his many videos he has shared on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cinemassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cinemassacre">Cinemassacre</a>. Anything involving his family, especially his wife and two daughters? Under lock and key. While his wife has assisted on many of his AVGN videos, she herself has never appeared in person in them, and is always referred to as "Mrs. Nerd" in credits of his works. He also has an unlisted phone number and address.
</li><li> Despite his millions of views and his 3.1 million subscribers, nearly nothing is known about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GradeAUnderA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GradeAUnderA">GradeAUnderA</a> except that he's British and used to be a math tutor. To date, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/W1ZHLcBYS3o?t=3m52s">he has done a face reveal for his 2 million subscriber milestone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Ko4leGFOGx8?t=8m4s">another video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> revealed his real name to be Ram although this is entirely unintentional on his part.
</li><li> Similar to the above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/IHateEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/IHateEverything">I Hate Everything</a>, also known as Alex, has also never shown his face in his videos and prefers to keep it that way. This later turned into a joke on his own videos, showing everything EXCEPT his face. That said, he does show his face regularly now on JAR Media, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel run by Alex and his friends.
</li><li> For several years YouTuber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMysteriousMrEnter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMysteriousMrEnter">The Mysterious Mr. Enter</a> only represented himself with a static cartoon avatar. It wasn't until two years after he started making videos that he made a live-action video of himself showing his face and finally revealing his real name. Even now, Enter seldom talks to others online (outside of his Tumblr where he answers questions) and does not share his e-mail or Skype with anyone but his very close friends/workers for his projects. He also closed his twitter in 2020, and in mid-July left deviantART as well, making him more, well, mysterious.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MonsterJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MonsterJam">Monster Jam</a> drivers vanished off the face of the Earth after retirement. Notable examples are Gary Porter and Brian Barthel.

</li><li> Willard Scott. In addition to having no known social media, his centenarian birthday segments on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today">Today</a></em> were being shown less and less frequently in the months leading up to his 2015 retirement, and even then, at that point they were no longer being done live, but filmed sporadically. Before then, the most noteworthy news about him was in spring 2014 when he remarried. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> since he's in his eighties and had to take time to slow down.
</li><li> Speaking of the <em>Today</em> show, longtime film critic Gene Shalit literally disappeared after he left the show sometime in 2011. His most recent appearance was in 2015 after Willard's retirement.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/reclusive-marvel-ceo-ike-perlmutter-photographed-public-959632">Until 2016<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the only known picture of current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelStudios">Marvel Studios</a> chairman Issac "Ike" Perlmutter was taken in 1985. Perlmutter was rumored to have attended the premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">Iron Man</a></em> in disguise and apparently prides himself on having never given an interview.
</li><li> Fitness guru Richard Simmons is a rather disturbing instance of this. After decades of being an extrovert, he suddenly vanished from the public eye. According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-where-are-they-now-stories-that-sound-completely-made-up/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> article, the general conception is that he's being held captive inside his own house and whoever is doing so to him is cutting him off from society. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.today.com/popculture/richard-simmons-today-show-no-one-holding-me-my-house-t79821">He did give a phone-in interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today">Today</a> Show</em>, saying that he actually wasn't being held captive and simply didn't want to be in the public eye... which people immediately took as being exactly what someone being held captive would say. The theory took a big hit when he reemerged into the public eye in 2017 to sue the <em>National Enquirer</em> for claiming he'd had a sex-change operation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mfly');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mfly" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mfly');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He lost, due to not providing enough evidence that the story had negatively impacted his life.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows">Todd in the Shadows</a> is kind of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> example because we know his real name (Kenneth Munson - Todd Nathanson" is a pseudonym) and he interacts with fans, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">he always wears a mask over the top half of his face</a>, not wanting people to know what he looks like. Heck, technically we don't even know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">what race he is</a>, which is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>.

His real name, his face, even his age are all left a mystery, with trolls only going by breadcrumbs Ghost occasionally lets out to piece together things. Though considering his opinions, this may be down to protect himself.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amoridere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amoridere">Amoridere</a>, from what can be guessed, is pretty secretive (and shy), so most of what's known about her is what she's said in the descriptions of her works, what's shown in her photos, said on her social media, or if one asks her, which isn't much besides that she lives somewhere in southwestern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio">Ohio</a>, parts of her name, and the fact that she spends/spent much of her time at home (according to her earlier photos).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic">Troll Fic</a> writer BoxOfScraps, who wrote many fics consisting of an over-the-top depiction of some show and/or other piece of media being interrupted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> killing the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">for no reason</a>. To this day, nobody has claimed responsibility for the fanfics, all of which were published in 2010, and nobody has been able to find out the true identity of this infamous troll fic writer, though it's believed BoxofScraps was run by the same person as the now-defunct @Real_Hulk Twitter account.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BarneyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BarneyBunch">Barney Bunch</a> video makers fall under this trope. Then again, it's probably for their protection knowing that the Bunch is a known trolling group.
</li><li> Special effects artist <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobBottin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobBottin">Rob Bottin</a></em> has become this since his retirement, aside from appearing in the documentary "Fantastic Flesh" and making a comic con appearance for his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHowling">The Howling</a></em>, he rarely makes public appearances or gives interviews, and has no social media.
</li><li> Jamie Hyneman, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> fame, was never truly comfortable with the public attention he received because of the show. Once <em>MythBusters</em> ended, he ended his partnership with Adam Savage and downsized M5 Industries to focus on prototyping and engineering projects that interest him personally. His public appearances are sporadic and small-scale and mainly aimed at getting people interested in science and engineering.

All we know is the Citizen's gender (male) and nationality (American). Then again, this might be for his protection, given that he has expressed controversial opinions that border on anti-consumerism. Also, if his identity were to be exposed, he would be targeted for lawsuits by many of the corporations and people he's covered, not to mention harassment by trolls.
</li><li> John J.B. Wilson, the founder of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward">Golden Raspberry Awards</a>. Aside from personal details, he is quite the recluse and has no social media profiles. Though, like with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg">Seltzer and Friedberg</a>, it's likely he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">protecting himself and his family</a> rather than just avoiding people.
</li><li> The operators of most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTubeKidsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTubeKidsChannel">YouTube Kids Channels</a>. Though considering the content of said channels, it's likely for their protection.

However, he's since then disappeared with the informal farewell to his fanbase being an interview he gave explaining his absence and plans to retire to focus on his job and marriage. He's also revealed he's never been that open about his channel in his personal life anyways. Since then, information about him had been altered and pictures have been removed wherever possible to respect his privacy, including on this very wiki.
</li><li> Charles Sonnenburg aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> is another online personality who doesn't show his face. That said, he is active on Twitter and does interact with others.

The only thing we know for sure is that Babi more or less abandoned her account to share one with Jen, hence why the latter interacts with fans more often.
</li><li> ThoseDudesWithAHat, the creator of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheReviewReviewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheReviewReviewer">The Review Reviewer</a>. All we know is that he nicknames himself "Timber" as evidenced by his DeviantArt page.

He never appeared in real-life vlogs of the group and the only time he was seen on camera was wearing a horse mask. This changed in 2013 when he surprised his fans with a face reveal during an RTX panel. Since then he's dropped the secrecy and has shown himself on camera more often.
</li><li> Downplayed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SovietWomble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SovietWomble">Soviet Womble</a>: He's not particularly secretive about his personal life, but he refuses to <em>ever</em> show his face on camera while streaming; partly because he considers it vain, but also because he'd rather not get hassled by fans in the street. (Rumours that he really <em>is</em> a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWombles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWombles">womble</a> are strenuously denied.)) The only part of him that's ever been seen on camera is a hand either petting or feeding a dog treat to his beloved French Bulldog Lulu.
