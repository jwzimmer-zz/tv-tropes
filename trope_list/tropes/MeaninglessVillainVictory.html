<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Freeza successfully gathers all the Namekian Dragon Balls thanks to the Ginyu Force and wishes for immortality. But without knowing the Namekian language or the dragon Porunga's name, he can't even summon it, much less make a wish; to add insult to injury, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire">he killed just about everyone who could have told him the password</a>. Later, Freeza gets to Porunga and wishes for it before Dende can wish Namek's residents off the exploding planet. However, since Freeza can't speak Namekian, his wish is ignored and Dende's, which was spoken in said language, is granted instead. Even if he could learn the language, since he was fighting off Goku, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whose best friend he blew up on top of all the murders he had committed</span>, his plans were at an end.
</li><li> Vegeta manages to get Dende to make the wish to make Vegeta immortal... but just before Dende finishes making the wish, Guru dies, and since the Dragon Balls become useless if their creator dies, the dragon vanishes and Vegeta remains mortal.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZDeadZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZDeadZone">Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone</a></em>, the villain Garlic Jr. actually obtains immortality... before being sealed in an empty dimension. He <em>does</em> escape, however, as he can channel power from a celestial object in the main series dimension... but Gohan destroys the celestial object and sends Garlic Jr. back into that dimension, this time for good.
</li><li> Despite being killed early on in the Cell Saga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr. Gero</a> ultimately achieved his lifelong goal: Goku died at the hands of Cell, his greatest creation. Of course, right afterwards, Cell is killed by Gohan, and Goku comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> seven years later, with power that completely dwarfs Perfect Cell to boot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>: At the end of the Future Trunks Saga, Zamasu ultimately manages to wipe out humanity in Future Trunks' timeline after becoming a universe-spanning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. But his victory is immediately undone thanks to Goku being friends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Zen'o</a>, which allowed Goku to call him in and resulted in Zen'o erasing him from existence. What's more, in the end, he was unable to kill his most hated enemies and, with the knowledge of what happened, Whis makes sure Zamasu's future self is stopped before he can enact his plans while Future Trunks and Mai live happily in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">Close-Enough Timeline</a>. In the end, Zamasu's plans ultimately amounted to nothing.
</li><li> By the nature of the work, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> is excessively fond of these. Since Lupin is a criminal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">technically a villainous character</a>, and chased by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">a good guy upholding the law</a>, examples are limited to when a third party is competing against Lupin and the gang.
<ul><li> <strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LupinIIIS2E52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LupinIIIS2E52">"Emmanuelle in Bangkok"</a></strong>: Lupin allows Fujiko and Emmanuelle to fight over the treasure, a box made to contain the Scripture of Immortality or the "Fountain of Youth", as it might otherwise be known. It's crumbled to dust.
</li><li> Another caper set around Christmas time had Lupin and the gang managing to steal a vintage and princless wine and swap it with a garden variety one along with a crate that they think is money. However, when they drink the wine itself, they find out it tastes horrible (which likewise saved Zenegatia's hide, as it kept the U.S delegates from tasting it), but that crate turned out to be filled with dolls which were supposed to be delivered to kids for Christmas. At least Lupin realizes his mistake on this and air-dropped the dolls across the land as an apology.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>: When the crew goes off on an S-Ranked mission to save an island from a curse that turns them into demons, they find that there is a demon on the island that was sealed away in ice and the villains are trying to thaw it out so the main villain of that arc and kill it and thus surpass his master, who sacrificed herself to seal it in the first place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The villains manage it, only to find that it was already dead. Turns out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">being frozen in ice for several years is fatal</a> even to demons.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, the heretic witch Arachne spends a good deal of resources sending an army to an island where the good guys are also assembled, all to recover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientArtifact">the Demon Tool BREW</a>. When her man finally succeeds in recovering the mystic tool, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it is broken beyond repair.</span> However, it is subverted in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Medusa had actually switched the real BREW out for a fake. BREW itself was still usable and eventually falls into the hands of another villain, but as far as Arachne is concerned, it is played straight</span>. Even so, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">BREW being broken doesn't actually change Arachne's plans at all. She may not have the working tool, but her enemies don't <em>know</em> that, so she is able to use the empty <em>threat</em> of using the tool as a way to lure her enemies into the open when they attempt to stop her from using it.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>, Yukari and Nyamo bet ten thousand yen on the outcome of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a>. Yukari's class wins, Nyamo hands her the money... and then Nyamo points out that Yukari borrowed ten thousand yen from her a while back. <em>Yoink!</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09dzs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09dzs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09dzs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although Yukari <em>is</em> still ten thousand yen up as her debt has been cleared, knowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">what she's like</a>, Nyamo probably assumed Yukari would never pay her back anyway and was taking her only chance to get her money back.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>
<ul><li> To say the results of the Whitebeard War were mixed for the Marines is to sugarcoat it. Both the Marines and the World Government ended up much worse off in the long run, even if they completed their initial objective of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Ace and Whitebeard, thus ending Gold Roger's family line</span>. But now, the Marines have a pirate on the rise with <em>two</em> Devil Fruit powers, one of which is Whitebeard's stolen quake ability, and absolutely none of the self-control to go with it. Also, several Level Six Impel Down prisoners are on the loose, thousands of Marines are dead, and the worst generation of pirates (the Eleven Supernovas) are wreaking absolute havoc in the New World. Akainu is now Fleet Admiral, so more needless civilian deaths and property damage abound. They've also lost three major assets (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sengoku, Garp, and Aokiji</span>) due to disgust with how the World Government handled it all: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement">essentially, pretend the breakouts at Impel Down didn't happen</a>. To top it all off, this was supposed to act as a warning to pirates everywhere, just like Gold Roger's death, and snuff out the Golden Age of Piracy. But, thanks to Whitebeard's proclamation that One Piece exists being heard around the world, he ended up starting an entirely <em>new</em> age of piracy. The World Government and Marines were better off when the Golden Age of Piracy was in full swing.
</li><li> A lesser-scale example is in the Dressrosa arc, chapter 742: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Usopp is the only person left who can knock out Sugar and return all the people she transformed into toys to normal. He tries to stand up against her bodyguard Trebol, but gets thoroughly beaten. However, Sugar feeds him the grape she assumed was poisoned to get rid of him (it's actually spiked with an ultra-spicy substance). The result is Usopp screaming in absolute agony while making a <em>spectacular</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">Nightmare Face</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">scary enough to make her scream and faint in turn</a>, rendering her victory moot</span>. Comes up a bit again later when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Usopp weaponizes her newly-gained truama to save Luffy and Law by launching a projection looking like said face to render her unconscious again, all while unlocking Haki.</span>

Even when Poirot deduces that she was the culprit instead of Caroline sixteen years after the murder, he admits that he doesn't have the concrete evidence to get her convicted. However, Elsa still feels like she ultimately lost because not only did Caroline's serene acceptance of her fate deprive her of any satisfaction she might have gained from watching her love rival get punished in her place, but her own life has been empty and devoid of joy after Amyas's death with her being unable to love any other man.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> had MAD searching for a formula to turn lead into gold. They succeed in reproducing the formula, then later on, they drop one of the transmuted gold bars, to discover that what the formula really made was lead-based gold <em>paint</em>.
</li><li> The one time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em> Dick Dastardly actually takes 1st place in a race, the prize he wins has by far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">the lowest monetary worth</a> of any prize in the competition: It's a large quantity of helium balloons, which causes him to helplessly float away into the sky.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> episode "Operation: C.R.I.M.E." had a boy pretend to be able to predict the future so that everyone else in school would be in detention and he'd be first in line at the cafeteria before the good food runs out. He succeeds in his scheme, but finds that today's lunch is a lima bean sandwich rather than the pizza bagels he desired.
<ul><li> Invoked by the heroes in the episode "Operation C.A.K.E.D.T.H.R.E.E. which starts out as Sector V trying to steal the Delightful Children's birthday cake, like normal. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a bunch of chickens that Sector V was going to use</a> end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">doing their business on the cake</a>, at which point Sector V decides to leave. The Delightfuls (who didn't realize what happened) are confused, but go along with their plan of eating their cake on live TV for all the children of the world to watch...only for no child to be jealous or upset, but rather utterly grossed out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: Toffees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">recover his missing finger and restore his full powers, making him nigh-unstoppable,</span> goes off without a hitch... only to be nullified seconds later when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star manages to attain her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>, allowing her to blast him with so much raw power that even his precious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> cant save him.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E17MySisterMySitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E17MySisterMySitter">My Sister, My Sitter</a>", after Lisa is put in charge of babysitting Bart while Homer and Marge are away, Bart decides to ruin Lisa's reputation as a babysitter out of anger, and succeeds in doing so when a prank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Goes Horribly Right</a> and he ends up injured (a dislocated shoulder from falling down the stairs) and unconscious, and she accidentally brings him to the pier where everyone is while trying to get him to the hospital. However, despite her now looking like the worst babysitter ever, Lisa ends up still getting calls for babysitting jobs as she's still the only reliable sitter in town.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>:
<ul><li> While calling her a "villain" might be extreme, the one time Candace finally manages to expose her brothers' antics to their mother Linda and have it stick, it's nullified by the fact she reveals it to the version of their mother twenty years in the future (during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> adventure), at which point things like holograms, flying cars, and jetpacks are commonplace, the future Phineas and Ferb are by then independent adults, and present day Phineas and Ferb aren't technically her jurisdiction anymore, so there's not much Linda can do to punish them. Candace at least finds a little solace in being vindicated and in the fact it's even possible for her to win.
</li><li> Dr. Doofenshmirtz has a victory like this during the episode, "Brain Drain". He is trying to steal the key to the city as he believes that it works like a master key for the city and can open any door. Towards the climax of the episode, he does succeed in getting it, but realizes that it's meant to be an award and can't open anything. And then he gets struck by lightning.
</li><li> Another Doofenshmirtz example occurs in the episode, "Magic Carpet Ride", when he tries to take petty revenge on his brother Roger (who, years ago, accidentally ruined a masterpiece painting Heinz poured his heart and soul into), by ruining a painting Roger is about to unveil to get even. Dr. Doof actually succeeds in preventing Perry from stopping him ruining the painting, but too late does Heinz find out that the painting being unveiled was <em>his</em> painting Roger had been fixing since then. Doofenshmirtz is so depressed by his "win" that he doesn't even flinch as Perry sends him and his hovercraft crashing into the street.
</li><li> Yet <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">another</a></em> Doofenshmirtz example in "Happy New Year", when he creates an "-inator" which changes everyone's New Year's resolutions into helping him take over the Tri-State area as his minions. It worked as intended but Doof <em>didn't</em> anticipate the fact <em>no one keeps their New Year's resolution</em>. In fact, Perry predicted this exact outcome and didn't stop Doof from enacting his plan because he knew it would fail.
