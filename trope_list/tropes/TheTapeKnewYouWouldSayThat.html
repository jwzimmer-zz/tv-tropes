</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> Urahara gives Ichigo a message that splatters onto his bedroom wall that tells the message as it flows down the wall. Ichigo proceeds to comment that it's " LIKE SOME TV CRIME SCENE MESSAGE WRITTEN IN THE VICTIM'S OWN BLOOD!﻿" Then the message continues with a P.S.
<div class="indent"><strong>Urahara voiceover of the message:</strong> P.S. If you think this is some "written in the victims own blood" cliche from some t.v. show, then you obviously have no sense of humor.﻿
</div></li><li> Several times, Lelouch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> uses a recording that he pretends is a live feed to obfuscate his true whereabouts:
<ul><li> In season 1 Stage 3, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">geassed</a> his maid to call the phone in the bathroom and play a simple recorded message from Zero to Kallen in the shower while Lelouch is nearby. Kallen doesn't suspect a thing, securing Lelouch's secret from her.
</li><li> Downplayed in season 1 Stage 15, where he fakes a video conference with Mao, to get Mao to think he was far away so he wouldn't hear Lelouch's thoughts as he approached. Lelouch interrupted Mao a lot and generally ignored his answers, simply pushing his line. He also remained silent for too long, causing Mao to ask, "Cat got your tongue?" before he resumed the pre-recorded message. This worked in large part because Mao was too out-of-his-mind to notice anything off.
</li><li> In the end of R2, he pulls the same trick on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Schneizel</span>, who is a much harder opponent to fool. He even notices Lelouch's tactic briefly, saying "Lelouch, now you're talking in circles..." but doesn't catch on in time to prevent Lelouch from sneaking up behind him. In the original Japanese, this trope is pushed to the limit, as Lelouch predicts <em>exactly</em> what the other party will say and at one point manages to interrupt him at <em>exactly</em> the right time. Even given the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Schneizel is Lelouch's brother, who he knows quite well, whereas Mao was a total stranger</span> this was quite an accomplishment. The dub makes Lelouch's side of the conversation more vague, so he doesn't seem so eerily prescient.
</li></ul></li><li> Less "say" and more "do", but one episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a> the titular robot leaves a message for Noby when he returns from school. Not only did Doraemon predict Noby would be lazing about, he also predicted he would be trying to find him so he states that he's not actually here.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Governor General's</a> tape in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> gives a nice pause while Ala Alba discuss whether to go or not, and then says that he knows Negi plans to decline... Wouldn't it be a shame if he flexed his legal right and sent a fleet of battleships after him and all his students, including the muggles? After all, all he wants to do is to have a nice chat!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MythicalDetectiveLokiRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MythicalDetectiveLokiRagnarok">Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok</a></em>: After Loki is kidnapped, he sends a message to Yamino and Mayura via recorded message in a doll. After his greeting, Mayura shouts about the mystery, to which said doll responds "Let me start off by saying that this is a recording and NOT a mystery for Mayura to get worked up over." She's not that hard to figure out...
</li><li> Occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">Xxx Holic</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lENhiolLrR8">as a letter which correctly predicted Watanuki's reaction four times in a row<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It helps that it was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient">Yuko</a>.
</li><li> Used by Pegasus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the tape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">being cursed</a> and actually allowing two-way communication, though the initial idea on why Pegasus can figure out Yugi's moves so easily has to do with Pegasus having added subliminal images for split-seconds in the recording, forcing Yugi to subconsciously play the card wanted. Both theories seem to be taken for granted, as Pegasus is surprised when Yugi plays the Black Magician instead of the skeleton card he had in his hand.
<ul><li> A flashback in the anime showed how Pegasus humiliated champion duelist Bandit Keith by getting a young boy in the audience to sub in for him, giving him a set of pre-written instructions he was carrying in his jacket. The kid won the match, and the instructions were revealed to accurately predict every move Keith was going to make, and told the kid exactly what to do to win.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump">Doctor Slump</a></em>, where the playing of a recording by Senbei's father to his son turns into a full-blown conversation between them. Senbei's father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even reacts live to his son hugging the TV on which the message was being played</a>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>: Kogoro has made tapes of himself being "busy" someplace while he was really someplace else. Eri's seen through it, so he decides to attempt mixing a new one... while she's calling him on advice for a case. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
<ul><li> Conan also does this briefly, one of the times Ran suspects that he's actually Shinichi - he's on the phone with Ran as Shinichi, records himself saying something, then runs to where she is as Conan and asks for something, before running to finish the conversation as Shinichi.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>, Najimi leaves behind a pre-recorded hologram for Kumagawa; when he tries to peep up its skirt he gets kicked in the face. It helps that Najimi is nigh-omniscient and knows Kumagawa fairly well.
<div class="indent"><em>"I can't see you but I can more or less predict your actions, so I'll just throw a kick here for good measure. If it connects, hooray for me."</em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WorldConquestZvezdaPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WorldConquestZvezdaPlot">World Conquest Zvezda Plot</a></em>, the film reel of "Madame M" projected by the Treasure Club seems to respond to the students in the room, including singling out Asuta when he acts less than enthusiastic.
</li><li> Seemingly played straight in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em> when Lain interrogates an e-mail from a dead classmate who claims to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">left the physical world</a> for an existence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">entirely within the wired.</a> Gradually becomes less straight over the course of the series as we learn that there is a possibility that Chisa really did emigrate to the wired and Lain is far more than the awkward middle school girl she appears to be.
</li><li> In one episode of the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em>, Shin woke up from a nap and found a note from his mother ("I'm out shopping, please clean up and look after the house"). He ignored it and decided to go out to play, and found a note taped on the door ("You know what will happen if you go out and play instead?", complete with an image of his mom wielding a hammer). Incensed, Shin ripped off the note and found <em>another</em> note taped right behind the note he just ripped ("Don't rip this off! You know what will happen if you disobey me?!").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> has a downplayed example when Midoriya gets his U.A. entrance test results, in the form of a recorded projection from All Might. All Might never directly responds to Midoriya, but he does pause at exactly the right times for Midoriya to respond before beginning to talk again.

</li><li> In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomSmith">Tom Smith</a>'s "Psychic Voicemail Hotline", the phone tree knows what choices the caller will make, and when the caller doesn't have money to stay online it offers to tell them the number for the credit card they just got approved which hasn't arrived yet in the mail.

Nightwing assembles a back-up League as per Batman's instructions. When the new team is brought together, they watch a video Batman made for them. Green Arrow starts ranting at some point, to which video Batman yells, "QUEEN, ZIP IT!" Because he's BATMAN.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlakeAndMortimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlakeAndMortimer">Blake and Mortimer</a></em> story <em>The Time Trap</em>, Mortimer finds the time machine along with a recorded message from Miloch, which seems at times to know what Mortimer is doing or saying (not always, however, but enough to unnerve Mortimer). This being a time travel story, Miloch may have been spying Mortimer in advance to record his message, though.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteamWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteamWars">Steam Wars</a></em>, where Bo, as a Quantum Dragoon, uses his powers to actually hold the conversation with General Teft and another Rebel leader. Teft comments that the second half of the recording, which he had viewed earlier, confused him, that is, until the incredulous other captain helpfully supplies the other side of the conversation, that is.
</li><li> Toni Chu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Chew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Chew">Chew</a></em> has limited precognition, with the ability to see a person's future by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eating their flesh</a>. When she learns of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her upcoming death</span> while biting into her partner's shoulder, she essentially pre-records messages for her brother Tony by acting them out by herself, so that when Tony (who has the related ability to see a person's past) reads her memories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">eating her severed toe</a>, he can see Toni effectively talking to him. Toni's memories are able to respond to Tony's questions and comments with uncanny accuracy which is largely played for laughs, but can be chalked up to a combination of her precognition (having bitten her brother several times previously) and knowing her own brother well enough to predict his responses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nemesis">Nemesis</a></em> takes this to absolutely ludicrous degrees at the end of the comic, albeit in letter format instead of recorded videos, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main protagonist receives a letter from a mysterious individual congratulating him for defeating the titular supervillain, revealing that he is from a group of rich and bored indiviuals who get their kicks off by becoming murderous psychopaths.</span> The kicker?

</li><li> Invoked in one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters International</a></em> when we see Egon making an audio recording of his research regarding part of what the others are dealing with overseas.
<div class="indent"><strong>Egon:</strong> I believe someone has found... ...<em>The Rauoskinna</em>. At this point of the recording, Venkman will likely make a <strong>comment</strong> about the book's name or pronunciation, with an outside possibility he's referenced the Norwegian flight attendant who punched him out in grad school.

Subverted when Luthor infiltrates the Fortress of Solitude and selects the data crystal with information about General Zod.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lara:</strong> I had hoped that you would not have to ask me this question. <br/><strong>Luthor:</strong> What's she talking about? I didn't ask her anything.

<ul><li> Ferris prepares one to answer the intercom if anyone rings the doorbell at his house. The responses are keyed to the intercom, so he gets around the awkward pauses, and his responses are vague enough to work for nearly any response. The plan falls through when the principal keeps ringing the doorbell, cycling back to the first message and betraying the ruse.
</li><li> Earlier in the movie after a bedridden Cameron gets off the phone with Ferris:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cameron:</strong> I'm dying. <br/>(<em>phone rings</em>) <br/><strong>Ferris:</strong> You're not dying, you just can't think of anything good to do.
</div></li></ul></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IRobot">I, Robot</a></em> inverts this. Dr. Lanning leaves an interactive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoWills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoWills">hologram</a> at the scene of his death, which is only programmed to respond to a few specific questions, and so Spooner has to figure out just <em>what</em> exactly the tape "knew" he would ask. We later find out that this is because he was being watched by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">VIKI</span> while he was making the hologram, so he had to be very careful about what he said.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dr. Lanning:</strong> I'm sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right questions.
</div></li><li> A very early example (possibly <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">earliest example</a>) is in the 1932 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreeksHadAWordForThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreeksHadAWordForThem">The Greeks Had a Word for Them</a></em> in which a deceased character leaves a will recorded on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoWill">phonograph record</a>. When one of the listeners complains about being explicitly left nothing in the will the recording blandly states "I knew you'd say that."
</li><li> This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagle">Iron Eagle</a></em>. Chappy Sinclair is the wingman for Doug Masters in a plan to use two Air Force jets to rescue Doug's father. Just in case something happens, Chappy makes a tape recording of advice the night before so his voice can continue to guide Doug. Somehow, Chappy manages to predict exactly when he was shot down and doesn't bother to give advice about anything up to that point. The strangest part is when the tape says something like, "You did a good job shooting at the refinery. Now that that's out of the way..."
<ul><li> Doug is shown to be starting and stopping the tape, so it's likely that if he hadn't taken out the refinery, he wouldn't have been in a position to start the tape again from Chappy's perspective.

<div class="indent"><strong>Rupert:</strong> One more thing. You can't tell anybody why you have to spend the money. <br/><strong>Monty:</strong> Why not? <br/><strong>Rupert:</strong> Because I don't want anybody helping you!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em>: Harry uses this on his wife (who is in the room with him) to disguise his voice. "Now dance for me." When she starts hand-jiving, "No, dance sexy." A moment later, the tape clearly <em>doesn't</em> know what she's going to say. Harry has to fast-forward past a bit of the tape where the speaker thought she'd be wearing nylons, and then he has to rewind it to repeat a request when she protests.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tapeheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tapeheads">Tapeheads</a></em>, the main characters' office space is protected by a video of a security guard firing at anyone who trips the system, as shown when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Norman Mart's</a> men bust in, and they fire back, not realizing it's only a video. The video guard even scoffs at them when they run out of bullets, and puts down his gun and salutes just as the main characters (who had been out) walk in. A couple of scenes later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">a limbo band shows up</a>, and the guard on tape is seen dancing along to the music.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the movie, who was thought to be dead, sends a tape to the government agency with the typical threat of blowing something up with a stolen warhead. When we first see the scene you aren't really sure it's just a recording, as it seems to be responding perfectly to the men watching. But used later as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> when Nielsen's character is watching the tape in his house and it runs in the background including all the pauses.

One scene that perfectly sums this up is when his nephew gets a check and walks out with it, only to find that he can't cash it in and comes crawling back to Red Stevens, who knew that he'd do something like that.

Protagonist Joe Chip's TV suddenly switches on to show his boss, Glen Runciter, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has apparently died in an explosion a few weeks before</span>. At first, the two engage in a perfectly coherent, real-time conversation ("<em>You know I'm here. Does that mean you can hear and see me?</em>" "<em>Of course, I can't hear you and see you. This commercial message is on videotape</em>"). However, towards the end of the conversation, Runciter's answers lose meaning and become detached and inappropriate until the TV switches itself off, leaving Joe to ponder:
<div class="indent"><em>Had Runciter been able to hear him? Had Runciter only pretended to be on videotape? For a time, during the commercial, Runciter had seemed to respond to his questions; only at the end had Runciter's words become malappropriate.</em>

The heroes can't make sense of it the first time they watch it, but when they replay it later on, the man's girlfriend is present, and she ends up (reluctantly at first) holding a full conversation with the recording. And then the recording asks the heroes to leave the room so that he can have a private conversation with his girlfriend.

The trope is played straight when one character stands up in sudden anger ("Sit down, Grace Windsor Wexler!") Later, however, the trope is subverted as the deceased millionaire has a message that informs the characters that they're all wrong in their deductions. The reason is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mr. Westing actually isn't dead and is disguised as one of the main characters, which enables him to keep track of other characters' progress in his "game."</span>

</li><li> Done in the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> book, so the main character can have the first stimulating conversation he's had in the book.

The recording then says that there will be people who think this is a fake, a trick.
</li><li> In the "Etiquette" section of <em>Nanny Ogg's Cookbook</em>, she recommends that writers of love letters incorporate the following into their missives, the better to pull this trope on their nosy future children:

When one character's estranged brother sends a diplomatic envoy to speak to him, the diplomat has a series of papers, with the brother's anticipated responses to everything the character says. The diplomat is finally caught off guard when there was no pre-planned response to the man actually saying "Thank You."
</li><li> A more overtly magical version in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeedfulThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeedfulThings">Needful Things</a></em>.

<ul><li> Agnes Nutter leaves a box containing the second volume of her Nice and Accurate Prophecies in the care of several lawyers successively to be delivered to her descendant Anathema at the right time. The ones who are tempted to open the box to find out what's inside inevitably find an envelope with their name on it, containing a letter decrying them for not following her instructions and naming something horribly embarrassing or compromising about their life that will be revealed if they don't close the box right now.
</li><li> Also in <em>Good Omens</em>, the order of the prophecies themselves turns out to be significant. For ease of reference, the Device family transcribes the original book onto a bunch of file cards. Anathema loses her copy of the Book (accidentally leaving it in Crowley's Bentley, to be found by Aziraphale), and has only the file cards to go with. During the bumpy ride to the place where Armageddon is happening (but not the <em>proper</em> riding forth of Armageddon), she drops the box and gets the cards all jumbled up. When she laments this, Newt counters that if Agnes was so good, whatever card Anathema grabs will be the one most relevant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whether or not he's serious, he's right. The jumbled order of the prophecies, which had baffled the family for centuries, was apparently just so Anathema could pull the right ones out when she needed them right then.</span>

Angleton, while very good, ends up underestimating the time it will take for Bob to complete it, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisPageWillSelfDestruct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisPageWillSelfDestruct">the tape self-destructs</a> before Bob is fully briefed.
</li><li> One of the <em>Journeys to Fayrah</em> books makes use of this trope. The main characters go digging in a forgotten trunk in the attic and discover an audio tape recorded by one of their friends from Biq, the land of computers. The awesome supercomputing power available in Biq allows simulations so extensive that they can predict the future to an arbitrary level of detail; thus, the tape is perfectly tailored so that the main characters can have a natural conversation with it.
</li><li> Stanislaw Lem's <em>Golem XIV</em> does this. Although his lectures and seminars appear to happen in real time, actually he thinks a million times faster than the audience and can pre-generate a half-hour discourse in an eyeblink. And since he is able to model people's responses with uncanny accuracy, this works with dialogues just as well as with monologue. The editor of the sessions explicitly remarks how frustrated this makes unprepared listeners feel.
</li><li> In an example that more closely resembles "The Map Knew You Would Do That", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em> has the Marauder's Map deny Snape access to its contents when he tries to view it, except for a series of four messages from the students that created it (according to Pottermore, the Marauders purposely enchanted the map "to forever repel (as insultingly as possible) the curiosity of their nemesis, Severus Snape", to prevent him from being able to use the map if he ever found it):
<div class="indent">"Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business." <br/>"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git." <br/>"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor." <br/>"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball."

</li><li> In <em>Be A Perfect Person in Just Three Days!</em> by Stephen Manes, the main character takes a peek at the last page of the eponymous self-help book he finds in the school library... and finds only a paragraph scolding him for trying to peek at the end.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HilaryTamar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HilaryTamar">Thus Was Adonis Murdered</a></em> by Sarah Caudwell, Selena is reading aloud a letter Julia wrote her about Julia's vacation in Venice. Julia writes that "they have taken my passport," and Selena comments, "They can't do that to Julia. She is a British subject." The letter continues:
<div class="indent">And it's no use your saying, Selena, that I am a British subject and they can't do that to me. They have done.

David displayed an array of cards onscreen, and told the viewers to, starting with the center card, count off three cards in any direction. Then he'd say "I sense that you did not land on Card #2, so I'll remove that one." This was a classic magician's "force": no matter which three cards you chose, it was mathematically impossible to land on Card #2. This continued until there was one card left — "chosen" simultaneously by millions of viewers.

After Geoff steals the videos from Graham, he leaves a pre-recorded ransom note on the computer.

This confuses the crew, since it's in response to nothing. However, then the ransom video starts the loop over again. It plays through this trope pretty much exactly, and when it gets to the end again, this time having a "conversation" with the crew, Graham says, "OK, that time works."

<ul><li> Automated active telemarketing systems take advantage of this. A call is made, and if a certain pattern of silence/sound/silence is detected (that would be a person saying "Hello" or their name and waiting for a reply), the system assumes there's a real person on the line, and the call is automatically switched to a live operator.
<ul><li> They're taking it a stage further. The caller at the other end, a recording, stammers a little then says "oh, a little trouble with my headphones!" as if it were a live call before any other contact is made. And unless one simply tells a live person at the other end to bug off or blocks the call with apps like Hiya, they'll call again with the same recorded spiel.
</li><li> This technique was made fun of in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenSword">Broken Sword</a></em> games, when you can listen to messages left on the answering machine. One of them is an automated telemarketer calling about soffits. Part of the call is "When was the last time you had your soffits checked? (Long pause). Hmmm, I thought so.".
</li></ul></li><li> Social Engineers and other scambusters have turned this trope into a real weapon against telemarketers and phone scammers. AI with various pre-recorded routines are set to answer a phone and emulate an older person whose mind is slightly wandering. The AI pauses, stammers, constantly asks the scammer to repeat questions and directions, and wanders into off-topic stories about their adult children "who recommended your service last week". In short, the AI is playing the perfect mark for the scam, while frustrating them with endless responses that keep the scammer fruitlessly hanging on the line and not scamming anyone else. The resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> recordings of such calls are things of beauty to listen to.
</li><li> A thought experiment about doing this in a book form is called <em>Einstein's Mind</em>. If you could set up a book so that it would have all of the correct responses for any query, would the book be sentient or not?
