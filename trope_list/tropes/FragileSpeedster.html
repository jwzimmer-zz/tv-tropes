After all, it's hard to keep up that kind of speed when your armor is weighing you down. As a result, the Fragile Speedster is often forced to rely on dodging abilities to avoid getting struck in the first place, and if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">do take a hit, down they go</a>.
</p><p>A Fragile Speedster often relies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a> to gain an advantage over slower foes. They tend to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedBlitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedBlitz">quick attack speed</a> (and thus possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">high</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">attack rate</a>). If the character makes up for a lack of durability by using speed as a way of evading attacks, they may even function similarly to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> via a tactic referred to as being a "Blink Tank".
</p><p>Though exaggerated in fiction, this trope has some basis in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Armor is heavy.

However, they just as often dominate the tier lists — having poor defense doesn't mean diddly-squat if you never get hit. Racing games often have a variant where the lighter vehicles have high acceleration and turning, but have a less powerful engine, lower top speed, and are also generally much easier for other racers to knock off the track in collisions due to their low mass.

</li><li> After acquiring the wind cloak and sword from Flora, Serpico can run, jump, and even fly, but he has very little defense against physical attacks- when a troll hits him in the side with a spiked mace, he's down for at least two days.
</li><li> Isidro, being a child, is a fragile speedster by default. He wants to be as strong and tough as Guts, but Guts advises him to use his speed and small size to his advantage instead, advice which Isidro grudgingly takes. While still not the most competent fighter ever, Isidro is still alive after numerous battles with demonic monsters, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">in this series</a> is a feat in and of itself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Casca gets her sanity back she actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype">trains</a> Isidro herself whose delighted to find someone whose fighting style is akin to his own.</span>

They are also the fastest, at least until Takuya and Koji reach other evolutionary levels.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sena was very fast before the series began to avoid getting beat up by bigger kids. Hiruma recruits him to become the runningback for the football team, promising that if he was fast enough, he wouldn't get tackled. Later in the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Sena toughens up defensively, enough to shake off linebackers trying to tackle him.</a>
</li><li> Panther is not as fragile as Sena, but he can be taken down relatively easily... provided you can even come close to touching him.
</li><li> Of Teikoku Taka and Karin. Taka could freaking fly and, presumably, finish the 40-yard dash in less than 5 seconds, but when compared to Yamato, he seemed to be (relatively) frail. Karin is a fragile girl with good quaterback ability, but she couldn't take a hit.

</li></ul><ul><li> The High Elf Archer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em> uses speed and agility to keep her from dangers, while she decimates her opponents with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">a bow and arrow</a>. But even a single goblin can knock her to the ground.

It even manages to demolish the Alex's resilient Chobham Armor. Unfortunately, it buys this speed and firepower at a high price—no armor of its own to speak of. It is torn to pieces by a single burst from the Alex's 90mm Gatling cannon.
</li><li> The Correl, a mobile suit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> example of the trope. It's so delicate that it can't use any weapons other than a beam knife, but it's so fast that it can inflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> on most enemy mobile suits it fights, and it nearly totals Garrod's Gundam.

By stripping the armor from the suit and installing progressively larger engines, Graham was able to increase his Flag's performance to the point where it was a match for the Gundams in terms of speed and maneuverability, if not armor (not that armor really mattered, as even heavily-armored suits get shredded by Gundams). The GN Flag was the logical conclusion of this process having <em>no</em> armor, one beam sword as a weapon, and a freaking <em>Gundam</em> engine rammed into the back. Yes, Graham stuck a Gundam engine into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a> suit. Needless to say the result practically has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, at the cost of absolutely no defense.
</li><li> This really applies to many of the Mook MS, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIGLOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIGLOO">MS IGLOO</a></em>. Despite being 60-ton armored giants, Zaku are actually pretty vulnerable to attack by missile-equipped infantry and tanks due to poor situational awareness (like what tank crews have to deal with in real life, also being an 18 meter tall robot just makes you easier to hit). Due to this, the survival of most Mobile Suits seems to hinge around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet">dodging cannon fire and missiles</a> despite them being gigantic robots that dwarf all the weapon systems shooting at them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamThunderbolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamThunderbolt">Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt</a></em>: The MS-06R Psycho Zaku from the first arc is an exceptionally fast and well armed machine with a ton of verniers to easily dodge attacks and the space debris that litters the sector it operates in. While it does have more armor than the average Zaku, the Federation's heavy ordinance and beam weaponry make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">that a moot point</a>. This contrasts it with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> FA-78 Full Armor Gundam; the Psycho Zaku evades attacks while the Gundam's heavier armor and extra shields allows him to tank more punishment than the Zaku. This comes to a head in the end where both heavily damaged suits launch one last mutual attck; the Gundam loses its head and arm but remains intact while the Zaku loses its head, all of its limbs, and explodes soon after.
</li><li> The Earth Forces' Windams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a>. They're fragile and blow up with alarming frequency, but are armed with beam rifles (thus all but guaranteeing one-hit KO's), and can fly, giving them a massive advantage over ZAFT's slower, earthbound ZAKU's.
</li><li> Astray from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Gundam SEED</a></em> and their successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Murasame</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> is even more fragile speedster than their Alliance counterpart, Daggers and Windams. Notably, Murasame is even more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> than any other grunt mech in this verse and could go toe to toe with Gundams since they pack immense firepower for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>. There's a reason their armor is called Foaming Metal though...
</li><li> The Eternal is a ship variant. It's the fastest spaceship in the series and can outrun every other type of ship. However it can't even take on a single Zaft mook ship by itself and win, as opposed to Archangel and its many weapons. Instead it's reliant on its mobile suits to protect it, and it's specifically designed to support and deploy the Freedom and the Justice, two of the most powerful mobile suits in the series.
</li><li> Most of the Mobile Suits from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> trade on not getting hit instead of tanking shots, due to the growing prevalence of beam weapons in the storyline. The epitome of this is probably the Hyaku Shiki, Quattro's distinctive gold mobile suit. Incredibly high speed, good firepower, but very easily damaged due to the fact that it weapons layout omits a shield. While the gold skin is actually a coating meant to protect against beam weapons, in practice it proved ineffective and thus the Hyaku Shiki is only barely more resistant to them than any other machine while also lacking a shield to block projectile and explosive weapons.
</li><li> Chronologically later Universal Century stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91">Mobile Suit Gundam F91</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> continue this trend, making nearly all mobile suits physically smaller and lighter with even less armor than before. This allows them to be faster and more agile, but also means that even human-sized bazookas could cause actual damage if they score a hit. Yet also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">zig-zagged</a> in that the introduction of beam shields mean that mobile suits finally have a capacity to block beam cannon shots (previously only mobile armors enormous enough to have room for an I-Field generator could do this), so long as they can position their shield properly.
</li><li> The EMS-10 Zudah of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo">Mobile Suit Gundam MS Igloo</a></em> is another example of a Zeon design <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">focusing too much on one trait</a>. Originally a production competitor to the Zaku I, the Zudah features reasonable firepower but far less armor—it is noticeably less hefty than the standard Zaku I and has less armor coverage overall as well. It was also <em>exceptionally</em> fast as a result, but had the unnerving tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">disintegrate completely if their engines were pushed to the limit such that the sheer thrust tore apart the frame</a>. As such they were much, much faster than even the Zaku II, but so fragile that <em>their own engines</em> could kill them. Of the four Zudahs seen, two overtaxed their engines and exploded, taking their skilled pilots with them. A 50% loss rate with no enemy hits scored consigned the Zudah to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> junkheap of history.

</li><li> Micaiah from <em>ViVid</em> has a Barrier Jacket (or Knight Clothing) called Storm Armor, which is designed to give her immense speed but low defense.

She does also <em>heal</em> faster, as well.
<ul><li> Ironically Wolverine was actually this in his first appearance in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> #180-181; both Hulk and The Wendigo could've smashed the crap out of him if they could land a hit, but Wolverine was simply too agile for both of them (Hulk even calls him "little rabbit"). It's worth mentioning this was before Wolverine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbreakableBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbreakableBones">Adamantium skeleton</a> was established, which made him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> from then on.

It has enough room for an armored Marine and his gun or his shield, but not both, so if they have to bail out for whatever reason, they will be relatively unprotected.

Their high casualty rate is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">considered acceptable</a> by the Empire.

The female, which is flightless, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>. This actually complements their separate fighting styles, allowing the two to work together well enough to gain the advantage against Godzilla: While the male is distracting Godzilla, it allows the much bigger and stronger female to attack Godzilla from behind. When Godzilla reacts to this and begins to overpower the female, the male flies around and attacks Godzilla again from behind, distracting him and repeating the cycle.

</li><li> The overall battle doctrine of the Dornish people, though not to the extent of the Dothraki (who wear no armor at all). A knight would cook inside of heavy steel plate armor in the hot deserts of Dorne, so Dornish tactics opt for lighter leather or copper armor, and rely more on speed and agility. This is a real-life principle about armies fighting in arid regions: Saladin's armies in the Crusades similarly had lighter armor and similarly had to rely more on speed and agility.

<ul><li> Eldar are fast and fragile, but more specialized than weak, their unit are extremely effective in the right place.

</li><li> Eldar Harlequins are also masters of fragile speedster combat, relying heavily on speed, agility, and stealth to compensate for their almost complete lack of armor.
</li><li> The Tau tend to rely heavily on mobility to cover their frailness in close combat, though their primary emphasis is on picking their enemies apart with superior firepower.
</li><li> Tyranid Genestealers combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>. They can cover a tremendous distance per turn and have excellent initiative and weapon skill stats, comparable to a lot of the Eldar and Dark Eldar's close combat specialists. Once they get in melee, they can deliver a massive amount of rending high-strength attacks that kill enemy units extremely quickly. Of course, their poor armor save means that they can be easily shot to pieces, and their high points cost ensure that any player must be careful with them.
</li><li> Ork Warbuggies and Trukks are among the game's flimsiest vehicles, but they make up for it in speed, while also packing a decent punch for their size and being mercifully cheap.
</li><li> The Raider ship class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em> is this with a pinch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>. The fastest and most maneuverable ship class by a fairly significant amount, it also packs a decent amount of forward-facing firepower and an excellent turning radius compared to heavier ship classes. However, Raider-class ships have only average armor and the smallest health pools of any ship in the game, so if they're getting targeted by a larger ship's main guns, they're kind of screwed. The Raider class's biggest advantage in terms of being a Fragile Speedster is that the number of ships that can fire behind themselves without using bomber craft is <em>tiny</em> — there's a grand total of <em>one</em> among the enormous list of standard Imperial hull types, and it's a speedy transport that thinks it's half-Raider — and between their speed and maneuverability, Raiders have a relatively easy time staying in that back arc (and can actually outrun pretty much any non-Eldar bomber craft if they really need to).

Several entire classes of non-BattleMech units also qualify for the role: Hovercraft are pretty much the fastest type of land unit, but highly prone to finding themselves abruptly grounded and vulnerable to being pounded to pieces in short order, VTOLs are light and fast but susceptible to losing their rotor and crashing, and conventional fighters, while being really <em>extremely</em> fast relative to anything that usually operates on a ground map, suffer from both poor armor and the aerospace critical hit rules (short version, pretty much <em>anything</em> that hits such a fighter may go critical). In fact, during ground support missions any kind of fighter, including the more solid aerospace versions, qualifies because taking any damage whatsoever forces them to make a 'control roll' to avoid abruptly losing altitude and potentially imitating a lawn dart; this together with their capacity to carry quite a bit of firepower <em>plus</em> an external bomb load actually pushes the larger models into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> territory.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a>: Skinks. They're among the fastest infantry in the game, with a move score of 6 and initiative 4... but their toughness score is so low even elves consider them fragile. Ranked-up units tend to be used for flanking enemies, while the skirmishers tend to run around picking off war machines and chariots in a hail of poisonous blowdarts.
</li><li> Elves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingsOfWar">Kings of War</a></em> have a move of 6, 50% higher than dwarf infantry, but rarely have a Defense better than 4+, meaning that any hit will hurt them half the time.
</li><li> TIE Fighters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/XWingMiniatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/XWingMiniatures">X-Wing Miniatures</a></em> aren't very manoeuvrable, have only three hull points each, and lack shields. However, they are capable of blistering speeds and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">they're cheap</a> - you can buy two Academy Pilots for the price of the most basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">T-70 X-wing</a>. Interceptors are even faster thanks to the Boost action, and are much more agile with a ridiculous amount of green on the dial, but are no more durable than a basic TIE Fighter. On the Rebel side, A-Wings are absurdly fast, having a green 5 move (most ships have that as either white or red, and many don't have it at all), but only 2 hull and shield. Scum, meanwhile, have the knife-fighting Protectorate Starfighter, which is basically a 4-hull TIE Interceptor that come with a handful of upgrades dedicated solely to point blank knife-fighting. On a tactical level, this is the idea of Arc-Dodger lists, which tend to be small, elite and fragile, but counter straightforward jousting lists by never being in their fire arcs to begin with; they fall apart against turret lists, which don't <em>care</em> about fire arcs.
</li><li> Kanga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheOthers">The Others</a></em> can move 5 spaces per turn, greatly outspeeding her teammates.

Pair it up with a sufficiently fast motor such as the Hyper Dash or Plasma Dash and you've better prepare to shell out money on a spare chassis. FRP plates which serve as both reinforcement and a platform to attach optional accessories such as rollers and brakes amongst other things have been made to mitigate these shortcomings, however, though Tamiya has since released chassis like the FM-A and AR that are beefier and able to take a beating better than previous-generation platforms.

Linn Kurosawa. In this game she is frail, has weak power, and is a sitting duck when reloading her pistol (the other characters can move while their guns cool down), but compensates by having the highest speed and has the largest move set out of the four characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleCircuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleCircuit">Battle Circuit</a></em> has Yellow Iris categorized as a Speedy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XenozoicTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XenozoicTales">Cadillacs and Dinosaurs</a></em>: Hannah, the party's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>, is the fastest with knives, and has the best dash, yet she can't take that many hits.
</li><li> Guy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em>. Lacking the powerhouse strength of Haggar, nor the average power of Cody, Guy is the fastest. He can't take too many hits as even a simple mook can wittle his health bar easily to nothing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfDragons">The King of Dragons</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Elf</a>. Given the range of his arrows, vastly superior to other characters' attacks, he is in fact one of the easier character to win the game with. He cannot take that many hits though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheRound">Knights of the Round</a></em>: Lancelot. Even when he is fully leveled up, the knight still has the lowest health out of the trio, yet is still speedier than everyone else.

Fast grabs, quick down attacks, and fast desperation attacks. With Ryno being the smallest of the four, his frame is the most sensitive to enemy attacks.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a></em> series, Blaze is this in the first game only. Her health and attack strength were weak, but she moves quicker than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Adam</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Axel</a>, and she could throw enemies further than either of the two. Skate became the speedster in <em>2</em> &amp; <em>3</em>. Similar to Blaze, he has fast speed and attacks, but has weak strength and stamina. And unique to the second game, he is the only one who could run across the screen. In the third game, everyone had a dash, but Skate's was still the quickest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersDevastation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersDevastation">Transformers: Devastation</a></em> has two of them, Bumblebee and Sideswipe. Bumblebee is the most agile of the characters, having a combo reset as his special ability, but is relatively frail. Sideswipe totes high speed to compensate for his low defense stat, yet he's still stronger than Bumblebee and faster than Optimus, Wheejack, and Grimlock. In addition, Sidewipe has a unique skill that allows him to reach his target almost instantly, where his close combat skills can do their work.
</li><li> Kyle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViolentStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViolentStorm">Violent Storm</a></em>. His defense is low and his attacks are very weak, but he has lighting quick attacks, fast grabs, and can dash the fastest out of the trio.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UndercoverCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UndercoverCops">Undercover Cops</a></em>: Rosa Felmond.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedArmorGainSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedArmorGainSpeed">Zero Suit Samus</a> is very agile, especially in the <em>Wii U/3DS</em> game which gave her great recovery, but she's very light.
</li><li> Sonic is the fastest character in all the games he appears in, but making full use of that speed is the only way to win with him. Even after <em>Wii U/3DS</em> improved his KO power, most of his strongest attacks are rather slow, and he can be KOed at very low percentages, which necessitates a hit-and-run strategy.
</li><li> Meta Knight, despite being known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in <em>Brawl</em>, is this. He's very fast in both movement and attack and his multiple jumps and special attacks give him some good edgeguarding ability, decent recovery, and good KO moves. However, he's also a lightweight and able to be KOed or knocked into an irrecoverable position easily, not to mention that most of his attacks are meant to rack up damage with multiple weak hits.

The I-gear (or <em>The Fighter</em>) have powerful Jet-series engines that let them have extremely fast boosted top speeds; unfortunately, much of this speed comes at the price of precious armor and shields. Special mention must also be made of their unique skill Overbooster, which makes them shoot forth at 600m/s for a few seconds, faster than any other gear. Also, their agility can be built to be so high that with the right buffs, their evade is well over 100%, and almost nothing that is a missile can hit them.

They can keep up with Ezio doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> - normal guards can freerun too but can't keep up - but aren't that resilient or powerful. Even early-game normal guards can do a number on thieves if you don't help them.

</li><li> Destroyers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacificFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacificFleet">Atlantic Fleet</a></em>. Just like their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> prototypes, they aren't meant to directly engage heavier enemies, lacking any armor to speak of. However, they're also the fastest ships in the game (depending on the class), with some able to go as fast as 36 knots. When facing larger ships, they can either try to run away (ships have to be at least 25,000 yards away from the nearest enemy in order to be able to flee a battle) or try to get close enough to launch broadside torpedoes, while jinking and using smoke to throw off the enemy's aim. Even a near-miss with a large enough caliber can ruin a destroyer's day.
</li><li> The "paper" form of your ball in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ballance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ballance">Ballance</a></em> fits this trope: it is very fast and light (sometimes too much - it can accidentally fly off rails), and can use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VentPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VentPhysics">fans</a> to propel itself upwards, but it cannot push anything out of its way or be used to operate buttons, levers etc.

Compared to the boys, she has much less health but is far faster (though Nightwing may be faster in some areas). She also has limited options in combat (3 tools max), causing her to be much more reliant on dodging.

Scouts are strategically fast units that excel at capturing and threatening villages with their fast movement, but are not as tough or hard-hitting as main-line infantry. The other kind of fragile speedster, the elusive units, rely heavily on their dodging ability to survive in combat. Their low hitpoints and poor resistances make them especially vulnerable to magical attacks and poison, though on the flipside, they can also race back to villages and heal quickly. This category includes the poison-wielding Orcish Assassin, the skirmishing Fencer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Saurian Skirmisher</a>, the life-draining Ghost, the backstabbing Thief, and the simply irritating Footpad.

Interceptor-types within their classes have the least HP and the most mobility while having the least number of weapon mounts, at least until you get to Lines whose Interceptors have the most mounts, even exceeding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Assaults.</a>

They're faster than their competition (consisting of the Soviets and <em>their</em> allies) but have less HP. For instance, the Allied Mirage Tank is fast and reasonably well armed, but has low HP and goes down in a few hits.

The British using the Commando Support doctrine can also call in a Tetrarch, a light tank, which comes crashing in on a glider. It's capable of zipping around the map quickly and it's still more than a match for infantry and light vehicles, but it's very vulnerable to even smaller anti-tank guns, and heavier guns like the Flak 88 will one-shot it. The Russian T-70 in <em>2</em> is similar, being fast with decent firepower, but it's even less armoured than the Tetrarch.

Of the races of Men, they typically have the greatest natural athleticism and a preference for lighter armors which allow them to keep this advantage (and are simply more practical in their desert homeland).

<ul><li> Frigates and especially interceptors use their speed as the primary form of defense against larger ships: larger ships have massive cannons, but the guns are so big they can't track small, fast-moving opponents. Most larger ships will therefore rely on smaller ships to offer "point" defense. That being said, if one of those massive cannons is able to hit a frigate or interceptor, they'll only need one hit.
</li><li> When they were first introduced, Titans played like this despite being the durable ships in the game on paper. The problem was that Titans are so big that it's almost impossible for ships to miss them, and although durable on paper, they could not withstand the combined fire of a fleet for very long. However Titans also couldn't be warp scrambled and could just leave whenever they wanted. Hence Titan Pilots used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">just warp in, deploy their doomsday, and immediately warp out</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve">Evolve</a></em> has the Wraith. It has the lowest health and armor of all the monsters. On the other hand, its warp ability allows it excellent horizontal and vertical mobility. On top of that, its Warp Blast can act as an extra warp in emergencies. These factors, combined with its smaller hitbox, make it excellent at hit and run tactics and horrible at direct fights.
</li><li> Klaus von Lichtenheim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate">Exit Fate</a></em> has the highest speed stat of all playable characters in the game, often making him capable of taking multiple actions before the enemy even gets one. But since he's in fact a cat, he can't equip armor and has very bad defense.

From the same game there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Cazadors</a> who are quite fragile if you've got enough firepower, but they move <em>terrifying fast</em> and their poisonous stinging attacks will be quicker than your bullets, lasers and plasma shots.

However, he has 35 fewer hit points than most of the others, and of course being a dog he can only equip certain dog armors which are statistically inferior to human and super mutant armor. His relatively small hitbox does help him out, though.
</li><li> Rider of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> has poor endurance and no ability to take a hit, but she's incredibly agile and very fast, making her very difficult to hit, and can fight in conditions that other Servants would have problems with, such as while speeding up the side of a skyscraper (as Saber discovers to her dismay).

Whenever the ninja prince is in your party, he's usually the first to get ready to attack. Quite infamously, he's also usually the first one to die.
</li><li> The Thief and Ninja classes usually wear light armor but with high Dexterity or Speed stats. Character examples include Yuffie (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>) and Rikku (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>). In games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, Ninjas gain the Dual Wield ability which increases their damage dramatically, allowing them to double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>.
</li><li> The Cactuar enemy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>. It has only 3 HP, but also some of the highest Evasion in the game. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook">King Mook</a> version (the optional boss Gigantuar), however, is a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, being one of the hardest opponents in the entire game.

They are usually the fastest race and their strength ranges from medium to pretty strong. However, their HP is not so hot so a few strong hits can quickly down a Viera unit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Thief class has low hit points and low defense. However, he can steal valuable items from enemies, and he'll dodge more shots than he'll take.
</li><li> Less robust Myrmidon-class characters can fall into this trope, as well, with the class itself already leaning towards the speed and skill stats over sheer might or defenses.
</li><li> The Pegasus Knight class also falls into this. They also have low hit points and defense, but stand a good chance of dodging most hits because they're light and fast. They often come equipped with Slim weapons, too, which deal little damage but almost always allow a double hit. (However, Pegasus Knights are <em>very</em> strong against magic, and thus make very effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">Mage Killers</a>.)

</li><li> The Red Gazelle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em> definitely qualifies. Incredibly fast, but... you might want to do your best to stay away from anyone who might be feeling aggressive.
<ul><li> Twin Noritta is by far the smallest vehicle in the series at just 780 kg. It accelerates like no one's business, but it can be put down by even a glancing hit. If it ends up in the middle of a pack of other racers, it is in for a world of hurt.

Balancing this, it doesn't take much more than a gust of wind to kill her, contrasting Godzilla who tanks damage and has the all-powerful atomic breath.
</li><li> Ivan and Sheba, both of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>, are very much fragile speedsters, lacking in health but having a high speed. Since that only affects turn order, which doesn't amount to much, they're also blessed with a high amount of Psynergy Points, meaning they can both rain down their spells with impunity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, Thieves are often forced into combat-heavy situations with less-than-adequate defense, and very few defensive skills at their disposal. Instead, they rely on an awful lot of dodge-rolling, turning invisible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Shadow Stepping</a>, crippling their enemy while using speed boosts, and just generally being a pain in the ass. With some builds that emphasize offense in addition to their ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a> for massive damage, they often straddle the line between this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> territory.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> game starts you up with scout fighters that are ridiculously fast, but start popping like balloons as soon as someone directs an anti-fighter weapon in their general direction. <em>Cataclysm</em> starts out like this, but it doesn't take long for the frail fighters to gain the ability to combine into more powerful (and actually useful) corvettes, and near the end of the game they get upgraded to full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> status.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakXCombatRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakXCombatRacing">Jak X Combat Racing</a></em>, about half the available cars are built for speed over durability, but the ones that most exemplify the Fragile Speedster approach to combat racing are the <strike>Mayfly</strike> Firebat and the Havoc <strike>A4</strike> V12. While going really fast in a racing game would usually be a good thing, there are plenty of weapons dotted around the tracks and you can be killed by brushing against a wall, meaning that a high velocity often only serves to put you in front of someone's machine guns.

All four (Disco Bandit, Accordion Thief, Avatar of Sneaky Pete, and Snake Oiler) have Moxie as their dominant stat, meaning they'll almost always go first in initiative and have a much higher dodge rate than their fellow classes. In turn, they suffer in terms of both durability and damage output- low Muscle means they have poor health and damage reduction, and low Mysticality means not a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> to fuel their combat skills.

But he has the smallest health bar, dying in one or two hits without upgrades.
</li><li> The Adept class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty">Majesty</a></em> is extremely quick and has a buff spell to make them even quicker. However, their initial hit points are fairly low (a few steps above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>) and they wear light armor, so while new Adepts might patrol the settlement, don't expect them to win many battles. (In fact, they tend to flee after taking even a tiny amount of damage.)
</li><li> Lightweights in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> can accelerate quickly, and are excellent off-road, but are really easily knocked around by the heavier classes. If the player slows down for even a second (Red/Spiny Shells, anyone?), expect someone from behind to drive into them, sending them careening off a ledge.
</li><li> In multiplayer <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, the Drell Adept and Vanguard fit this role; they are incredibly fast, but they have weaker barriers than any other class.
<ul><li> The M-44 Hammerhead tank skirts the edge between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> - it's fitted with a really powerful gun and is very nimble, but bursts into flames if the bad guys so much as look at it funny.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> series, Light mechs are very agile, accelerate quickly, and offer very small profiles. They also have very little armor and generally weak weapons. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the Solitaire in <em>Mechwarrior Living Legends</em>, a mech with armor so thin that it can lose an arm from bumping into a tree too hard. On the other hand, it's the fastest ground asset in the entire game and carries a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">honking huge gun</a> on its shoulder (or more accurately, <em>is</em> its shoulder). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Battlearmor</a> in <em>Living Legends</em> is actually quite slow and can only survive a couple shots from most weapons, but make up for it by being the most agile asset in the game - it can sprint around, and jump jet in any direction, allowing a good battlearmor player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader">jump onto enemy battlemechs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit">kill the pilot</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Quick Man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em>. He certainly lives up to his name, but happens to be one of the robot masters that takes double damage from the Mega-Buster (for reference, Metal Man, the guy mocked for being weak to it, takes half the damage Quick Man does), and is weak to two separate weapons (the Crash Bombs and Time Stopper) instead of the usual one.
</li><li> Slash Man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7">Mega Man 7</a></em> fits under this trope as well. Small, speedy, two weaknesses (Freeze Cracker and Scorch Wheel/Burning Wheel).
</li><li> Zero in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series attacks a lot faster than X, due to his Z-Saber having superior speed to X's X-Buster, as well as Zero's mobility in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">Double Jump</a>. However, Zero attacks at a much closer range, and is incompatable with X's armor sets. As a result, Zero is much more fragile than X.
</li></ul></li><li> Compared to other games, Samus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> feels like this with the odd recovery system where you need to stand still to charge up to recover at low health. This means that you can't heal most of the time. And she is very fast and can do ninja like dodges. In Hard mode, you are restricted to just 99 health, and so many attacks can OHKO you if you get hit, making her even more fragile. Samus can literally tear through rooms lategame at high speed.
</li><li> Faith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> can't take too much in the way of subautomatic fire. Good thing she can cross a hallway, shimmy up the wall, and scoot down an airvent in the time it takes some of the enemies to turn and get a bead on her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Sword and Shield weapon. The striking power of each hit is not great, the reach is horribly short, and the guard while at least present is nothing to write home about. The weapon does however allow for rapid strikes and running while drawn and with the often powerful elemental damage, the trusty Sword can be deceptively powerful. Subsequent games turned the Sword and Shield into a versatile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>, with buffed per-strike damage and the unique ability to use items while drawn as well. Which brings us to...
</li><li> Dual Swords. Even quicker attacks and a Demon mode to really unleash flurries of blows, but no guard to speak of. This weapon is pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAThousandCuts">Death by a Thousand Cuts</a>.
</li><li> Theropod bird wyverns such as the Yian Kit Ku move very fast and unpredictably, but have thin hides and don't take much to kill.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> games, the Hare and Pixie characters are rated very highly on the speed factor. However, they have low defense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MORDHAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MORDHAU">MORDHAU</a>:</em> Eschewing armor entirely will let you move around very, very fast, even if you don't attack any faster than the rest. The extra footwork you can put in is extremely handy, but you <em>will</em> need it because most of the weapons will kill you in one hit if they catch you unarmored, especially the sharp ones.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">Skaven</a> are this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MordheimCityOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MordheimCityOfTheDamned">Mordheim: City of the Damned</a></em>. Lots of movement points, excellent climbing and jumping skills, and pretty decent in melee due to their high dodge chances. However, they have very low HP, often have to wear light armour or lose their innate mobility advantage, and have low morale to boot - Skaven are cowards and don't react well to heavy casualties. They're not exactly great at range either.
</li><li> Boney and Salsa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>. Both of them are speedy animals (a dog and a monkey, respectively) with okay attack power (lousy attack power in Salsa's case), poor defenses, and low HP.
</li><li> Robots in <em>Mutant League Hockey</em> are faster but less resilient than skeletons or trolls (on teams at or around the same rating, at least). According to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">manual</a>, the all-robot Turbo Techies consist of the sole exception to this rule, GIL-9000, and a bunch of copies based on his blueprints; their frailty is explained by the use of inferior materials in their construction. The <em>other</em> all-robot team, the Bruiser Bots, are even less durable than the Techies, if only slightly. The robot teams tend to suffer a lot of casualties in games against violent or physical teams, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">troll</a>-heavy ones. They also fare poorly in actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HockeyFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HockeyFight">fights</a> because they can't take many hits.
</li><li> <em>Mutant League Football</em>: The only robots are found on the all-robot Turbo Techies. Their receivers aren't sturdy enough to break most tackles and can struggle to get out of coverage, and their star running back is hard to bring down but has low HP. This means that, yes, troll-dominated defenses spell trouble for them. They also don't get many kills except on dirty plays. The Techies' defensive line and secondary are pretty tough, though, and they record a lot of tackles and sacks thanks to their speed.
</li><li> <em>Mutant Football League</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to the above:
<ul><li> The Orcs of Hazzard's offense depends entirely on megastar RB Iron Jaw Macgilicutti. He's blisteringly fast, but he's just one man, and the D will get their hands on him eventually. Repeated runs against a hard-hitting defense can easily put Iron Jaw on the sidelines or in a hearse, eliminating the Orcs as a scoring threat to any half-decent D. Thankfully he can throw and catch the ball too.
</li><li> Shreddy Von Hatin of the Full Metal Mayhem, and demon running backs in general. Shreddy is the fastest and most agile RB in the game, but like all demon players his weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> makes him injury prone and causes him to recover very little damage between plays. When the Mayhem are played by the AI, Shreddy will often be dead on their first drive — and occasionally, on higher Karnage Levels, the first <em>play</em>.
</li><li> As a species, Criminal Aliens tend to be quite speedy and nimble, but can only eat a hit or two before they croak, while also lacking the strength to consistently tackle. They almost encourage you to exploit their propensity for dying, since they hit everyone around them with quite potent acidic blood upon death. Consequently, the all-alien Galaxy Chaos are spectacular on offense, but give up a lot of points because their speedy defenders can't bring down the ballcarrier.
</li></ul></li><li> The ninja in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/N" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/N">N</a></em>. Fast enough to outrun missiles on a straightaway, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> that can be killed by anything.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris">Nectaris</a></em>, the CBX-1 Panther is the fastest land unit in the game. Unfortunately, being motorized infantry doesn't make its attack or defense ratings better than the infantry average, which is rather pathetic. Their most effective use is not in fighting land or air units (though they can do both) but to seize neutral factories before the other side's infantry can capture them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> video games:
<ul><li> Vert (and even more so in her goddess form, Green Heart) is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">magical</a> speedster of the goddesses; fast, agile, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">capable of dumping tons of magic damage upon her enemies, but is usually the first to go down in the more prolonged and difficult fights.</a>
</li><li> IF is a great example of this trope; while being easily one of the most fragile Makers in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">multiverse</a>, she makes up for it by having the highest movement, agility, and speed in the cast. She's so fast in fact, she can practically dodge <em>every single attack thrown at her</em> until, you know, you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">unlucky.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods">Night in the Woods</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameWithinAGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameWithinAGame">Game Within a Game</a> <em>Demontower</em> gradually makes the player character into this. Each new level, you get another dash charge, but lose one heart of health. On the final level, you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> actually has a Fragile Speedster as a <em>Boss</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jeane</span> has remarkably low health for a boss, but can counter your grabs, dodge pretty much all of your attacks, and moves incredibly fast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth">Nocturne: Rebirth</a></em> has several enemies/familiars that fit this trope, like the cat family. Thanks to the battle formation system, the Speed Star formation ends up turning the entire party into this trope by increasing their speed and giving them a chance at consecutive turns at the cost of defense.
</li><li> <em>Ogame</em>:
<ul><li> Cruisers are the fastest warships of the game— only espionage probes are faster— and are excellent against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">light fighters and missile launchers</a>. However, they go down quickly once one can build Gauss cannons and (especially) Plasma turrets.
</li><li> Espionage probes, by far the fastest unit of the game, have no defenses of any kind and are destroyed easily; <em>all</em> other ships have rapid fire against them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneWayHeroics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneWayHeroics">One Way Heroics</a></em> has the Adventurer and Hunter classes, who can move faster than normal when they use the Dash skill, but have poor HP and vitality stats. The Adventurer can also use the Jump skill to skip two tiles ahead, making them even more mobile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> has the game's mascot, Tracer, who fulfils this trope among its lineup. She is extremely powerful at short range, has above average movement speed, and her lack of effectiveness at longer ranges is made up for through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> ability. However, she has the lowest health in the game at just 150 hit points, and so must use ambush tactics and her superior mobility to stay alive.
</li><li> Flank champions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins">Paladins</a></em> are the fastest and mobile of the four classes and can do a lot of damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant">up close</a>, but have the lowest health of all the champions and have pitiful range. The exception is Buck, who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> with more health than most champions except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Front Line</a> champs.
</li><li> The Virus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pandemic">Pandemic</a> 2</em>. Its fast evolution and high infectivity make it the quickest disease to play, but it's the most fragile and highly susceptible to the environment and drugs.
</li><li> The point of a dodge build in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em>. With the right skill build, a heister can move like greased lightning and most enemy shots will just whiz harmlessly by. However, many of those skills also require a high Concealment, which is often negatively correlated with armor and weapon strength. In other words, you'll have to stick to light or even no armor and weaker weapons. Good luck killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook">Heavily Armored Mooks</a>, and God forbid you actually take a hit or two, especially on higher difficulties. It's definitely not for newbies.
</li><li> Nei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII">Phantasy Star II</a></em> is stuck wearing a <em>Fibervest</em> by the time you're able to equip Ceramic gear on the rest of your party, but she'll nearly always strike first, which is helpful since she's made for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a>. Shir doesn't have it quite as badly as Nei, being even speedier and able to equip a Crystcape, or even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility">Neicape</a> if you decide not to give it to Amy.
</li><li> All Sloop-class ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnline">Pirates of the Caribbean Online</a></em>. They're faster than anything else, but also have the lowest health and hull defense of all player-controlled ships.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Planetside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Planetside">Planetside</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Vanu Magrider is the lightest of the three main tanks and the weakest in an open fight, but being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank">Hover Tank</a> lets it cross any terrain, it's amphibious, and it's the only tank that can strafe.
</li><li> In <em>2</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">ESFs</a> became this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> due to the prevalence of flak and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/G2A" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/G2A">G 2 A</a> missiles.
</li><li> Infantry with the Agile armour option get faster running than those with Reinforced armour, but less armour points and less inventory space.
</li></ul></li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> 'mons are faster with fewer defenses/hit-points:
<ul><li> Ninjask has one of the highest speed ratings in the game, plus an ability (Speed Boost) that makes it even faster. Not surprising, it has very low base Defense and HP.
</li><li> The Speed Forme of Deoxys has the highest Speed stat in the game at an incredible 180, and average stats everywhere else. It's mostly used to set up passive damage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a>, and then flee before taking too many hits. Even in Attack Form, it has virtually no Defense and most attacks will KO it in one hit.
</li><li> Accelgor, a <em>ninja slug</em> is ludicrously fast and has decent special attack, but its defenses are very poor.
</li><li> Electric Pokemon tend to fall under this. Electric Pokemon are basically the fastest type in the games (particuarly Electrode and Jolteon, which are in the top five of all Pokemon in terms of speed), but most of them share the same weakness: their base Defense is usually pretty low.
</li><li> Greninja is a rare Water type Fragile Speedster/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, finally taking away Starmie's crown as the fastest Water Pokémon in the game. However, while Starmie has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">respectable defenses to go with its speed and power</a>, Greninja is on the frail side, and can easily be done in by a well-placed Thunderbolt or Mach Punch. This is especially the case in competitive battling, where it's very popular to equip the amphibian ninja with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Life Orb</a>.
</li><li> Alakazam is one of the most notorious examples in the game. It's incredibly fast and is capable of one-shotting many opponents with its massive Special Attack, but its HP and Defense are ridiculously low. One physical attack and it is likely to go down. Its Special Defense is pretty good, but those low HP kind of offset that.
</li><li> Mienshao is very fast and hits very hard, but has trouble taking a hit. However, it can use U-Turn combined with its ability Regenerator to help offset this by dealing damage and taking it off the field, which heals a big chunk of the damage it took. It can also use Drain Punch to life-drain opponents.
</li><li> Zoroark is very fast and can hit hard with a variety of moves, but doesn't take hits very well.
</li><li> Cryogonal is very fast, but its Defense is bottom-of-the-barrel, and its typing doesn't help.
</li><li> Gengar is very fast and has incredibly high Special Attack, but it's on the frail side.
</li><li> Ribombee is notable for both being swift and able to throw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickySituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickySituation">Sticky Web</a> to slow down its further opponents. It also has nice offensive stats and some other decent status moves to cover. Yet the cute little fairy bug won't stand a good physical attack.
</li><li> Whimsicott is another fairy with its speediness taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>: not only it has a very high speed stat, it has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative">Prankster</a> ability to throw status effect and block hits before the opponent does the same. Yet it's not on the most powerful side and a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson">Poison Jab</a> sends him flying.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Ultra Beast</a> Pheromosa has extraordinary Speed — second only to Ninjask and Speed Deoxys — and excellent Attack stats on both the physical and special sides. What's more, its Beast Boost ability further increases its speed with each KO it scores. Its defenses, naturally, are abysmal.
</li><li> Any Pokémon that learns Shell Smash can doubles their attacking stats and speed while dropping both defenses. Give it a White Herb (to re-raise the defenses) and the Pokémon hits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> territory.
</li></ul></li><li> Helicopters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> are the only vehicles capable of outrunning Alex Mercer, by halfway through the game; however, they can be taken down by two, <em>normal</em>, non-musclemass enhanced flying kicks.
</li><li> Horses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> can outrun any predator in the game, and for good reason. Taking even a nibble while riding one will send you falling faster than you can draw a gun, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickDraw">and that's fast</a></em>.
</li><li> Fighter-archetype ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RingRunnerFlightOfTheSages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RingRunnerFlightOfTheSages">Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages</a></em> have poor shields, but excellent engines.

<ul><li> Add to that the eponymous TIE Fighters from the game of the same name. Fast and maneuverable, but a single laser blast is likely to cripple your flimsy little craft, and a second is almost guaranteed to turn it to scrap. TIE Bombers fare a little better, but it isn't until the TIE Advanced that the TIE series of ships (not counting the sluggish Assault Gunboat) can actually take a bit of a beating.
</li></ul></li><li> Sasha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RondoOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RondoOfSwords">Rondo of Swords</a></em> has great movement and terrible defense.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em> series has characters like Uesugi Kenshin, Fuuma Kotaro and Ishida Mitsunari. All of them have very high movement speed and attack speed and are good at stun-locking opponents (and in Kotaro's case the ability to combo infinitely in the air), but below-average attack, defense and HP values and end up in trouble if their opponents get on the offensive.
<ul><li> Kotaro's cameo in the anime also showcases this: He spends most of his fight with Takeda Shingen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Stepping</a> around the arena and wearing down Shingen's block, until a single well-placed punch sends him flying.

The problem is trying to hit him in the first place, as he has a buff skill, Red Capote, that raises his evasion (along with his accuracy) to maximum, and a missed attack causes the attacker's party to lose two turns instead of one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sinjid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sinjid">Sinjid</a>: Shadow of the Warrior</em>:
<ul><li> Shadow Ninjas and Assassins in the third game are the fastest of the available classes, but have low health.
</li><li> Assailants are very fast, making them hard to hit with any class that's not a Shadow Ninja, but they have poor physical defense. They also count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> because their attacks do damage based on speed, which is their best stat.
</li><li> The Poison Wasp is the fastest enemy faced in the Monster Portal, but isn't very sturdy.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Anti Ninja</span> is the fastest enemy in the game, making him really difficult to hit, but has non-existent defenses. He also falls into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> trope due to his high physical strength.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a></em> likes this trope. Most of the smallest ships (and generally least expensive, though there are exceptions) can run circles around their larger counterparts, dodging incoming projectiles with impunity and generally falling apart after half a second of actually getting hit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> has a number of these:
<ul><li> Terran Vultures are <em>the</em> fastest units in the game and are great at harassment and scouting, but aren't very durable and do little damage against anything that isn't a basic-tier unit or worker. With Spider Mines, they can outmanoeuvre and trap units that would otherwise destroy them in a straight fight. They generally tend to be relegated into a supporting role or used to support Siege Tanks against a Protoss Army; their attack helps kill off light-melee-infantry attacking the artillery and their mines create a nasty trap against an advancing army.
</li></ul><div class="indent">—<em>"Vulture Hover Bikes...they were fast, light and highly maneuverable and gave their riders about as much protection as a paper hat.""</em>
</div><ul><li> Zerglings are very frail but very fast early game melee units that can be used in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> to go for an early win. They get a bit trickier to use as each side unlocks stronger units.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> often has the Terran competitive scene using Reapers early on. They're quick, they deal extra damage to structures, and they can leap walls. Since they cost 50 vespene a pop, players have to be careful not to drain their economy too early by replacing fallen reapers because of carelessness. They're not a particularly durable unit, but make for great harassment.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefrontII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefrontII">Star Wars: Battlefront II</a></em>, on space maps, each faction has an Interceptor-type fighter that is much faster than the normal fighters, the bombers, or the shuttles but dies with a single missile hit. On the ground there are STAPs and speeder bikes, and the Republic and Imperial special jet pack troops combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront2015">Star Wars Battlefront (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Luke Skywalker takes hits less reliably than Vader and can't block for as long, but he has the highest running speed of the Heroes, a very maneuverable jump and a dash attack that can let send him flying through enemy hoards.
</li><li> Bossk is even faster than Luke, which can be even further enhanced when using his X-Ray vision ability. This comes at the cost of being rather lackluster defense, but since his trait lets him heal for every enemy he kills, he can compensate for it.
</li></ul></li><li> Corvettes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> are the smallest class of warship and the one you start with, characterised by their very low hit points and limited options for weapons and armour. However they have a whopping 80% Evasion rate, so even though an individual Corvette isn't very strong, it can last a surprisingly long time against large anti-ship artillery (which will flail around hopelessly trying to swat them out of space) and do decent damage for the low cost to build them. Swarms of Corvettes used to dominate the naval combat meta for several version cycles, at one point it was even totally cost-ineffective to even give them <em>any</em> upgrades as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">simply spamming the starting Corvette</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Sunrider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Sunrider">Sunrider</a></em>, the Phoenix has the best speed and evasion of the player-controlled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">Ryders</a>, spending only 10 energy to move one tile when most of the other Ryders need 20 or 30, but it also has the lowest base health. It also suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> since its swords and submachineguns excel at destroying enemy Ryders but are worthless against capital ships. It comes with a stealth generator that allows the Phoenix to get in an enemys face without being shot to pieces, and in <em>Sunrider Liberation Day</em> this can be upgraded to a cloaking device that prevents enemies from targeting her at all for one turn.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Vilkiss</a> has the highest base mobility of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV">Super Robot Wars V</a></em>, coupled with it's special ability "Ariel Mode"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2w1b0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2w1b0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2w1b0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At 130 will, 40% chance to completely evade an enemy attack</span> and Ange having one of the highest evasion stats in the game with a high leveled "Prevail". Unfortunately, one good solid hit and she goes down quite easily.

You can run faster and jump higher, but you also become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate">Syndicate</a></em> (2012), according to his infobank entry, Agent Tatsuo's augmentations are focused on speed at the expense of defense and regeneration.
</li><li> Repede in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>. His defense and HP are somewhat lower then some other members of the party, but has an ability that increases his movement speed in battle, and other abilities that activate when he makes use of Free Run, which make him excellent for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a>. He can still hold his own in a head-on fight in the hands of a skilled player, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Scout class is a potent hit-and-run fighter; good scouts can wreck an enemy team, taking out key targets like medics. But scouts die. They die and they die: every other class in the game can kill scouts efficiently. Sometimes the only way to survive even seconds is to exercise some good ol' fast-movin' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a>.
</li><li> The Soldier has a weapon called the Escape Plan, which increases his speed inversely compared to how much health he has. It also causes him to take 35% more damage while it's out <em>and</em> it greatly decreases healing rate from Medics, meaning that its use is limited to, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">escaping</a>.
</li><li> Engineer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentryGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentryGun">Combat Mini-Sentry</a> (available with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Gunslinger</a> equipped) manages to be one <em>without actually moving</em>. It has less health and firepower than normal sentries and cannot be upgraded, but is very cheap to build, deploys in mere seconds, aims and shoots very quickly, and has a tiny hitbox which lets it avoid a lot of damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters">TimeSplitters</a></em>: From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters2">second game</a> onward there are a couple of basic stat distributions for it's characters. The Monkey is the fastest and frailest, having 20 out of 20 for agility and 4 out of 20 for stamina.
</li><li> The Stryder titan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall">Titanfall</a></em> has the least health out of the three titans. To compensate, it has the highest move speed and can gain unlimited dashes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoMirageSessionsFE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoMirageSessionsFE">Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE</a></em> has Eleonora Yumizuru. She can deal a lot of damage with physical attacks due to her good Strength and critical hit rate, but she has the worst HP, defense, and resistance in the game. She can only survive in a fight because she has good evasion and some skills that reduce her chance of being targeted.
</li><li> Due to averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingBoulders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingBoulders">Homing Boulders</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em> provides some rare RTS examples. The Scouts/Fighter jets don't have much in the way of armor, hp, or attack (the Scout jet has no attack period!), but good luck actually hitting the damn things if they're at top speed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron">Transformers: War for Cybertron</a></em> has Fragile Speedsters in the form of the Scout (car) and Scientist (jet) classes. While the Scouts are the smallest, the Scientists are the fastest, have the greatest mobility due to flying over most obstacles ... and they have the tiniest health bars. Luckily, this also means they're really good at getting away from their opponents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasurePlanetBattleAtProcyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasurePlanetBattleAtProcyon">Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Imperial Torpedo Boats are the most fragile ship in the game, with only 350 HP, however they have a top speed of 40 kilometres per hours, as well as being well armed for a small ship, as they have two torpedo tubes, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> at the same time.
</li><li> All versions of the Sloop are relatively fast and lightly armoured, with the Procyon Sloop being the fastest, the Pirate Sloop being the best armoured, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Imperial Warsloop</a> being the worst in both aspects.
</li><li> Gunboats, both the Procyon and Pirate versions, with the Procyon Gunboat being slightly faster at 45 kilometres per hour, compared to the Pirate Gunboat at 43 kilometres per hour, making the Procyon Gunboat the fastest ship in the game. However, they are both very fragile, with the Procyon version only having 510 HP and the Pirate version having 580 HP.
</li></ul></li><li> Oxjack's set in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwentyXX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwentyXX">20XX</a></em> makes you into one, compared to the other three sets (although you can load up on as many bonus health points as you can get with any of them). Tanky Armatort, power-focused Owlhawk and straight-up blaster Dracopent all have at least <em>something</em> that lets them restore health or improve efficiency on normal health recovery, while all Oxjack gets is a shield that comes online while dashing - but Oxjack's arm improves attack charge time, the head improves dash speed, and the legs permit air-dashing, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus">Set Bonus</a> allowing three air-dashes per jump.
</li><li> The end of the Genocide route in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sans the skeleton</span>, the hardest boss in the game. This boss's stats are lower than anything else you encounter, at 1 HP, 1 Defense and 1 Attack. However, actually landing a hit on them proves to be almost impossible, and while the attacks they use against you really do inflict only 1 damage apiece, they ignore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a>, meaning that these attacks inflict 1 damage per framethat's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">40 damage per second.</a></em> They also inflict a poison-like status that ticks down at 1 damage per second. Worse still, these attacks move quickly and move in hard-to-dodge patterns, bringing this trope to its logical extreme.
</li><li> The Manta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII">Unreal Tournament III</a></em> is very fast and a great choice for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">Car Fu</a> against enemies on foot. On the downside, it has the lowest HP of any vehicle, gets taken out by a single anti-vehicle rocket, and is easily knocked around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts">Vandal Hearts</a> II</em> has perhaps one of the purest examples of this in the form of a unique piece of light armor called L-mach; any character wearing it has their Movement increased by 30 and thus can cross an entire map in one or two turns... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">but their max health is reduced to ONE</a>.

He can develop the ability to wear heavier armor at higher levels; but his low HP and defense keep him a Fragile Speedster, although still more resilient than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">the mage Evie</a>. With the right skill build, he can become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> at very high levels.
</li><li> Fei-Yen, the fastest virtuaroid and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn">Virtual-ON</a></em>, has very fragile armor and weak attack until she activates her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">panic mode</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Night Elf Archer is the frailest of all basic units (in the original, they barely had more HP than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Unit</a>). However, they have the ability to catch a ride on a Hippogryph, allowing them to fly off much faster than walking, and dealing the same damage.
</li><li> Most flyers in the game tend to be this, going down very quickly to even a few ranged units.
</li></ul></li><li> Loki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> is not a very durable warframe, but he has higher-than-average sprint speed and abilities that help him in an effective getaway.

They're very agile, able to make quick zig-zag turns and dodge like crazy in speeds in excess of 50 kph, but very few have any armor to speak of, and fairly low HP besides. Best exemplified by the German Lights like the Panzer I C, a teeny tiny tank that pulls 79 kph, turns at 48 degrees per second, and has only 210 hp—enough to be taken out in a single hit by the Tier 4s and 5s it will very likely encounter. Its thickest armor is 30mm, which is actually insufficient to keep it safe against some Tier <em>1</em> guns.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> besides the Rogue and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">Feral</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Druid</a>, there's the new hero class the Demon Hunter.

However, they wear leather armor and have almost no natural avoidance, relying almost entirely on healing themselves by consuming the souls of enemies they kill.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> games:
<ul><li> M5 class ships (scouts) go extremely fast but die with a couple blasts from a heavy fighter's cannon or a single shot from a capital ship weapon, and ships made by the Boron move fast but have weak shields. Ships made by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Split</a> are very fast and have pathetic shielding, though they have more firepower.
</li><li> <em>X3</em> has two racing ships; the slower one is easily twice as fast as the third-fastest ship in the game, and the fastest is really <em>unfeasibly</em> fast - you can easily smack into things if you're not very careful. Both have essentially no shielding, but nothing in the game has a realistic chance of ever managing to land a hit on either ship.
</li><li> Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude have the Teladi Kestrel and it's pirate variant, which are the two fastest armed ships in the game. The latter can only be caught by one type of missile.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Fisher,_1st_Baron_Fisher">Admiral Sir John Fisher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is famous for saying "speed is armor," and was a proponent of battlecruisers, which were warships as heavily armed as a battleship, but with armor no more than that of a cruiser. The resultant trade-off in armor made them faster than the battleships of their day, but in turn made them vulnerable to just about anything better-armed than a cruiser.
<ul><li> The most fragile of all were the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courageous-class_battlecruiser">Courageous-class battlecruisers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, also known rather aptly as "large light cruisers". Even faster than most battlecruisers with a top speed of 32 knots, their armor was almost nonexistent (while most battlecruisers had protection on par with an armored cruiser, the Courageous-class were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">armored like the smaller light cruisers</a>. Having proved to be quite useless in World War I, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courageous-class_aircraft_carrier">all three were converted into aircraft carriers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The final nail in the coffin of the battlecruiser was the newer battleship designs that had equivalent (or better) speed, thus rendering the entire concept pointless.
</li><li> Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> warships were designed in a similar way, sacrificing armor for increased speed. As they had seen what had happened to the British battlecruisers, they were designed for a completely different use: cruisers would engage the immediately smaller class of enemy warship of the French fleet, matching their speed to chase them down while using their superior firepower to sink them, while destroyers would use their superior speed to either make hit-and-run attacks on convoys in spite of the escorts or try and torpedo enemy battleships while dodging their counterfire that would have quickly crippled or killed a conventionally armored destroyer anyway (battleships, on the other hand, were well armored, as their main job was still engaging enemy battleships). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">While theoretically good enough to deal with the French fleet, the more aggressive, versatile and carried-supported Royal Navy was something the Italian Navy could not face</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Destroyers, up until the end of WWII. Generally the fastest ships utilized in fleet roles, the massive engines needed to propel the ships to such speeds meant modest armament, short range, and absolutely no armor whatsoever. But while high-explosive shells of any caliber would rapidly shred them, destroyers were so fast and maneuvered so wildly that fire control systems of the era simply couldn't cope. The only solution was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">blanket the general area in shells and hope something hit.</a> And since destroyers carried torpedoes, they could hurt much larger ships - assuming they survived long enough.
</li><li> Cruiser tanks. The "cruiser tank" was a British inter-war innovation: an armored fighting vehicle which would perform the same tasks on land as cruisers at sea, namely scouting, outflanking, harassing the enemy and destroying his logistics. The British went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> on tanks: they developed heavy, well-armored but slow infantry tanks and fast, light cruiser tanks. Cruiser tanks were light, fast and had excellent range, but they had paper-thin armor and puny QF 2 lb (40 mm) "peashooter" cannon, which on top of their small caliber lacked any high-explosive rounds at all. They were on their own element on open terrain, such as desert, where they could fully employ their mobility, but suffered horribly at close terrain. In 1943 latest the British noticed their doctrine was flawed, and both were eventually replaced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">main battle tank</a>. The last cruiser tank, Cromwell, is often considered as the prototype for main battle tank.
</li><li> Cheetahs. They're the frailest of the big cats and they have to eat quickly because of their inability to defend their kills from other carnivores, but they're the fastest land animal alive. In fact, they're so lightly built that they have difficulty pulling down a prey animal that's standing still, so they use their speed itself as a weapon: they intentionally startle antelopes into running at top speed, overtake them, and trip them.
</li><li> Thoroughbreds and Greyhounds. Both are the fastest examples of their species, reaching speeds averaging around 40 mph. Pretty outrageous for a horse or dog. However, that speed is usually accomplished in conjunction with skin like tissue paper and bones like a bird's. Just ask anyone who's owned either of these animals, and they will give you lists of examples of their porcelain-like fragility.
</li><li> Most birds tend work like this, discounting flightless species like ostriches and emus. Generally, birds can cover far more distance than any other animal in a given time frame, and many birds of prey are apex predators in their respective habitat. However, most birds have light skeletons with hollow bones to maximize stamina in the air, so they're at a disproportionately high risk for skeletal injury.
</li><li> Russian blues, and some other meek breeds of house cats who just want to get along with the world, are lightweight, relatively delicate and ill-suited for the harsh environment outside. As a result, any fight-happy street-smart tomcat would beat the stuffing out of a Russian blue with ease... if it could catch it. They're so fast that the main reason their owners are discouraged from letting them outside isn't that other cats will wallop them - it's that if they feel threatened they'll bolt so quickly they might easily find themselves in unknown territory and might not know how to come back home.
</li><li> Skirmishers. Traditionally, these were specialist foot soldiers or horsemen tasked with conducting reconnaissance and disrupting the enemy without being drawn into combat with them, which necessitated a comparatively high degree of mobility and the ability to strike enemy with minimal risk of retaliation. As such, they tended to be lightly armored at best, and operated in smaller groups than most other formations. While such troops were able to move around more freely than otherwise and presented a smaller target to the enemy, it also meant that they tended to be outnumbered and would generally lose a straight fight.
</li><li> Many super fast cars. Fast yes, but be wary if you crash.
<ul><li> Racing cars in general are <em>extremely</em> delicate and fragile - even sturdy looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> stock cars' bodywork can be shredded by a blown out tire - except when it comes to the driver's safety zone. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> cars the monocoque 'survival cell' is made of stabilized carbon and steel and is basically indestructible, even at ridiculous speeds. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> and other touring and rally cars the driver is encased in a solid roll cage. The peripheral parts however, like suspension or wings, will break if they come into <em>any</em> kind of force acting <em>in the wrong direction</em>. The front wings and suspension especially can withstand huge loads pressing down on them but are so delicate in a forward facing collision that almost every driver had at least once a race ruined because they touched something they shouldn't have touched. Like the back of another car. This is partly for performance reasons as lighter cars will be faster, but also for safety as the peripheral parts will dissipate the forces of the impact away from the driver.
</li><li> By contrast <em>any</em> road-legal car (with the exception of some really high-end supercars) going faster than about 80 mph is subject to this trope; no crumple zone or airbag could possible dissipate that amount of energy, and weight considerations (which is why trucks are safer) aren't quite as relevant when you're hitting a solid object, which is usually what happens.
</li><li> The Classic Mini was designed as a very small car before anyone thought of crumple zones; the engineers thus stressed giving the car the best possible handling ability in order to give the driver the tools to avoid crashing under the widest possible range of circumstances.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterham_Cars#Superlight_R500">Caterham R500<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it has no doors, no roof, no air bags, practically nothing in the way of any sort of safety features. That said, it has a power to weight ratio of 500 BHP per ton, can out-accelerate a Ferrari Enzo, the fastest road legal Ferrari ever made, and on a track it can beat the Bugatti Veyron, the fastest production car ever made. Because it's essentially an engine strapped to the bare minimum of parts to classify a vehicle as a car it can accelerate like mad and since it's so light a driver can wait until the last conceivable moment to start braking before a turn. Not bad for a car that's barely been changed since 1957.
</li><li> Any racing car designed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Colin Chapman</a>. Drivers who raced his Lotus-cars in their prime said that while they are incredibly fast and light, they are also mobile death traps. Many drivers, sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">fell victim to his creations</a>. He is still regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, innovator in F1 design though.

Averted in 2011 when the Red Bulls rarely suffered any mechanical failures and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">#1 driver</a> Sebastian Vettel dominated the championship.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> likened driving a Porsche in London to "bringing a Ming vase to a football game."
</li></ul></li><li> Boffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LARP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LARP">LARP</a> players usually know at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Skinny Fast Kid</a>. They're usually male, between the age of 16 and 25, and a new enough player that they can't deal or take much damage. Even a low level NPC could take them out, if they could just catch them. If a Skinny Fast Kid decides to play a NPC, beware. There is a story about Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">Tolkien</a>-based yearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LARP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LARP">LARP</a>, <em>Hobbit Games</em>. One year they had a rule that players without armor have 1 HP, armor with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">RL</a> protection gives +1 HP, historically accurate (therefore heavy) armor gives more HP bonus. At one point one camp needed to send a messenger to allied camp a few kilometers away through enemy territory. On a hot summer day. The messenger decided to run unarmed and wearing only swimming trunks. Nobody managed to catch him.
</li><li> The American-built F-104 Starfighter was a supersonic fighter aircraft that was, among other things, slightly faster than the F-16 Fighting Falcon, cheaper than the F-5E Tiger II, and better armed than the Soviet Su-15 Flagon. It was a Mach 2 capable interceptor, and was a pants-browning terror to fly. It got the apt nickname "The Missile with a Man in it": its high speed, low cost, and moderate firepower came at the expense of protection and the ability to actually <em>control</em> the damned thing in any role other than as an interceptor. It was notoriously easy to damage or crash a Starfighter, even when you weren't trying. Air forces who presses the F-104 into light bomber roles found this out the hard way. Heaven help you when the enemy wanted a turn to actually <em>try</em>. This led to a record of safety issues (most notably, the forward edges of the wings were so thin and razor-sharp that they were actually <em>hurting unwary ground crews</em>) and many less-than-flattering nicknames like "The Widow Maker," "Tent Peg" (<em>Erdnagel</em>), or most evocatively, "The Lawn Dart."
</li><li> The MiG-25 "Foxbat" is the fastest armed aircraft <em>ever</em>, with a high flight ceiling and a fairly fast rate of climb as well; all of these characteristics are highly desirable for interceptor aircraft in order to quickly gain height and keep up with high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and bombers. However, it's practically useless in a dogfight against other fighters, as it has no internal gun and can't turn very quickly. Also qualifies as fragile outside of combat because its engines had to be frequently replaced. It was typically operated no faster than Mach 2.5 - its airspeed indicator was redlined at Mach 2.85 - but it was capable of flying at Mach 3.2. The particular aircraft that was observed at this speed <em>destroyed its engines in flight.</em>
</li><li> The American SR-71 Blackbird is an even more extreme example. The fastest manned, air-breathing vehicle ever, but completely unarmed. It leaks fuel like a sieve when it's on the runway—which fuel, by the way, was so exotic it was used as coolant—but it <em>has to</em> as it heats up so much in flight due to the speed that it needs a loose fit to compensate for the expansion. It fits this trope even more once you consider its primary defense from enemy fire—it outran it. With a cruising speed of a little over Mach 3 (about as fast as a bullet and faster than most missiles at the time of its design) and with a service ceiling of roughly 25 km (80,000 feet), it relied on no armor what so ever. Instead of maneuvering or launching a volley of countermeasures to avoid enemy fire, Blackbird pilots instead responded by simply accelerating to a point that no aircraft could catch them, no shell could strike them, and no missile could go fast enough to challenge them. Having an especially low (for the time) radar cross section was just overkill. Of course, being an unarmed strategic scout that was not weighed down by weapons helped—it was built to do nothing but fly fast and take pictures<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37v2y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note37v2y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37v2y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The SR-71 was originally designed to launch <em>drones</em>, serving as a launch platform for early UAVs, until it was realized that the SR-71 could go <em>higher</em> than the drones, fly <em>faster</em>, and were much easier to recover.</span>, which meant it could specialize in its roles quite well. There could have been an interceptor based on the A-12 (a slightly earlier version of the SR-71). Three prototypes were built and 93 were ordered by the Air Force, unfortunately at the time the Vietnam War ate up so much money that the order was never fulfilled.
</li><li> The North American P-51 Mustang used by the American and British air forces in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was one of the fastest piston-engined fighters of the war and <em>the</em> longest-ranged with a single engine, but was very vulnerable to enemy fire. Most inline-engined aircraft in general were relatively frail compared to radial-engined planes (although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Il-2 Sturmovik</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IL2Sturmovik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IL2Sturmovik">flight sim fame</a> was a major exception, earning nicknames like "Concrete Plane" and "Flying Tank") due to their liquid cooling, but the Mustang's radiators and coolant lines were particularly vulnerable, making <em>any</em> hit forward of the cockpit a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.
</li><li> The infamous Japanese A6M Zero; early models armor or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheFuelTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheFuelTank">self-sealing fuel tanks</a>, but its strength was more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtfulDodger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtfulDodger">agility</a> than pure speed—it was actually quite slow by 1943, able to easily outfly American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Hellcats</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Corsairs</a> but unable to outrun them and thus very vulnerable to high-speed power dives.
<ul><li> This was the standard for Japanese combat air manufacturing up until about 1944- many of their fighters and bombers were pathetically armored even by the standards of the late 1930s when they were designed, but they were generally faster, better armed, more maneuverable, and had better operating range than most of their contemporaries. It was only when the Allies recovered a few downed Japanese aircraft and began designing planes to counter them that things began taking a turn for the worst and losses mounted up. By 1944 Japan did shift towards designing better defended craft, and a late-war <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawanishi_N1K">N1K1 "George"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakajima_Ki-84">Ki-84 "Frank"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> could easily match a Hellcat or Corsair in a fight, but by this time most of the Japanese best pilots had been killed and the new planes did not have much effect on the outcome of the war.
</li></ul></li><li> The German Me-163 Komet was a rocket-propelled interceptor aircraft designed to kill bombers and capable of speeds close to the speed of sound. In fact, it was <em>too</em> fast - often zooming by the slow-moving bombers before the pilots could line up a shot. Its frame was made of wood, and its light construction made it very vulnerable to enemy fire, relying almost totally on its blistering speed for defense. There was even a risk of the plane disintegrating on landing, though it was hardly helped by the fact that its landing gear consisted of a single skid. And if by any means the 2-part rocket fuel-oxidiser came into contact it exploded immediately, a problem if it mixed anywhere but the rocket nozzle.
</li><li> The British DeHavilland Mosquito was a light bomber designed from the ground up for speed. Built with an all-wooden airframe which was both lightweight and easy to manufacture (many Mosquito parts were made by small furniture or piano manufacturers throughout the UK rather than in specialized plants that were easier targets for air raids) and maintain, it was for a while the fastest aircraft in the RAF, beating out the famous Spitfire fighter in speed trials. It also had no defensive armament whatsoever and its wooden airframe was highly vulnerable to enemy fire. The Mosquito still had lower loss rates than any other RAF bomber in the war (and one of the lowest loss rates of bombers in the entire war, period) simply because it was an extremely hard target to catch. By the time defending fighters could be vectored in to intercept, the "Mossies" would already have finished their bombing runs and be racing back for home. It also excelled at stealthy low-altitude precision raids and as a target-marking "Pathfinder" aircraft for larger bomber formations. Later variants of the Mosquito would be equipped with steadily heavier armaments, culminating in the FB Mk. XVIII model, designed for hunting submarines and light surface ships and equipped with a <em>57mm autoloading anti-tank cannon</em>, effectively crossing over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">another trope altogether</a>.
</li><li> Tank destroyers in general (excepting the M36, which had fairly respectable forward armor), the M18 Hellcat in particular. The Hellcat clocked in at 60mph (97km/h) on road, making it the fastest armored fighting vehicle of the war, used a long-barreled version of the 76mm gun used by the Sherman... and had only 5 to 25 millimeters (0.2 to 1 inch(es)) of armor depending on location. Modern wheeled tank destroyers have the heavy gun of a MBT and superior speed (the <em>slower</em> has a speed of 85 kph (53 mph)), but have paper-thin armor (the Italian B1 Centauro 120 mm and B1 Centauro II, the two with the best armor, can only resist guns up to 40mm caliber, and only from the front arc).
</li><li> Motorcycles have a superior power-to-weight ratio compared to automobiles, allowing even an average bike to outclass an exotic sports car in acceleration and, in some cases, top speed. However, they are also considered one of the most unsafe modes of transportation on the road today because of the risk of being easily thrown off by one of the millions of drivers operating 2+ ton cars, trucks, and vans.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_%28vehicle%29">Technicals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are made of this trope. Being nothing more than simple pickup trucks with light weaponry (sometimes not even <em>that</em> light; some technicals are large pickups or even flatbed trucks with light tank turrets or howitzers mounted on the back) attached to the back they can't deal or take much damage compared to more heavily armed and armored vehicles. However in comparison they're much quicker and more maneuverable, capable of hitting targets and getting out of the line of fire before the enemy has time to properly respond.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> players:
<ul><li> Quarterback Robert Griffin III is famed for his ability in a "read option" offense, to make quick decisions to throw the ball to a receiver, hand it off to a running back, or run it ahead himself. Unfortunately, he seems ... <em>uniquely</em> prone to injury while being tackled. In 2009, he tore his ACL (a knee ligament) while still in college. In his 2012 rookie season in Washington, he tore his other ACL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">and his LCL</a>. In 2014, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">he dislocated his ankle</a>. In a 2015 preseason game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">he suffered a concussion</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">The Redskins signed him because of his speed.</a>
</li><li> Before Robert Griffin, there was Michael Vick. Probably the greatest running quarterback in NFL history, his speed frequently bamboozled defenders, even at age 30. He also finished a full sixteen-game season exactly once in 8 years as a full-time starter.
</li><li> "Burners", in NFL parlance, are Wide Receivers that rely on straight-line speed to make plays, and fit this trope to a T. Players like Cliff Branch, Joey Galloway, or DeSean Jackson would routinely leave defensive backs grasping for air as they waltzed into the end zone. However, this speed tended to come with a lack of size and toughness that left them limited to deep routes, and thus specialized roles in the offense.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams">Liverpool</a> Striker Daniel Sturridge is fast, pacy, and great at scoring, but very injury prone.
</li></ul></li><li> The prehistoric marine crocodile <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metriorhynchus">Metriorhynchus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> shows that this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>—unlike most known crocodilians, <em>Metriorhynchus</em> lacked osteoderms (armored scales), having most likely lost them in its evolutionary history to make it a faster and more efficient swimmer. However, this left it more vulnerable to attack, especially seeing as it shared the oceans with 20+ foot long leviathans like <em>Liopleurodon</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WayneGretzky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WayneGretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> spent his professional career about 20 lbs lighter than the average NHL player. He was also physically the weakest player on the Oilers during his time with the team, only able to bench press 140 lbs. In spite of all that, his speed and skill made him the most accomplished hockey player of all time.
