<div class="indent">— <strong>Thomas Sowell</strong>
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>While you don't need to know how a gun works to know how to use one, the society as a whole must be able to support the thinkers and builders of such a device for it to see widespread and sustained use. Not so when you have Low Culture High Tech; this is a faction, culture, or race that uses technology far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge, often for warfare.
</p><p>Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi">this group has pirated the technology from someone else</a>. It may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that they have recovered and use, often very sturdy, self-replicating lost tech that only requires raw materials be input, if even that. Or it could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a> tech that none of their existing machines can do without. There may instead be a group of "thinkers and builders" who use the primitives as shock troops or even as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a>. It's also possible the tables are turned and the primitives have either taken the builders hostage or killed them all and taken all of their goodies (without bothering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">with the instruction manual</a>). If the original source of the tech is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a>, they may become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult">Cargo Cult</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Typically, the primitives will only use a fraction of the technology's potential and not know all of its abilities. At best they will be able to maintain the equipment without knowing how to repair it should a major malfunction happen. It's highly possible that the original creators, or a group with sufficiently advanced science (even just curiosity and a working knowledge of the scientific method), can pull the rug out from under these primitives by either confiscating, hacking, or better using their pirated tech against them.
</p><p>It's worth noting that a civilization doesn't have to be at stone age or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">Medieval</a> levels of technology for this trope to apply. They just have to routinely use tech far in advance of their ability to comprehend. A story set in 21st-century Earth could have this trope apply if the planet were given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">Imported Alien Phlebotinum</a>. Even space faring peoples can have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech">Low Culture, High Tech</a> if they use stuff they don't understand.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Lastly, we want to draw attention to the following from the first paragraph "far in advance of their scientific and <strong>cultural</strong> knowledge". It's important to point out that not only are they using things they don't understand technologically, but for which they haven't considered the cultural, social, or ethical ramifications. It's one thing to give a hunter-gatherer society an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBow">Energy Bow</a>, but giving them a cloning device? Their society may crumble from the onset of massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Cloning Blues</a>, not to mention the ecological disaster of the massive population growth. It's because of this that many aliens (and future humanity) tend to subscribe to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady">You Are Not Ready</a> attitude.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> there are caches of weapons from Earth scattered over the continent of Halkeginia, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">Medieval European Fantasy</a> land. It is the result of a spell that is constantly pulling weapons from Earth for quite some time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>: The airships rely on engines that reflect technology from before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Seven Days of Fire</a>. Several times throughout the manga, characters scramble to recover the engines from downed ships as they are the only components that are irreplaceable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: The Saiyans are a brutal race of violent barbarians with a constantly warring society built entirely on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> political system. They initially lived in stone huts and wore simple fur, but (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">depending on who you listen to</a>) they gained high-tech after they reverse engineered the technology of their advanced neighbors after wiping them out, or got it after being recruited into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Planet Trade Organization</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>. They have access to technology far beyond their normal capabilities, such as interplanetary spaceships, healing pods and incredibly durable, flexible and lightweight body armor, Scouters capable of reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">Power Levels</a>, as well as an assortment of other high-tech goodies.
<ul><li> The initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale">Fractured Fairy Tale</a> riff on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheWest">Journey to the West</a></em> utilized this as part of the humour. Alongside all the other things <em>Dragon Ball</em> does completely differently from the original work, the central characters travel around on motorbikes, a hovercraft, a double-decker camper, a Fiat 500 and a WWII Jeep as they travel through wuxia China.
</li><li> Following from the above note, this occurs overall in regards to Earth. While the story always had light science fiction elements, the introduction of West City showed a clear divide of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">Jetsons</a></em>-like cities with traditional Chinese countryside. Where this trope comes into effect is when the technology from the cities pops up in said countryside: Master Roshi, an old hermit living on an island, is able to transport his house by shrinking it into a Capsule, while the Ox-King rewards Goku and friends with a hovercraft (this after they put out the fire engulfing his castle full of treasure). This even gets mixed in with vehicles that use tech from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, which is still high-tech for the areas it appears in.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>: This is the case for the Zentraedi. They have access to very powerful warships and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualInterstellarTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualInterstellarTravel">Casual Interstellar Travel</a>, as well as reproduction exclusively via cloning. However, they don't have a clue how any of their technology actually works. They can't innovate new technologies, and can't even repair what gets broken. Everything they have is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a> manufactured by fully automated factories, which are themselves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a>. This is one reason they were so interested in human society even before they discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienArtsAreAppreciated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienArtsAreAppreciated">music and entertainment</a>: humans had demonstrated the ability to repair broken tech, which the Zentraedi wanted to obtain for themselves.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em>, the Vers have access to some of the greatest technology in the known universe, but their culture is so lacking that the only thing holding it together is an incredibly half-baked religion and resentment against the people of Earth.

Similarly, the Minbari were given advanced technology by the Vorlons, and the humans ended up acquiring Shadow technology. In both of the later cases, the younger races were hard at work figuring out how the technology worked so they could apply it to their own designs.

Between this and their pride imposing them to perfect everything, they became the most advanced of the Younger Races bar the Minbari, and, at least in some fields (most notably energy weapons), aren't too far behind them either.

After landing and threatening the people of Earth with destruction, they overplay their hand, as the Earthlings do not, in fact, tremble before the power of their mighty flintlock muskets.

SG-1 gets a lot of tech they only barely understand, and later on the Asgard gift humanity with a database and replicator for all of their advanced tech (which most likely will take centuries to reverse-engineer everything). The Goa'uld purposely make their (also pirated) tech user friendly for the Jaffa to use.
</li><li> The Jaffa, whose society is almost identical in theme to the page image. They expertly utilize the extremely advanced technology provided by the Goa'uld, even to the point of flying their motherships for them. Yet Chulak, the Jaffa homeworld, is apparently still stuck in the Middle Ages.
</li><li> The Tollan deliberately invoke this with "primitive" societies that haven't reached their technological level. They once gifted their technology to another species to help them, and as a result the species wiped itself out <em>in a single day.</em> Since then they have been extremely leery about sharing tech with anyone else, even Earth.
</li><li> One episode in particular has SGC retrofit a Goa'uld fighter with Earth-tech modifications and show it off to other members of the military. On a test run they accidentally triggered a homing program that tried to return it to its point of origin across the galaxy at sublight speeds. Given that SGC didn't have anything nearly fast enough to retrieve the ship and crew they had to call for help from the Tok'ra, who berates them for slapping an Air Force label on a ship they didn't understand. Later episodes showed they learned enough about the technology to build comparable fighters from scratch and eventually made their own battleships. Bonus points for the person berating them being a former US Air Force general (implanted with a Tok'ra symbiote), so he knows how things work on Earth.
</li><li> It is often pointed out that the Goa'uld aren't all that different. They are just as 'unready' for certain Ancient technologies and this seems to be one of the things that causes the large amount of infighting that allowed human and Jaffa to overthrow them. Despite the Goa'uld having stolen the capacity for interstellar flight thousands of years ago, the Ancients and Asgard are still sufficiently far beyond them. Both of those races had reached intergalactic flight technology (with at least the Ancients even having traveled to galaxies outside their original local cluster long before their technological peak) before the Goa'uld even got off their original planet.

Until the Cardassian occupation, their culture and civilization remained rooted as it had been 10,000 years prior, and despite having had space flight many millennia before the beginning of human civilization, they never attempted to purposefully move much beyond their star system - colonizing only local moons and developing only minimal new technologies in that time while continuing to live by a caste system of farmers, artisans, and religious leaders. Ironically, one of the few places they may have visited outside their star system was Cardassia.

From all appearances they are a fully nomadic civilization totally dedicated to the hunt.

When Janeway broke The Prime Directive and gave them holodeck technology they lacked the cultural understanding to use it wisely, resulting in massive numbers of deaths in and out of the Hirogen population and creating a new photonic civilization, and also had to task a select few with being its sole maintainers and operators.

Weapons like a lasrifle can be reliably produced across the galaxy, but more advanced devices like plasma weapons are less understood, and some of the Imperium's oldest technological artifacts are irreplaceable because no one knows how to build them anymore. How much the AdMech knows about their sacred technology is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">dependent on the author</a> — in some accounts they're the only humans in the galaxy aware of the scientific method, or are deliberately playing up the rituals to keep laymen from getting involved (and potentially repeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">"Men of Iron"</a> disaster). But in general, any technological progress the Imperium makes happens very slowly, and for the most part its tech level is either stagnant or in decline. <br/><br/>In the backstory, the technology humans used to colonize the galaxy was deliberately designed to allow this. The STC systems that contained all the plans for things colonies might need were themselves incredibly advanced technology based on a deep understanding of physics, but the plans they produced were cunningly designed so that no particular understanding or even mechanical skill was needed to build even the most advanced of technologies. All of these systems, and the knowledge behind them, were lost in a galactic Dark Age more than ten thousand years previous. This makes intact printouts the most valuable things in the galaxy, and a working system is practically the Holy Grail.

Justified since the Orks were a last ditch effort by the Old Ones to create a race of living weapons to fight the Necrons and the C'tan.

</li><li> This trope is one of the reasons suggested in <em>1001 Science Fiction Weapons</em> for the OGL system, as a potential explanation for the existence of the many melee weapons in the book created with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedArchaicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedArchaicWeapon">advanced technology</a>, from regular swords made from alloys and composite materials far beyond modern technology to warhammers made out of hyperdense materials with a little antigravity motor inside in order to allow the use of little anime-esque schoolgirl characters wielding hammers that weigh five tons or more (they become unusable when the power runs out, as not so many sci-fi settings allow playable races that can lift that.) The idea being that advanced races develop these things for their more primitive hirelings who are more familiar with more primitive weapons but need a technological edge when it is uneconomical to train them with gun-shaped energy weapons, unlikely as that sounds. It also provides the rationale for many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowawayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowawayGuns">disposable weapons</a> in the book; the "idiot guns" series are meant for warlords to issue to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> who can't read with a minimum of training (hence the pictorial instructions on the outside) resulting in not so much a gun as a claymore mine that is held onto, while the Liberator assault shotgun is an automatic shotgun meant to be dropped to rebel and extremist groups who can't be trusted to care for a firearm, for purposes of slaughtering many people as messily as possible, and therefore cannot be reloaded and may as well be tossed out when empty, as it doesn't make a very good club.

</li><li> This technically applies to <em>all</em> races in the setting, since they are purposefully manipulated from trying to explore or understand the technology and principles behind the Citadel and the Mass Relays. Before the Protheans altered the Keepers to prevent them opening the hidden Mass Relay built into the Citadel itself, millions of years worth of Cycles ended with the Reapers showing up and taking control of the Citadel, locking down the Mass Relays and declaring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> to the entire galaxy.

<ul><li> Every game is like this, with only a few of the most advanced factions (Brotherhood of Steel, Enclave) actually understanding any technology more complicated than basic firearms and explosives, although other factions do utilise them, thanks to it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a>.
<ul><li> And all of the factions who understand the technology selfishly guard it because of the advantage it gives them.

</li><li> Even the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave can be argued to fall under the "low culture" part of this trope. The Brotherhood of Steel in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">the West</a> has fallen into dogmatism and fundamentalism and makes no attempt to improve their technology, research new ones or actually put it to use, and they mostly focus on military technology to the detriment of more mundane but still incredibly practical ones like agriculture. The only thing they do is hoard technology and wait for "when the time is right" while other factions like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">NCR</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Followers of the Apocalypse</a> just move on and in the case of the NCR, manage to actually force the Brotherhood of Steel into hiding. It's gotten so bad that when Elder Lyons of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Capital Wasteland</a> attempted to actually use their technology and manpower to make a difference in the Wasteland he was branded a traitor and suffered a civil war. The Enclave meanwhile has learned no lesson from the Old World and the Great War and attempts to pursue cruel genocide of the entirety of mainland North America and even the world beyond so that the "Master Race" (read "any human who has not been exposed to mutagens, such as the Enclave or people in Vaults") can reclaim the world.
</li></ul></li><li> Applies to the Pre-War society as well. Even in 2077, with an abundance of futuristic technology at their disposal, America (and perhaps the entire world) remained culturally locked in the 1950s.

Later he would "civilise" three tribes into governing his casinos, while he himself maintained New Vegas' independence from NCR annexation by using his Securitron army to prevent any attempt to take over the Strip.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RimWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RimWorld">RimWorld</a></em> plays this both forwards and backwards, as the background concept is that on any given rim world there are distinct cultures that interact with each other but are nonetheless living at very different tech levels. In game terms, your own faction begins at either "tribal" or "colony" (space-faring but stranded) level, which dictates which technologies on the extensive tech tree will be pre-learned. Anybody can use the products of any technology (e.g., scavenged weapons, advanced medicines bought from a trader), but to make something yourself may require research—a lot of research. It works both ways, in that beginning at a higher tech level leaves some more primitive techs locked, and actually puts you at a disadvantage when you try to research them. For example, colonist types have forgotten how to brew beer.

The nomadic way of life and traditional social structures that prevailed before oil begin to break down as young people head to the boom towns, producing crime and unrest. As a result, the government starts heavily subsidizing the remaining nomads to prevent further flight to the oil towns (and all that that brings with it), leading to the evolution of a nomadic lifestyle of luxurious RVs and shopping and entertainment brought to them by motor caravans.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> When it was in power, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">the Third Reich</a> was regarded as this trope embodied, by British and Francophone sources on one side and by the educated classes of German society on the other. German society before the Nazis had been very classist, playing on conservatism, modesty, classical German culture, Catholic and Protestant religion, and established social relationships. The Nazis, however, disregarding the British proverb which said "it takes 3 years to build a ship, but 300 years to build a tradition", judged everything by power as the universal medicine. They could build advanced weapons and industrial machinery, motorways, modern architecture, and public TV stations, and for this reason they felt no obligation to listen to anyone else. They could afford to disregard entirely the evolution of culture and arts before them, and throw anything not suited to their ideology into the garbage as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art">"degenerate and Jewish art"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <br/><br/>There was no surprise in the fact they were hated for it and treated like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">primitives suddenly endowed</a> with power and technology. The <em>nouveau riche</em> attitude of the political leadership, with men like Robert Ley, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Weber_%28SS_general%29">Christian Weber<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and Hermann Goering ruling their departments and flaunting their wealth like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">Mafia bosses</a>, only made things worse. In more practical terms, the Nazis took the same attitude to Jewish scientists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a> and rejected their research in favor of promoting hare-brained ideas in physics and other fields simply because non-Jewish Germans came up with them. Among the results of that bigotry were that many of those scientists fled to nations like Britain and the United States, which gave them the advantage of the skilled personnel needed to develop nuclear weapons. The ones remaining were <em>forbidden</em> to utilize Jewish scientists' work too.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1erxt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1erxt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1erxt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The (few) top-tier physicists remaining in Germany capable of designing atomic weapons (Heisenberg, for example) had no intention of doing so for the Nazis; several of them even managed to get themselves put in charge of atomic research specifically so that they could make sure nothing practical ever came of it. What <em>did</em> come out of it, but thankfully never actually used, would be something we call a "Dirty bomb", which is essentially putting nuclear material and copious amounts of explosives together, then detonating the contraption to spread nuclear pollution over a very wide area.</span>
</li><li> Global commerce can cause this too, resulting in places like Nigeria, where <em>there are more people with cell phones than people with mains power</em> — they rely on charging stations for rent on street markets and wi-fi password hacking.
</li><li> Also kind of a hobby of most of the major powers in the Cold War, who were arming their various Third World allies with ultra-modern weaponry in an effort to stymie the other side. Of course, after the Cold War ended most of those alliances fell apart, leaving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">lot of guns in some rather questionable hands</a>.
</li><li> Political scientist Basam Tibi termed the desire of fundamentalist organizations or societies to gain access to sophisticated technology (especially weaponry) while totally avoiding any social modernization whatsoever "the dream of incomplete modernity".
</li><li> The idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">humanity in general</a> is Low Culture, High Tech is a common thread of many primitivist and anti-industrial thinkers.
<ul><li> This was a key part of the ideology of Ted Kaczynski, the infamous Unabomber. In his manifesto, he alleged that the behaviors and social organization needed to run a modern industrial society clashed with basic human instincts written by thousands of years of natural selection, producing most of the social ills of the modern world in the process. Therefore, he felt that humanity was biologically unsuited to any mode of organization and technology more advanced than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">hunter-gatherers</a>, and used this as justification to launch a terrorist campaign aimed at airlines, universities, and industrial and high-tech concerns.
</li></ul></li><li> Let's just say, this trope + modern <em>weaponry</em> = Very Bad Things. Most horrible example ever? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a></em>, with armies still operating on what are essentially Napolean-era battle plans. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Charging against the enemy on an open field</a> when they have machine guns that can mow down people in seconds? The main reason why the war came to a standstill, with everyone just waiting in trenches — it was only until armored motor vehicles were invented that the armies could finally punch through trench defenses.
<ul><li> Also partly why the Nazis were able to take Poland and France so quickly during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a></em>. The forts and other defences were never designed to consider air bombardment.
</li></ul></li><li> Korean (and to a lesser extent, Chinese and Japanese) culture can be considered this when it comes to aviation, with the highly hierarchical "respect your elders" Confucian-influenced culture being in some cases <em>lethal</em> in airplanes. The co-pilot has to double check everything the captain does and vice versa, yet co-pilots often are afraid to correct their captain's mistakes, as the captain is their elder. This has actually led to <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Cargo_Flight_8509">crashes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. Korean Air has acknowledged this and is attempting to fix the problem with new pilot training.
<ul><li> American ex-military junior pilots sometimes also have this problem. They are among the best in the world technically, but they can occasionally fall back on their conditioning to respect a chain of command.
</li><li> Conversely it's sometimes said that the safest co-pilot to have in the cockpit is an Australian, because they are culturally least likely to recognise <em>any</em> hierarchy except that of professional competence, and are thus more likely than any other nationality to tell an erroneous captain what he's doing wrong.
</li><li> This was likely the cause behind the horrific double-Jumbo crash in Tenerife in the 1970s, still the worst in aviation history. The captain responsible was THE public face of KLM as well as being one of the senior flight instructors, and he seems to have bullied the co-pilot (whose job hung in part on his captain's approval) into accepting an airways clearance as a takeoff clearance (when the airport was bedecked in fog and a Pan Am 747 was taxiing up the runway, unseen, in front of him). The rest is history.
</li></ul></li><li> The internet. Especially when in the midst of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a>. Lampshaded <a class="urllink" href="http://www.flamewarriorsguide.com/warriorshtm/howlers.htm">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> What happens when traditional "sons, not daughters" societies as in the Middle East, India and China gain access to prenatal gender testing and abortion? Despite laws actively trying to prevent it, the birth ratio is as skewed as 100 male to 90 female newborns in some places. If there were no laws against it, the ratio would probably be even worse. China, in particular, struggles with these technologies as there is now a whole industry built around human trafficking and forced marriage.
</li><li> This is in some ways how Karl Marx defined capitalism. Humanity has developed to universally fulfill needs, but the culture, government, and organization of society had not caught up to the sheer ability to produce and provide for those needs in spite of that. So a revolutionary change must be made in order to bring human society up to the standards that technology and industry make possible. Whether he was right or not is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">still under debate</a>: though the biggest trial of communism in real life, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">Soviet Union</a></em>, failed very, very badly, Marx never considered Russia to be a valid location for the revolution, as it lacked the necessary industry for it to be ready - essentially, communism was an idea to be executed post-capitalism a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>.
</li><li> The fundamentalist terrorist group Islamic State (aka ISIS/ISIL/whatever) has access to modern weaponry (assault rifles, missile launchers, explosives, even some stolen tanks), yet their beliefs in regards to women's rights, LGBT rights, science, etc. are straight out of the Dark Ages, as they take a very, <strong>very</strong> literal reading of the Quran (which results in most of the victims of their reign of terror being other Muslims with more moderate views, since to ISIS, these folks are just doing it wrong). Reality has also ensued when it comes to how their society worked: children in schools weren't taught math or science, and while their fanaticism and sheer numbers gave them an explosive head start against the fractured and poorly motivated Iraqi Army, all that momentum was lost when the West stepped in, bombarded them from the air, and the Iraqis got their act together; they've now been beaten back out of nearly all of their territory, and are currently on the verge of collapse. A big part of this is that they genuinely believed they were starting the last war, and the world only had a few years before the final apocalyptic battle at Dabiq where Allah would step in and defeat their enemies for them; there simply wasn't any <em>point</em> in planning for the long term.
</li><li> India has a space program and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirdEyeOfBharat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirdEyeOfBharat">nuclear power</a>. Yet, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/63-million-indians-without-clean-drinking-water-population-of-australiaswedensri-lankabulgaria-13088">63 million<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of its people don't have access to clean drinking water and <a class="urllink" href="https://thewire.in/197455/732-million-india-tops-list-number-people-without-access-toilets-report/">732 million people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> don't have access to toilets.
<ul><li> On that note, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17362837">more people have cell phones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> than indoor toilets.
