Whether this also happened is debatable. Diogenes was more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a>. He prescribed masturbation to prevent sexual immorality, then <em>demonstrated.</em>

Several of the admirals are... eccentric. Sometimes they have crazy ideas that their saner subordinates shoot down; sometimes they have crazy brilliant ideas that pan out. (Or that were good, but don't pan out anyway.) This resonates with a culture of snark, where one suspects they're trying to see how much insanity they can get away with before someone cracks. Bebaus brothers, especially. The Abh even believe that "genius" and "insanity" are two sides of the same coin, and that any genius must by definition be somewhat insane.

</li><li> Perhaps best demonstrated with Chiyo, who's laughing like a loon the first time we meet her and her elderly brother, and attempting to attack Kakashi as soon as she meets him. She's crazy powerful, though. Naruto sums it up, "She may be old, but she's good."

Except he might be. Except he probably isn't. Lampshaded in-universe: the characters themselves are completely baffled over where his obfuscating insanity ends and either genuine senility or great wisdom begins. It's very noticeable, however, that he always plays up the insanity whenever he needs to get Inuyasha or Sesshoumaru to do something they don't want to do yet the insanity vanishes completely whenever he needs to explain the detail of a lesson they've just learned. Toutousai's ability to switch between this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">Let's Get Dangerous!</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> in a completely unpredictable manner may be the only thing that's kept him safe from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> that both brothers possess.

Note that she only came to the conclusion after reading a few pages on Multiple Personality Disorder in a book. Later on it's implied she did have mental health problems however she fits the trope properly, as she still pretends to be delusional and oblivious after she "snapped" out of it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>. It should be emphasized that just how <em>much</em> of the Joker's madness is genuine or part of a ploy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">largely depends on the writer</a>, naturally. He is quite, <em>quite</em> mad, but whether he's an out-and-out loony or just a very driven psychopath with a twisted sense of humour changes from story to story.
<ul><li> There was a particular story ("Case Study" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulDini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulDini">Paul Dini</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexRoss">Alex Ross</a>, from the anthology series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanBlackAndWhite">Batman Black and White</a></em>) that really explored this facet. The story was told from the perspective of two psychiatrists at Arkham, who had found a psychiatric analysis of Joker that revealed him as entirely sane, but faking insanity to cover his meticulous plans and get into mental institutions where it would be easier to break free. Hopeful that they can use this to get Joker transferred to a prison, they're disappointed to find out that the person who wrote the analysis was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harleen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter">Quinzel</a></em>, from before she went insane.</span>
</li><li> Oddly, this changing personality is <em>also</em> something that exists in-story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as noted by the very same Dr. Quinzel,</span> after being driven mad. She theorized that he reinvents his personality on a day-to-day basis, so that one day he may be a funny guy with a penchant for stalking the Bat, then the next he's a monster, then the next he's a glibbering loon. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her madness shows in her conclusion that the only constant is his love for her.</span>
</li><li> This theory is also put forth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a></em> by Ruth Adams who describes it as a form of Super Sanity that may be more suited to the end of the 21st century than the here and now. Her theory implies that the Joker might not have that much control over his reinventions; he might be able to choose his different personalities, but he can't help the irresistible impulse to change it in the first place, since it is essentially a coping mechanism to deal with the insanity of the world at large. In the above, however, Joker would be closer to a variation of Histrionic Personality Disorder- i.e. he is acting up for attention (also, he is a sadistic narcissistic sociopath, but that has nothing to do with why he changes personas, only why each persona is always a violent criminal). It should also be considered that Dr Ruth Adams may be a quack, especially if she thinks it constitutes <em>Super</em>-Sanity (which is an oxymoron) rather than some kind of dissociative disorder.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Jason Todd</a> once said to the Joker's face that acting so completely insane makes it easier for him to justify his actions. That wiped the smile right off the clown's face.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> also uses this trope to its full advantage, confusing and exhausting his enemies and allies alike with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkativeLoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkativeLoon">unstoppable mouth and wacky babbling</a>. Like the Joker, Deadpool really is insane (a different kind of insane, though) and knows it, but he plays up and (possibly) exaggerates his insanity for tactical benefit. Also like the Joker, the fact that his personality changes regularly is part of canon. In his case, his healing factor and cancer have combined to leave his braincells constantly in flux. In some stories he's little more than an immature goofball, others he's perfectly capable of committing murders in cold blood that he doesn't even remember afterward. Of course, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy">Meta Guy</a>, Deadpool's also the first to admit that the <em>real</em> reason he changes is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">who is writing him at the moment</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Groucho Marx</a>, Lord Julius, is a sterling example of this. Cerebus explains it during a croquet game with someone else: "Insanity is the last defense of the master bureaucrat, but you have to lay the foundation early in the game.

For instance, when confronting Harvey, he claims he's "a dog chasing cars" and didn't really have any animosity towards Dent in specific, when later on he admits to being <em>entirely</em> aware of the impact and meaning of driving Dent to madness. There's also countless points in the movie that involve him having planted the seeds of long-term plans (particularly explosives). In general, he is psychotic, but he's still highly intelligent and entirely capable of long-term plans - he just wants people to think he's completely random because it makes them dismiss him as a foolish thug. (Considering his overall motivations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">this is pretty ironic.</a>)

<ul><li> Murdock was eccentric and likely did suffer from some form of PTSD, but was definitely (maybe) not mad. His team had to break him out of a mental institution in almost every episode. However, at times he faked more extreme insanity to get <em>into</em> an asylum in order to break someone else out, or take down a gun smuggling ring or something. Of course, he might have exaggerated the problem more regularly for the free accommodation and the nurses, or just to irritate B.A. When the situation called for it, Murdock could act completely sane(-ish) and coldly competent.
</li><li> In one episode, his psychiatrist even calls him out on it that he knows Murdock is sane and simply putting on a VERY good act. Faking insanity not only gave him free room and board at the VA, but also could be a safeguard against any criminal charges.

When the King of Gath recognizes him as an anti-Philistine guerrilla warrior, David pretended to be a raving madman, causing the king to think him harmless.
</li><li> Several Hebrew prophets were instructed by God to act in seemingly crazy ways to illustrate various parables. Isaiah walked barefoot and half-naked for three years to symbolize the Israelites' coming captivity; Ezekiel lay on a stone to represent the captivity of Jerusalem; Hosea married a prostitute to symbolize God's love for faithless Israel.
</li><li> In the New Testament <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfCorinthians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfCorinthians">Book of Corinthians</a></em>, the apostle Paul mentions "foolishness for Christ" on several occasions:

They are known to go around half-naked, homeless, and speaking in riddles, often acting wild and disruptive, and only doing charity or working miracles out of public view. Similarly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester">The Jester</a>, their feigned insanity can also let them get away with making social commentary that would get other people in trouble.

<ul><li> One story tells of a monk who tells his abbott that he would like to become a Holy Fool, but by this time enough people know that Holy Fools are only feigning their insanity, so they look down on them as self-righteous fakers. The abbott ponders this and then advises the monk to go ahead and become a Holy Fool anyway, since being condemned as a self-righteous faker when you're not is just as good a way to cultivate humility.

He developed his "Loose Cannon" gimmick of behaving incredibly erratically, not just at shows, but everywhere he could, to make people genuinely believe he was a nut, in order to get WCW, the company he was working for, to "fire him for real" (as in, send him a real release for a fake firing), which he immediately signed and jumped ship. As his body was deteriorating, particularly his ankle due to a car crash in 1996, it was a way to keep himself on TV in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> without him having to wrestle. Before his death, he only let a handful of people he truly respected in on how deep into character he was, and not actually insane.

</li><li> Hamlet's predecessor Amlaeth is much less ambiguous, largely because the Norse audience of the saga were fully aware that the insane were regarded with superstitious respect and nobody dared kill them and had no problem with a man on a quest for revenge succeeding in his plan and living happily ever after. Shakespeare either did not understand why Amlaeth's plan actually is a clever way to avoid being killed and needed to rewrite the ending into a tragedy, and so wrote Hamlet as much more of an erratic idiot, or understood perfectly well, but understood that for an audience that did not have a superstitious dread of the insane, the story would be much more powerful and affecting if it were more ambiguous as to whether Hamlet were insane.

Vaas explains in a rather eloquent fashion that insanity is defined as repetitious cycles of behavior done with the expectation that a different result will come from it. When he first heard that he thought it was "bullshit" and even shot the guy who told him that. Actually taking time to look at people around him, Vaas realized that insanity is the norm for humanity because people really do have everyday moments of insanity that they don't even realize that they commit, so in actual fact Obfuscating Sanity is the fake persona because deep down everyone is insane in some way. A major theme of the story is the idea that men being left to their own devices without civilization to bog them down will become immoral animals and do whatever they want. This is explicitly pointed out by the developers that Vaas is supposed to unsettle us because it makes us wonder if it's true that we might become something vile like him if we were left to our devices.

His own family even insisted he had a low IQ, and that he suffered from various mental disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia and psychosis, while psychiatrists testified he was medically unfit to stand trial. But this "crazy" stunt eventually came back to bite him in 1997, when mobsters from other families testified that Gigante's "insanity" was actually an elaborate ruse to prevent law enforcement from going after him, and in 2003, he finally admitted to intentionally misleading numerous psychiatrists and investigators over the years by faking his insanity. Gigante later died in prison while doing a 12-year stint for racketeering and murder charges in 2005.

<ul><li> He allegedly wrote up false reports of himself being a child murderer and other horrible things, then sent them to magazines under a fake name so people would think he's insane and won't approach him if they encounter him in public. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a>, on the other hand, thinks that Alan is doing this <em>all the time</em>.
</li><li> And then there was Alan's 50th birthday where, instead of boring his friends by going through a midlife crisis, Alan decided to go completely mad and declare himself to be a <em>magician</em>. He still refers to himself as one and is introduced as one in interviews. It helps his case that he believes art to be synonymous with magic, and as an artist, he really is performing magic by telling stories.
</li><li> In one interview, Alan Moore explained how he flatly rejected boatloads of cash offered by Hollywood to make more big screen adaptations of his stories with his name in the writing credits. This actually worried the execs because, as Moore put it: "How can this guy not want money!? What <strong>does</strong> he want??".
</li></ul></li><li> The first woman reporter, Nellie Bly, pretended to be crazy so she could get committed and write about lunatic asylums from the inside. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">It worked too well</a>; when she wanted to leave, she couldn't convince the doctors she was sane, so her editor had to come in with a couple of lawyers. She wrote about brutality, beatings, unsanitary conditions, ice cold baths, lousy food and all the ways that the inmates were denied any sense of self-respect or humanity. <a class="urllink" href="http://librivox.org/ten-days-in-a-madhouse-by-nellie-bly/">The book she wrote is still in print<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Psychiatrists and students tried to do what Nellie did almost 100 years later. Like her they had no trouble getting in, though leaving was less of a problem. It's partly the reason the DSM-III (<em>Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> edition III) was introduced. There's a lot of stuff in that book that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/05/the-real-problems-with-psychiatry/275371/">reformers argue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is normal behavior that has been designated as crazy so insurance companies would pay off. Every edition is bigger and more complex. Currently, they're up to version V. Some of the editors for the DSM-V have come out with concerns that the DSM-V diagnoses relatively normal behaviour as well. It has gotten so nutty in the "bureau of who's sane and who isn't" that many <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23487-psychiatry-divided-as-mental-health-bible-denounced.html">respected psychiatric organizations have officially abandoned the DSM<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> As a note, the people involved with this were treated rather humanely, unlike the first, but it took them six weeks or so to get let out. This is also used as an example of why anyone studying psychiatry shouldn't be arrogant.
</li><li> Furthermore, the staff at the hospitals never noticed that the "patients" were phonies...but the other patients saw right through them.

</li><li> World War I pilots sometimes used a technique called "jinxing" — flying like you have no idea what you're doing. In addition to any possible psychological edge it offered, jinxing made you unpredictable and thus harder to shoot down. This caught on to such a degree, it evolved into the concept of jinking, a series of quick, evasive dodges and turns specifically designed to avoid gunfire.
</li><li> A Soviet man avoided being drafted to fight in Afghanistan by studying textbooks on mental illness, and then faking it. It worked, but in a textbook case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a> he wound up feeling crazy in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse">Soviet mental hospital</a>. He eventually wrote a memoir about it, <em>Teach Yourself Madness</em>.
</li><li> It's possible that Libya's former dictatorial leader, Moammar Gaddafi, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/22/AR2011022207257.html">was doing this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> He was known to behave very bizarrely and might also have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, but Wikileaks cables reveal that he was quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>, playing off any number of rivals, subordinates, and his own family members against each other. Nothing prevents him from having been both completely nuts, yet still politically savvy. He wouldn't have been the first ruler to combine the two traits.
</li><li> In 1200, the English village of Gotham (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">not that one</a>) in Nottinghamshire learned that King John wanted to build a hunting lodge nearby. This meant that the road through the village would be a royal highway, which would mean anyone travelling on it would have to pay more tolls and taxes. So the entire village pretended to be mad, by attempting to imprison a cuckoo by building a fence round its tree, drowning an eel, and trying to rake the moon out of the village pond. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the fact that in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges">Middle Ages</a>, insanity was believed to be contagious, and therefore a) the idea of an entire village going mad was perfectly believable and b) no-one in their right mind would go anywhere near the place. The hunting lodge was never built.
</li><li> Similarly, during Queen Elizabeth the First's trip around England, one household feigned madness en masse in an attempt to avoid the large price of hosting the Queen. It worked.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> called this the Madman theory: "I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, "for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when he's angryand he has his hand on the nuclear button" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace." How effective the tactic was is debatable. The North Vietnamese did eventually make a peace deal acceptable to the Nixon administration in 1972 (3 years after Ho Chi Minh's death), albeit probably for more complex reasons than just this. The deal itself is much more favorable to the Vietnamese.
<ul><li> Nixon based this on his experience as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightEisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s Vice President. Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, which many argue forced China and North Korea to the negotiating table. The reality's a bit more complicated, but Nixon certainly believed it.

He was too inexperienced at the time to realise he was being conned, until the junkie's stream of gibberish was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">interrupted by the sight of an attractive blonde lawyer bending over to pick up her pen</a>, whereupon the junkie exclaimed: "Gawd, can I have her defending me?"
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a>'s opponents spent time in prison, and Ali exploited the fears he'd picked up during his stint by pretending to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.
</li><li> The Medieval Arab scholar Alhazen was invited to Cairo by the Caliph al-Hakim in order to realize a project to regulate the flooding of the Nile. Upon arriving in Egypt, Alhazen quickly discovered that A) he had vastly underestimated the scope of the task,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1tqf3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1tqf3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1tqf3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> perhaps he had been in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">denial</a> </span> which was completely impossible; and B) al-Hakim was not a man who took kindly to disappointment. According to legend, Alhazen got out of this predicament by pretending to be insane for <em>eleven years</em> until al-Hakim died in 1021.
