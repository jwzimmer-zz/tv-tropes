<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NaruTaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NaruTaru">Naru Taru</a></em>, there is Shiina, whose name means "a husk" or "a seed that will never flower". For this reason, Shiina always writes her name in katakana, which, unlike the original Chinese characters, don't carry explicit meaning. The name is questioned by other characters throughout the series. It is later revealed that her mother gave her that name because she didn't want Shiina to grow up and leave her as her other daughter did.

In English, they named their kid <em>Emperor of Dragon's Peak</em>. This, of course, made him the target of endless jokes and taunting through the majority of his childhood, and nearly everyone feels the need to comment on just how pretentious his name sounds when they meet him.
</li><li> Izaya (effectively named after the biblical prophet Isaiah) expresses similar sentiments about his name.
<div class="indent"><strong>Izaya:</strong> My parents are completely ordinary people. Except for when it comes to the taste in children's names, that is.

Intensely depressed protagonist Nozomu's family name of Itoshiki is made up of two kanji that, when written too closely together and combined with the kanji for his first name, look an awful lot like the word "despair". The other members of his family are all shown to have similarly easily-mistaken names as well, such as his Doctor brother whose name can be written as "Death". Better yet, it's heavily implied that the family patriarch does this with the sole reason that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">amuses</a> him!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a>,</em> the thirteenth child of the Ran clan is named Jyuusanhime, which just means "thirteenth princess." She's shown complaining about it in a flashback to her childhood friend Shiba Jin, who responds by giving her the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a> Hotaru ("firefly").
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>, King Gale Raregroove had...questionable taste in baby names. King's first son got the name Lucia, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Gender-Blender Name</a> that means light — which would be an unremarkable detail if his son hadn't grown up to be the embodiment of evil with a dark-themed power. His stepbrother did not have it much easier, being named Deep Snow for how much it was snowing outside at the time of his adoption.

And to make things worse, his village's laws say that only the godfather can choose a child's name, hence Pantyhose coming to Japan to try and have him change his name to Handsome Taro (never mind that everyone else finds it <em>worse</em> - if he's happy and will take Happousai away, then they aren't going to be pointing that out).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> does this when the announcer at the World Martial Arts Tournament asks Android 18 if "Number Eighteen" is her real name. In the original, she says it doesn't matter, but in the English dub, she snarks that "My father was pretty dull." Though this was debunked entirely with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Toriyama's</a> reveal that "Android 18" really <em>is</em> just a title. Her real name is Lazuli.

<ul><li> After telling the hero her name, Adora Belle Dearheart from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em> adds that as a result, "I have no sense of humour whatsoever." (Her childhood nickname was "Killer".) Some jokes are also made about the main character's first name: Moist. Who names their kid Moist? Apparently "doting if unwise parents." In combination with his surname, "von Lipwig", it could qualify as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>. "He was not going to embarrass the name, insofar as that was still possible..."
</li><li> The siblings from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather">Hogfather</a></em>, Twyla and Gawain. Death himself remarked that the latter name if chosen because it sounded like a good name for a fighter, was most likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>.
</li><li> The "Guards" series of books have a character named "Carrot." According to his adoptive dwarf parents (he's a human), he was named for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild">shape</a>, not the color of his hair, which happens to be red. Carrot's dwarf name translates as "Head Banger". He's six feet tall and grew up in a dwarf-scale mine.
</li><li> Also in the "Guards" series is a dwarf named "Cheery Littlebottom." This is made worse by the fact that male and female dwarfs look exactly alike, so in theory, this was meant to be a gender-neutral name (Cheery happens to be female). The character is also acutely aware of how ridiculous her name is. Vimes, upon being introduced, remarks that Cheery's parents must have been "traditionalists", so apparently naming your children after emotional states (e.g. Happy, Bashful, Grumpy...) is traditional there.
</li><li> In the same scene, Cheery mentions that her father's name is Jolly, so presumably it runs in the family.
</li><li> And then there's Corporal Nobby Nobbs, whose full name is 'Cecil Wormsborough St. John Nobbs'. A name made all the more astonishing given that Nobby's family are as working class as it gets, and lived in a particularly rough part of the city. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">It becomes more understandable</a> if you know that his great-grandfather was <em>possibly</em> the illegitimate son of an Earl.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">The book where we find out about both the above</a> also reveals that Sam Vimes had a very famous ancestor (basically an expy of Oliver Cromwell) whose name was "Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes". Small wonder he ended up nicknamed "Old Stoneface".
</li><li> And then there's Constable Visit, whose full name is 'Visit-the-Infidel-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets'. His fellow Omnians have a tendency towards similarly lengthy and religious names. This is based on traditional Puritan naming. In former days when the Omnians were rather more <em>robust</em> in their methods of propagating their religion, the equivalent name was something more like "Visit-the-infidel-with-fire-and-sword". The name of Constable Smite-the-unbeliever-with-cunning-arguments appears to have undergone a similar evolution.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies">Lords and Ladies</a></em>, the Carter family of Lancre was under the delusion that, if you name daughters after virtues (Charity, Temperance, and so forth), you name <em>sons</em> after <em>vices</em>. Ironically, both the sons and the daughters are the exact opposite of their names—Chastity Carter is a "lady of negotiable affection" and Bestiality Carter is very kind to animals.
</li><li> Magrat Garlick is called that due to an unfortunate christening ceremony. Her attempt to avoid this with her own daughter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em> results in said daughter being named Princess Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling of Lancre. The same book also mentions the unfortunate cases of James What-The-Hell's-That-Cow-Doing-In-Here Poorchick (his friends call him "Moocow") and King My God He's Heavy the First. A footnote explains that these people got off <em>lightly</em>. Lancre folk, being uncomplicated as they are, tend to name their kids with whatever sounds good to them, leading to one poor unfortunate sod named "Total Biscuit", and a recounting of one kid just narrowly missing being called <em>Chlamydia</em> because her mother didn't know how to spell it.
</li><li> All the Lancre examples involve the local custom that your name is whatever the priest performing the naming ceremony says when they get to the part where they're supposed to say the child's name, and there's no shifting it afterwards (unless you leave Lancre and don't come back, as many do).
</li><li> There's also One Man Bucket from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan">Reaper Man</a></em>, short for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">One Man Pouring a Bucket of Water Over Two Dogs</a>, named according to his culture's custom of naming children after the first thing the mother sees after giving birth. He has an older twin brother whose name is... well, let's just say "he would have given his right arm to be called Two Dogs <em>Fighting</em>."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> has a minor character named Legitimate First ("Leggy" to his friends). Fred Colon's only word of explanation for the name: "Can't blame a mother for being proud, Nobby."
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em>, Mr. A. E. Pessimal. Who wasn't named at birth, he was initialed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWeeFreeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWeeFreeMen">The Wee Free Men</a></em>, there's a boy named Punctuality Riddle (his parents had heard about naming children after virtues, and decided this was the virtue they most wanted their child to have). And an old woman named Miss Female Infant Robinson, whose mother saw the midwife note the delivery of "female infant" and assumed that was the child's name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic">Soul Music</a></em>, Susan Sto Helit briefly regards her name as an example of learning who her grandfather is. Susan is a very <em>ordinary</em> name, and not really appropriate for someone's who is the granddaughter of Death. She should have a name with lots of xs and zs in it.
</li></ul></li><li> A character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em> was secretly named Major Major Major by his father, who kept the fact from his mother.

</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CallahansCrosstimeSaloon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CallahansCrosstimeSaloon">Callahan's Place</a></em> books, there's a mention of a couple who were both afflicted with punny names by their parents, and decided to swap surnames when they married. Those original names: Les Moore and Merry Glueham (pronounced "gloom"). They now enjoy being Merry Moore and Les Glueham. There's also passing mention of the child of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fans named Lahey and Hu, and the report that little three-year-old Yoda Lahey-Hu has already learned how to fight dirty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne's House of Dreams</a></em>, Miss Cornelia comments approvingly on Anne's choice of baby name (James Matthew), and mentions in passing that another new mother in the neighborhood has decided to call her baby Bertie Shakespeare. He becomes a common fixture in subsequent stories about Anne's children, and is never referred to by anything other than the whole thing: Bertie Shakespeare Drew.
<ul><li> Earlier books in the series feature Anne's classmate Moody Spurgeon McPherson, who is last heard of at college, studying to be a minister. "He couldn't be anything else with that name." (Moody and Spurgeon were two famous preachers.) Much as with the aforementioned Bertie Shakespeare, Moody Spurgeon is almost always referred to by his full name.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlongForTheRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlongForTheRide">Along for the Ride</a></em>, the protagonist's father pretentiously names his kids after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">"obscure"</a> references.

Bonnie Blue is implied to have been conceived during or after a performance of Gone with the Wind (and her father is... eccentric). The other two have no such explanation, and both wonder what their parents were thinking.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AcornaSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AcornaSeries">Acorna Series</a></em>, Acorna (who was named by a trio of human miners that adopted her when they found her escape pod floating near their ship) is called Khornya by her own race (as they have difficulty pronouncing Acorna), which incidentally means "One Horn" in Linyaari. Needless to say, many are amused and bemused by her name.
</li><li> The main character of <em>The Dog Lover's Mysteries</em> is named Holly Winter. She claims it's because her parents didn't want her to feel "different" from her siblings. Her parents were dog breeders, and their other "children" were Golden Retrievers.
</li><li> The female protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenCycle">The Raven Cycle</a></em> is named Blue Sargent.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnVarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnVarley">John Varley</a>'s <em>Thunder And Lightning</em> series, Jubal (short for Jubilation) got off easy. His religious fanatic father named his brothers Veneration, Celebration, Sanctification, Exaltation, Consecration, and Hallelujah. His sisters are Gloria Patri, Gloria Fili, Gloria Spiritusanctu, Gloria Inexcelsis, and Gloria Monday. Hallelujah's name derives from his mother finding out she couldn't have any more children.
</li><li> Silence Montane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsForSilenceInTheForestsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsForSilenceInTheForestsOfHell">Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a>. The author's introduction states that he got the name of the protagonist from a Puritan in genealogical records, and he wondered what would cause parents to name their daughter "Silence" rather than other, more obvious virtues.
</li><li> A heartwarming variant occurs in Jonathan Tropper's <em>How to Talk to a Widower.</em> Doug's dead wife was named Hailey (making him the eponymous widower), and a year later, his twin sister Claire reveals she's pregnant. When Doug catches up to Claire's first ultrasound, even though it's too early to know what gender her child would be, she immediately tells Doug:

There is also a mention of a Blackberry Brown and a Bluesharp Babysplit.
</li><li> In the <em>Town of Silent Guns</em> by Rejtő Jenő, the main character is known by everyone as Bad Luck the 13th Pencroft (13. Pác Pencroft in the original Hungarian). The nickname comes from (unsurprisingly) his insane bad luck, which is the only thing holding back his otherwise very impressive burglary skills. strangely enough he doesn't seem to mind the nickname much, as his real first name is "Tivald"; which by his own description could only have come about by having his drunken father chop up the alphabet, and start pulling letters of it out of a hat before becoming bored.

He was named in memory of Turtle Heart, Melena's lover and a Quadling glassblower.
</li><li> Charlotte Macleod's humorous mystery novels about Sarah Kelling include Sarah's cousins Jesse, Woodson, and James. Sarah notes that her cousin Lionel's approach to child-raising is about what you'd expect from someone who would name his children, collectively, after a famous outlaw.

Some names are embarrassing because they're very obviously meant to convey their parents' political beliefs.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, it became particularly embarrassing to have a name like that, so Germany made a special exception to its otherwise strict name-change laws to allow these people to legally change their names to something less embarrassing. Despite this, a German website circa 2000 found several people who still had names like this, including two Adolf Hitlers and five Eva Brauns.

Song apparently did this in honor of his grandfather, who was an independence activist during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>'s rule over Korea.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Silly spellings</h3>
Some names are chosen because they're spelled a certain way or designed to look like something, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable">they can't be pronounced properly</a> or otherwise don't match what the kid's actually called.
<ul><li> A Swedish couple, in protest of the nation's law banning bizarre names, named their kid <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_law_in_Sweden#Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116">Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, pronounced "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeCallMeTim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeCallMeTim">Albin</a>". The courts blocked it, so they tried naming him "A" (still pronounced "Albin"). The courts blocked that one too.
</li><li> In 2002 a Russian couple in France tried to name their son "БОЧ рВФ 260602" — "Biological Object Human of the line of Voronins-Frolovs born 25.06.2002", and his father tried to change his own name in a similar way. Technically, the law does not forbid it, but registry office bureaucrats refused to issue a birth certificate with this name. Courts on several levels confirmed the decision of the registry office. and the Strasbourg court dropped the case without explanation. As of 2013 the boy still was officially nameless and without citizenship, but did get medical insurance and was attending a municipal public school. In private, his parents call him Boris.
</li><li> From 1990 to 2014, 328 girls in the U.S. have been named <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vocativ.com/culture/society/people-named-abcde/">Abcde<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, pronounced "Ab-city". The name made headlines in 2018 when a Southwest Airlines agent <a class="urllink" href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/mother-of-girl-called-abcde-vents-fury-at-airline-employee-who-laughed-at-her-name-a4004151.html">made fun of a girl with that name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Parents might not notice until it's too late that a name can be crafted into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Incredibly Lame Pun</a>, especially when combined with the last name.
<ul><li> A typical name can "disguise" a pun like this because it only works with a common nickname, like "Michael Hunt", "Richard Head", or "Raymond Pugh". If you Google those names, you'll find that multiple people own them. There's even an unfortunate soul called "Raymond Piast" on Facebook. Trying to explain that the Piasts are one of the noble families of Europe (some were even <em>Kings of Poland</em>!) doesn't mitigate the pun for this unfortunate gent...
<ul><li> Sometimes a nickname isn't even necessary, such as anyone unfortunate enough to be named "Hugh Jass."
</li></ul></li><li> Texas Governor Jim Hogg infamously named his daughter <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ima_Hogg#Name">Ima<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This spawned a lot of public jokes (the most famous being that she had a sister named Ura), and she never lived it down. Her father claimed that she was named after a character in a poem and that he wasn't consciously aware of how it sounded, but a lot of the more cynical Texans didn't believe him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ima_Hogg">article on Ima Hogg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tells us that her grandfather heard of her name, saw the obvious problem, and rushed in vain to stop the christening. Despite her embarrassing name, she became one of the most respected ladies in Texas, a famous philanthropist and patron of the arts, and known as "The First Lady of Texas."
</li><li> The city of Fort Wayne, Indiana stopped naming things after former mayor <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Baals">Harry Baals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> once they figured out what his name sounded like. Perhaps they were tipped off when people kept stealing the street sign for "Harry Baals Drive".
</li><li> A woman on Yahoo Answers asked if her son Manerd might have a problem because he poops in a corner. Commenters suggested that his problem is that his mother named him Manerd.

Less attention was paid to the announcement (as many people saw the delay coming) and more towards the name of the IOC member, to the point where it was the #8 trending term on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>. His name? <em>Dick Pound</em>.

Because nothing says "embarrassing fanboy" <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/01/baby-names-fiction-are-high-stakes/605650/">quite like naming your kid like this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:

He got the likes, and he did (in spite of his wife's wishes), and more strangely, it was approved (in spite of Portugal's strict laws designed to prevent names like this). The page is still active, in case he wants to name his next kid after another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> inspired many parents to name children after characters from the show. "Daenerys" and "Khaleesi" <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-parents-daenerys-name.html">became a point of contention<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the show's last two episodes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where said character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">goes nuts</a>, burns down a city after it surrendered, and threatens to take over the kingdom of Westeros as a despot before she is killed</span>.
</li><li> Sometimes, it's the creator themselves who will encourage this:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Acclaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Acclaim">Acclaim</a> offered to pay $10,000 to whoever named their child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Turok">Turok</a>.

</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw">There Should Be a Law</a></h3>
Some countries have laws that are designed to prevent names like this, with varying levels of success:
<ul><li> Iceland requires names to be approved by an official naming committee, which can reject a name for being embarrassing. However, the main reason for the committee is the preservation of the Icelandic language — they can reject any name that is not Icelandic enough or which cannot be properly spelled or inflected in Icelandic. A high-profile case involved an Icelandic mother and British father whose kids Harriet and Duncan had to change their names if they were going to keep their Icelandic passports, entirely for linguistic reasons. Similarly, Mayor of Reykjavík Jón Gnarr fought the naming committee for years to keep his <em>last</em> name — proper Icelandic last names are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmXSonOfY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmXSonOfY">patronymics</a>, and Gnarr is estranged from his father and wanted to keep his distance. For what it's worth, many Icelanders think the law is too strict, and the government is starting to ease up on this — in both these cases, everyone was eventually allowed to keep their names.
</li><li> In Japan, all characters in a given name must come from a list of pre-approved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseWritingSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseWritingSystem">kanji</a>. Part of this is practical — there are many thousands of kanji, and an obscure character can break databases. But part of this is also to prevent embarrassing or vulgar characters from being part of a given name. Parents have applied (unsuccessfully) to name their kids with characters meaning, in whole or in part, "cancer", "haemorrhoid", "corpse", "excrement", "curse", "prostitute", and "rape". In 1993, a Japanese couple <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nistep.go.jp/achiev/ftx/eng/pol001e/html/pol001ee.html">found a loophole<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and successfully named their kid 悪魔 (<em>Akuma</em>, meaning "devil") with two approved characters. Then the government caught up with them and the Family Court ruled that naming a child "Akuma" was an abuse of rights — but since the name had been previously accepted, only the parents had the power to change the child's name. And they did, under private and public pressure — to 亜駆 (<em>Aku</em>, roughly "sub-impel"). In any event, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading">Alternate Character Reading</a> means these names can still be <em>pronounced</em> any way you like, which is how you get names like <a class="urllink" href="https://kotaku.com/parents-please-dont-name-your-kid-pikachu-5963198">Pikachu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — these names are known as "<em>kirakira</em> names" ("shiny names") or "<em>dokyun</em> names" ("idiot names").
<ul><li> A case of how bad a kirakira name could have on the person involved: In 2019, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/03/12/national/japanese-teens-post-name-change-goes-viral-twitter-sparks-conversation-unusual-names/">there was a viral story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about a high school boy who got fed up of his name at birth, Ojisama (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">Lord</a> Prince). It's not only about bullying, but actual <em>confusion</em>, since his name is usually a title, so many people read his name to mean "Lord Prince [family name]". He spent several years on how to get a court order for a name change—notoriously difficult in Japan—and petitioned for one when he reached 18. His new name? Hajime.
</li></ul></li><li> China similarly has a list of pre-approved characters that can be used for names (after all, kanji are basically just Chinese characters). But since Chinese has many spoken dialects using a single writing system, the character list can still be abused to make embarrassing puns or homonyms — even accidentally, at least when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMyLanguageThatSoundsLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMyLanguageThatSoundsLike">going from one language to another</a>.
</li><li> In Italy, not only could birth registrars refuse a sufficiently ridiculous name, but historically they could also unilaterally assign a replacement name (usually the name of the saint of the kid's birthday). Nowadays, the registrar has to write the parents' preferred name down, but will also warn them that they're breaking the law and turn them over to the authorities; one couple went all the way up Italy's highest court, the Corte di Cassazione — and lost — in an attempt to name their kid <em>"Venerdì"</em> ("Friday"). In this case, the lawmakers weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> — they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">just knew their countrymen</a>, who since the time of ancient Rome have never backed down from mocking anything remotely funny.
<ul><li> Similar laws are on the books in many European countries, originating in France with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">revolutionary laws</a> to keep someone's name the same they were given at birth and later perfected when the lawmakers saw what names parents would give to their children (the above mentioned law has specific exceptions for names that are objectively embarrassing but passed the registrar anyway for some reason).
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Court intervention</h3>
In some cases, even when there isn't a law about stupid names, individual courts may determine that a name is ridiculous and order it changed:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2196204/">This article from Slate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mentions a child named "Talula Does the Hula from Hawaii", a name sufficiently embarrassing that it was considered child abuse, and she was made a ward of the court so that she could change her name.
</li><li> A New Zealand couple tried to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1559705/This-babys-name-is-not-4Real-couple-told.html">name their kid "4Real"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but the courts blocked it — not necessarily because it was stupid, but because it contained a numeral. The parents named the kid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> instead, but said they're still going to call him 4Real.
</li><li> A controversial case from Tennessee saw a judge <a class="urllink" href="http://www.afro.com/sections/news/afro_briefs/story.htm?storyid=79453">block a couple from naming their kid "Messiah"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The only problem was that it wasn't because it was unusual, but because only Jesus could be called "Messiah". Not only were the parents not happy, but neither was the American Civil Liberties Union. It's not even a <em>correct</em> religious justification, as "Messiah" is a title literally meaning "anointed one", and it was not exclusive to divine beings or indeed any one person; historically, it was a title of the kings of Judah and was even given in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> itself</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat">Cyrus the Great</a> (for allowing the Jews to return to Israel and rebuild the Temple after the Babylonian Captivity and generally being a good ruler). The decision was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parents-can-name-their-baby-messiah-after-all-tenn-judge-rules/">later overturned<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tennessee-judge-who-vetoed-messiah-as-babys-name-is-fired/">official fired, apparently for violating judicial processes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grimes">Grimes</a> and Elon Musk have named their child <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/05/grimes-elon-musk-baby-announcement?intcid=inline_amp">X Æ A-12<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/grimes-changes-baby-name/">or rather<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> X Æ- A-Xii, given Californian law forbids using digits in names.
</li><li> A lot of the hippies in the 60s and early 70s would name their kids things like Aquarius or Moonglow or Starwalker.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> did this for all his children, naming them <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Zappa">Moon Unit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva. He wanted names that were pretty and evocative, and he wasn't worried about the weirdness because he figured their surname was going to get them into trouble more than anything else. In Dweezil's case, an exasperated nurse prevented Frank from legally naming him "Dweezil" (he opted for "Ian Donald Calvin Euclid", the names of several of his associates), but the family still called him Dweezil. Young Dweezil was quite distraught to discover that Dweezil wasn't his legal name, and he changed it at the first opportunity when he turned 18.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> named his son Zowie, meaning his full name is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime">Zowie Bowie</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Brazil has a tradition of weird names, usually with a foreign origin: homages (e.g. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Couto">Creedence Clearwater Couto<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), misspelled imports (Michael = Maicon, Maycon, Maikon, Maykon), or names that just try to sound different (most commonly ending in -son, such as Denilson, Valdson, Liedson and Nadson). Then there's names such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jcuberaba.com.br/userfiles/_Tospericargerja-Torres-(1).jpg">Tospericagerja<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, a homage to six players on the team that won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup">FIFA World Cup</a> in 1970 (Tostão, Pelé, Rivellino, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, and Jairzinho), and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odvan">Odvan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, homage to the song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlAx9_QD0oc">O<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divan_(furniture)">Divã<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".

</li><li> Mexico has all manner of bizarre names, some of which were banned after the fact, including the Spanish equivalents of Panties, Batman, Illuminated, Scrotum, Caesarean, Virgin, Private, Burger King, Robocop, US Navy, and Spinach. There's been some call to have a law regulating this formally, but political cartoonist Francisco "Paco" Calderon criticized this as foolish, noting how cyclical this trope is and once-ridiculous names can become commonplace (and vice versa). Some of the weirder popular ones are "Masiosare" (from a verse in the national anthem, <em>"mas si osare un extraño enemigo"</em>), and "Anivderev", which confused parents thought was the name of a saint celebrated on November 20th — it's actually short for <em>"Aniversario de la Revolucion"</em> ("Anniversary of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution">Revolution</a>"), but it's marked that way on calendars the same way saints are listed on their respective days.

</li><li> The short-lived Fred Allen game show <em>Judge for Yourself</em> once had a contestant named 5/8 Smith. Apparently, there were so many Smiths where he lived that they ran out of first names, or so he claimed. Allen had some fun with it:
<div class="indent"><strong>Allen:</strong> They got into the numerals, eh?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Allen:</strong> When your father was naming you 5/8, he must've been celebrating with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink">one fifth</a>.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Allen:</strong> You are probably the only man alive who can write his name on an adding machine.
</div></li><li> A pregnant woman cancelled her baby shower and made an angry rant directed at her friends and family for mocking her decision to name her baby "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/a43e0k/woman_cancels_babyshower_over_name/">Squire Sebastian Senator<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". She claimed that the name would represent her family's line of squires and senators. Fair enough, but what appears to have done her in is her insistence that he must <em>always</em> be referred to as "Squire Sebastian Senator" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">not any nickname</a>, which is what led to the online ridicule.
</li><li> Greek surnames tend to be <em>very</em> odd, with certain ones being similar or identical to the words "Goat", "Pig", "Big-head" (used to say someone is dumb), "<em>Grease</em>" and "<strong>Penis</strong>". There's also people who, <a class="urllink" href="http://users.ntua.gr/ge01033/onomatepwnuma.htm">due to an unfortunate name-surname combination<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, have name combination that either sound like or are identical to things like "Honest Perfect", "Harmless Albanian", "Vrasidas Vampire", "Aristomenis Whale", "Oil Crisis", "Sunday Afternoon", "Friday Afternoon", "March April" and "<strong>Chosen Goat</strong>".
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Others</h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> was seen as having an embarrassingly un-English name when she was the young heiress presumptive to the throne. In 1837, Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, desperately pleaded with the then-princess to take a more traditional English name like Elizabeth or Charlotte. It could have been worse; Victoria was her second name, and her first name was Alexandrina. In any event, she solved the problem by becoming the then-longest reigning monarch England had ever had and an enduring symbol of English culture; "Victoria" is now one of the most English names you can think of.
</li><li> Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla named his twin children Faustus and Fausta, choosing what was, at the time, an exceedingly rare and obscure <em>praenomen</em> in an era where most Roman men were named Lucius, Gaius, or Marcus (and most Roman women went without personal names and used a feminized form of the family names). In doing so, he revived the name's popularity for the rest of antiquity.
</li><li> If you want proof that standards for names have changed over time, look no further than the children of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>. In 1966, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> named his first son Zak (full name, not short for Zachariah or anything), the fans and media thought it was incredibly weird. Nowadays, it's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNaymeIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNaymeIs">fairly unusual spelling of an uncommon name</a>. By the late 1970s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> named his son Dhani, and no one batted an eyelash — if anything, they figured that it was an Indian name, and George had a well-known interest in Indian culture (and had even converted to the "Hare Krishna" subsect of Vaishnava <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>).
</li><li> German comedian Stefan Raab showed what happens when you go too far; in reading out a list of the most ridiculous names in Germany, he couldn't resist giving away one woman's state and occupation (as she was a gardener and her name was plant-based, and her state also has a high nature level). That led to people tracking her down and humiliating her personally; she successfully sued Raab for slander and public humiliation.
</li><li> A common Israeli <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a> tells of a girl whose first name is Okhezèt-'Anàf-'Ètz-haShakéd<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zdgf');"><sup>Hebrew </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zdgf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zdgf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">אוחזת ענף עץ השקד</span>, or "Holder of the Almond Tree Branch".

The mother jokingly said they considered giving that name to one of the girls, but the printed article described an additional child with that name. Since then there have been many different stories about OAEhS's life floating around the Internet.

</li><li> In one of his early 1970s books on modern American witchcraft, Hans Holzer interviewed a practitioner from Appalachia born in about 1930. Her name was Lavora, after Lavoris mouthwash, because her mom thought it had a pleasant sound. Today, nobody would think twice about it; the Michigan Democratic Party chairwoman is Lavora Barnes, for instance. Another commonly heard name from the 1930s is Ivory or Ivorine, for Ivory soap.
