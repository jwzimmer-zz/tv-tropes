When done right, the trope can show that someone can grow and mature once they had their share of humble pie or have suffered enough to build themselves up and get past their suffering. If done wrong, the trope can imply that you can only become a better person by suffering rather than building character on good deeds.

While some people may subscribe to this idea, it generally holds that no one should have to go through any unpleasant, distasteful activities in the first place, which is to say no one should have to go through any kind of misery to begin with, especially since, for some people, misery just builds even more misery. Furthermore, trying to invoke this trope on another person, or group of people can (and sometimes does) backfire horribly, and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">both</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">directions</a>.

</li><li> Kujira Kurokami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> based her life on the saying, "Something amazing can only be made after seeing hell," believing that any happiness would keep her from creating her best work. Thus, she forced this trope on herself, even going so far as to run away from her well-off family, change her name, hide her face, and erase her memory.

Garp follow this as he subjected his grandsons, the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace to extensive tough training, all in the hopes of forging them into strong Marines. He succeeded in the strong part, but not quite the Marines part. If anything, it just made them want to become pirates. However, the familial love is still there and Garp is proud of his grandsons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: Gozaburo Kaiba, the adoptive parent to Seto and Mokuba, was abusive to Seto on a daily basis since he made him his heir and thus had to be ruthless to survive the world of business. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">he succeeded... so much so that Seto overtook the company in adolescence</a>. Gozaburo's fate differs per adaptation (he commits suicide in the manga to further cement to Seto what happens to losers after Seto takes the company. The anime instead has him survive and upload his mind into a computer to retake his company.)
</li><li> Played straight <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. Several people, the main character included, <em>are</em> better people specifically because they can empathize with the pain others are feeling. However, the main character makes it very clear that endless suffering is like drowning, and you can only last so long without someone pulling you up for air. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The jinchuuriki who have someone supporting them turn out well, like Bee and Naruto, but the ones like Gaara who have nobody....don't turn out well.</span> And there are cases like Haku and several members of the Sound, who suffered so much that a single act of kindness or even <em>neutrality</em> made them devote themselves to people <em>just to feel needed,</em> even when they knew they were just being used as tools. The overall result seems to be 'misery can make you strong, but you'll likely go crazy and probably be overall weaker than if you had a positive upbringing'. Gaara and Lee were about on even terms without a demon transformation and Lee gained strength from support with his teacher. Killer Bee is also exceptionally strong and respected and he was raised from childhood as a recognized member of his village.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a>,</em> where on the one hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">Clair</a> does become a better person after going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a>, but on the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Daisuke</a> is a good person in part because he, unlike Clair, has had people he can connect to and rely on throughout the hard times; most of the characters who have suffered worse than Daisuke are portrayed as having something wrong with them, and the reason why Clair is a bad person in the first place is because he grew up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">whose father abused him for years</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> and/or deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a>: Decode</em>. Birdy was raised and trained by people who seemed to have this mindset, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> having undergone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> since she was no older than ten in order to become a Federation officer</span>. In the first season, the villain, Shyamalan, attempts to cause a version of this on a <em>global</em> scale, by unleashing a superweapon that will kill all but those he considers most worthy. The second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the aftermath of the ensuing disaster, shows that the survivors were able to bond over having lived through something so terrible</span>. However, by the same token, Birdy did not have as tough a life as the second season's villain, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nataru, who is now a mentally-unstable murderer after having lived through the aforementioned disaster</span>, and Shyamalan himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is implied to be wracked with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a> as the result of being a victim of a terrorist attack years ago</span>, which serves as the basis for his worldview today.

He knows that his childhood was absolutely miserable for being Broken and his dream of becoming a Huntsman who saves others would have been an impossibility if he had never met Toshinori. At the same time, he knows that his experiences, for better or worse, have shaped him and wonders if he would be as driven, empathetic, or understanding as he would have been without them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Izuku:</strong> It was... hard. A normal person's perception on having Aura is that it is a part of them like, for example, an organ. You may not ever use that organ, just like how most normal people never use Aura, but it is a part of your being. So to not have that means that you're not like other people, that you're not normal. <em>[lowers his head slightly]</em> Growing up knowing that was tough, but the tougher part of it was that everyone else also knew it too. There was no hiding it; even if I wasn't actually Broken... well, I still looked it. Even now I'm pretty short for someone my age who should've had Aura, and I've always been a little on the weaker side. My teachers would always pity me, seeing me try so hard to keep up with my peers when it must've looked so pointless. My peers would ridicule me for being born "wrong" and "Broken". Lastly, there was... Kacchan, who bullied me throughout the years as he hated to be near such a "weakling". <br/><strong>Blake:</strong> Izuku... <br/><strong>Izuku:</strong> But... all of that made me the person I am today. If I didn't go through these hardships who knows how I would turn out. Sure, I loved Toshinori Yagi before and after finding out my "Brokenness", but would I have really cared for the hardships of other people? Or perhaps I would have just wanted to be cool like him, who knows? <em>[clenches his fist]</em> It's strange how people can perceive others differently over slight differences, maybe even not so noticeable ones, and then go on to lord it over them. Like they're above such "weird" people. While my dream is to protect people, it's also my dream to change and inspire people to new paths of thinking about their surroundings. Sort of similar to your dream of changing people's minds for the better, isn't it? <br/><strong>Blake:</strong> ... I think so Izuku. I think so.

They <em>must</em> use their mystic powers for everything, including lighting lamps and cooking dinner— so when they first start their lessons, they find themselves eating raw food in the dark. This is misery too, but the instructors couldn't care less about "character." They're just motivating the students to practice and learn to adequately control their power; an important lesson, seeing as male channelers in this setting frequently end up either going insane or simply destroying themselves with their powers.

</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "The List" plays with the trope a bit. The premise is a list made by the girls ranking by cuteness comes out and Kyle becomes depressed because he's voted as the ugliest boy in his class. During said depression, he is visited by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, who shows him that ugliness can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">blessing in disguise</a>: Beautiful people often don't have to develop positive character traits in order to get what they want in life, since people usually flock to them, give them exaggerated—or even false—compliments and hand them everything because they are physically attractive. As a result, these beautiful people will have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">no redeeming qualities</a> once their looks begin to fade with age. Abe points to their classmate Clyde (voted the cutest) who was indulging in himself as proof. Ugly people have nothing handed to them and they must earn what they seek through hard work and thus will develop a strong character. However, this is subverted at first as Kyle just gets angrier at being told how to feel and he forms a plot to burn down the school in retribution.
<ul><li> It is played straight albeit in a roundabout sort of way through the B-Plot, which has Stan talk to Wendy (they're off at the time) about Kyle's ranking and their investigations reveal the list is a forgery made by some of the girls. The whole reason was that Clyde's father runs a shoe store and the girls hoped to get free shoes by buttering Clyde up. Once the two stop Kyle from committing arson and offers to show him the real list, Kyle refuses, preferring to work on himself rather than base his self-esteem on what other people think. Given how he learned Clyde was artificially bumped up just to be used, he probably learned a similar lesson and shows that misery only builds character if that's how you choose to handle it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> episode "Dreamscaperers", Stan claims the reason he's so rough on Dipper is that he's trying to toughen him up, citing the boxing lessons his own dad made him take as a child as an example.
<ul><li> However, this trope is deconstructed: because Stan never showed Dipper much affection on top being so hard on him and only him, it only took one sentence out of context to convince Dipper that Stan hated him up until he overheard Stan talking to Soos in his memories about his rough experiences.
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed and inverted (focusing on the <em>lack</em> of misery) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> episode "Puhoy." Finn finds a portal to a 'verse made entirely of pillows. Everything comes easily there to him; monsters are easy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a> easily falls in love with him. Nothing is a challenge. After an entire <em>lifetime</em> there, Finn returns to his own world and, when Jake asks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">what happened</a>, says "Eh." Even if it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>, the fact that it was all soft and comfortable made it not even worth remembering. (That episode also shows a little bump in Finn and Flame Princess' relationship, which is invigorating <em>because</em> it's not always easy).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> Early in the series, Valerie Gray was cruel, selfish, and mean-spirited like her popular friends. However, her descent into unpopularity as a result of her poverty has her turn her life around (though also by being a pawn in Vlad Masters' schemes), by becoming a ghost hunter (he gave her the equipment.) She ends up becoming a better person over time though it takes a bit of a while. Granted, Danny showing her compassion for her descent (likely because he had an impartial hand in it) also helped. It's also implied she made more of an effort when in the special "Reign Storm", Sam points out that Valerie was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> in the past and thus have little reason to trust her. Her shocked look implies that she actually listened. By the end of her growth, she has become more compassionate and her vigilantism more to help people out, even pursuing a relationship with Danny. She ends it however in order to better hunt ghosts and fear of him getting hurt (despite his family being the original ghost hunters.) She does end up becoming less harsh on ghosts, especially when she finally learns Vlad was using her against Danny.

<ul><li> The principle for Lamarckian evolution: organisms change in accordance to adversities in their life, and pass the strengths to their offspring. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">it was long discredited in favor of Neo-Darwinian evolution</a>. However, with the discovery of epigenetics, the idea is making a bit of a comeback. Of course, even with epigenetics, not everything passed down to offspring by their parents is necessarily a <em>good</em> reaction to environmental stress, making it a bit of a mixed example.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in that there are people who subscribe to the philosophy, but sadly, not the desired effect. Bully apologists, for example, use this as an excuse to sit idly by and allow bullying to continue, believing that the abuse will make the victims stronger. The results: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bullycide.org/">not so much.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> While it is true that people have become stronger in the face of adversity, this does not mean adversity always makes someone stronger.
<ul><li> Even worse are those who <em>approve</em> of bullying victims killing themselves because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">it culls the weak from the population</a> or because they disapprove of whatever traits provoked the bullying in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei">George Takei</a> has <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/UACK93xF-FE">something to say about that<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The key thing is that adversity does build character <em>if you do something to overcome it</em>, many bully apologists forget this fact when the victim is clearly overmatched and/or has no one to recur. Remember, if you are being bullied and it's too much for you, there's no shame in seeking help; and best of all, your actions count towards building character.
</li><li> <em>Even if you do something to overcome it</em>, if the trauma is strong enough there are good chances of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (<a class="urllink" href="http://bullyonline.org/old/stress/ptsd.htm">PTSD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). This trope is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> more or less crapshoot: it can build character, it may break you up - or do both.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4104b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4104b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4104b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Just ask military personnel, real and fictional, who have had to serve in times of war...</span>
</li><li> Even better when you get punished for doing something about it, showing the bullies obvious favoritism.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to its extreme with bullying's meaner big brother, hazing. The majority of lawmakers who are against passing laws against hazing often mention they were in fact in clubs or fraternities that had hazing and remembered it (through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>) as a character-building exercise that helped them bond with their fellow club members, frat brothers, etc. The problem here being that these lawmakers failed to take several factors into consideration, the biggest problem being that each generation tends to take the hazing one step further than the last, and while the lawmakers might remember their hazing as only being humiliating (such as embarrassing dare like streaking) or mildly painful (such as a fraternity paddling), hazing in recent generations has gotten so extreme that many hazing victims have been hospitalized or even <em>died</em> because of it.
</li><li> This does seem to be justifiable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> when applied to media creators making their characters miserable. One piece of advice for new writers from no less a master than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> himself is to make things as difficult as you can for your characters, so the audience may see what they're really made of. Indeed, tortured characters seem to sell very well, as long as it doesn't veer into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> (if what they're made of turns out to be "crybaby") or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina">Deus Angst Machina</a> (which can quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">exhaust and frustrate an audience</a>, even when handled realistically).
</li><li> Plenty of people who've experienced hardship (of any magnitude) value having had the experience because it taught them some sort of useful skill or helped them grow as a person, though they generally agree that they wouldn't want to do it <em>again</em>.
</li><li> A lot of private schools in the UK require school on Saturday morning/afternoon, particularly if said schools are boarding schools (or feature boarding optionally), and/or if they have sports teams who play against other school teams on that day. School holidays tend to be longer as a result. Many state schools, by contrast, put parents off with their high crime level, overcrowding, and poor teaching. Saturday schooling is a humiliating practice that inhibits proper growth and puts people off academia, and schools without it get far higher admission rates. As a result, it is dying out. The one good thing it does do is make it easier for those running their own businesses since Saturday is the most profitable day to work if you are running a business. In countries such as France and Italy, the practice is actually quite widespread and isn't thought of as strange at all. These countries sometimes get Wednesday as a day off, though those working often don't.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> by prisons. Norway is known for having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite">rather nice prisons</a> and has a reasonably low recidivism rate. The USA is known for having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">rather horrific prisons</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToComeToPrisonToBeACrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToComeToPrisonToBeACrook">make hardened criminals out of most of those who are sent there</a>. For what it's worth, <em>part</em> of the issue is that the <em>ways</em> in which US prisons are horrific are <em>especially</em> cruel to those who value compassion, while more brutal behaviours get reinforced. Still though, it goes to show that suffering alone does not build character; or, at the very least, it depends on when you suffer and why.
<ul><li> "Character" doesn't necessarily imply morality, either. The prison experience turning someone into a hardass could be this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This may be required to function to an extent. However, there is a limit (you may get PTSD for example, which is more breaking of one's character rather than the development of it). The flip-side being is that, since everyone's life always has its hardships, there's really no reason to go piling them on simply for extra misery.
</li><li> Pretty much a default part of life when living in Russia. Or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianGuySuffersMost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianGuySuffersMost">being Russian anywhere else</a>. Part of why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong">Mother Russia Makes You Strong</a>.
</li><li> Part of the reasoning behind many ascetic religious/philosophical disciplines and customs that are practiced by many different belief systems - fasting, vows of poverty/silence/chastity, food restrictions (denying oneself meat, alcohol, fatty, sweet, or other "luxury" foods), etc - willingly giving up various indulgences and accepting physical discomfort (even temporarily) is believed by many faiths to strengthen a person's faith and bring them in touch with their spiritual side. It's just believed that pleasurable things get in the way not that hardship itself is necessary. Though several paths do recognise that pleasurable things actually <em>enhance</em> spirituality if appreciated in a proper way. To a more serious extreme, being persecuted and even martyred for your faith is seen as a badge of honor by many religions.
</li><li> Part of why countless rites of passages around the world throughout history (especially for guys) involved pain - whether by combat, ritual scarring, piercing, a highly uncomfortable ritual, a dangerous stunt, survival situation, etc - a mere boy cries when he gets hurt, but a real man toughs it out and becomes stronger for it.
</li><li> Actress Virginia Hey has not been shy about saying that her time on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> was incredibly rough on her. Aside from having to shave her head and eyebrows off to play the alien Zhaan, she also had to be slathered in blue body paint that caused her kidney problems during her time on the show (although it should be noted she has no ill will toward the show or its fanbase and was willing to stay on if they could reach a compromise involving a bald cap and a different makeup, but they couldn't, and she simply couldn't handle the physical toll anymore). Looking back, she said that she actually enjoyed it for a while, since she felt like, as a former model, she was "paying her dues" and earning her stripes as a full-fledged actor. Other actors (often jokingly, but not always) have similar ideas of having to "pay your dues," involving things like filming scenes in the freezing cold, working with uncomfortable prosthetics, or having to work a long run in theater before truly being able to call yourself an actor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> is famous for saying "That which does not kill us makes us stronger". As the philosophy is antithetical to the concept of Inborn Fitness, his belief in this is often used as evidence that he wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> like many who associate him with the Nazis attest.
</li><li> During most of his public sparring sections heavyweight boxer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> would intentionally let bigger men, like Larry Holmes, beat him up in the ring without showing any of his offensive skills. This was so he could master taking punishment and have better defensive reflexes. It paid off during his historical victory against "Big" George Foreman in Zaire Africa when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RopeADope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RopeADope">laid against the ropes and let Foreman tire himself out by taking punishment</a>. However, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">backfired in his later life</a>, as he developed Parkinson's Disease as a result, and suffered greatly.
</li><li> Unhappy with the way his shy, sensitive son Rudolf was turning out, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria deliberately invoked this, assigning a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a>-type to 'toughen the boy up'. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSuicide">ended up backfiring rather spectacularly.</a>
</li><li> Studies have shown that willpower can be trained in the same way muscles can. Doing things you don't want to do, even silly ones like brushing your teeth with the "wrong" hand, makes it easier to accomplish other, more important things. Which leads to remarkable insight when one considers emotional hardship in terms of parallels to physical hardship: exercise builds muscle by tearing muscle fibers in small amounts, causing the muscles to become stronger when they heal. However, <em>over</em>exertion can lead to long-lasting or even permanent bodily harm. Apply the same principles—and more importantly, the same caveats—to the human psyche.
</li><li> The actor and musician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie">Hugh Laurie</a> was raised Presbyterian with the idea that all fun is suspicious. He has stated that he thinks he may be incapable of having fun, and describes his relationship to pleasurable things as such: "I have this thing in my head... if a thing is pleasurable it can't be any good... I try to flip it the other way and make it not pleasurable to make it good-which is insane, it doesn't make any sort of sense".
</li><li> Any sports fanbase that endures years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">finishing low on the rankings</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">getting close but no cigar to the title</a> (sometimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">alternating on both</a>). Some even get famed about being miserable (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSproutsEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSproutsEternal">with moments of hope</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">that they know won't last</a>), such as the Chicago Cubs, New York Jets, Toronto Maple Leafs, and any team from Cleveland, Buffalo and Kansas City. Or, across the pond, Liverpool FC, formerly the most successful team in English history and a European giant that last won the Premier League title in 1990. Having spent most of 1990s and early 21st century yo-yoing from 'almost, but not quite' to 'embarassingly low ranking' and back again, in a grand incident of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Yank the Dog's Chain</a>, they first racked up the third highest points tally in top division history... only to lose the title by one point to eventual champions Manchester City, who racked up the <em>second</em> highest points tally, then, in 2019-2020, when cruising to the Premier League with an unassailable 25 point lead, were suddenly stopped by the Covid-19 pandemic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>: The theatrical release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em> and the publication of Tom Brokaw's book, <em>The Greatest Generation</em> began to promote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoseTintedNarrative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoseTintedNarrative">nostalgic view of the war</a> by the Baby Boomers. These works assert that war creates good citizens, turns boys into men, calls for young people to "make extraordinary sacrifices without complaint" and precisely because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>, it builds character.
</li><li> Played straight by Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who at the age of 12 wanted to become an ascetic and chose Stoic philosophy. He is known as one of the best emperors of the Roman Empire. It <em>horribly</em> backfired on his son Commodus, who was raised in a similar way. He became a weak-minded and cruel sybarite, who enjoyed luxuries and extravaganza and admired physical prowess and pleasures.
</li><li> Averted with survivors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a>. They went through a <em>shitload</em> of crap, but most were left psychologically broken by the ordeal.
</li><li> This is also averted with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a>, especially in the first World War, as the heavy artillery barrages left soldiers traumatized and not "strong-willed heroes". The Seale Hayne Hospital in Devon, England treated veterans with shell shock and tried to return them to a semblance of previous life <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7Jll9_EiyA">going from them shambling around mindlessly in a room to a functioning member of society.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A <em>mild</em> example of this trope is basically how all physical training works. Some application of stress, such as lifting weights or jogging, will (given proper diet and rest and the like) result in one's body undergoing some adaptation, such as an increase in strength or stamina, that will make them better at dealing with that stress in the future. Naturally, a key part of the routine is not applying so much stress that actual injuries that will prevent further training while any adaptations made slowly regress are suffered.
</li><li> This is part of the Japanese concept of <em>shoganai</em>, or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCantBeHelped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCantBeHelped">It Can't Be Helped</a>", as well as the concept of <em>gaman</em>, or "enduring the unendurable".
</li><li> The soul-making theodicy (i.e. answer to the Problem of Evil-how bad things are compatible with an all-good God existing) rests on this kind of idea. Without hardship, not only would there be no character building for the person directly affected by this, but also empathy and charity for them from other people. However, of course this faces the same objections as the more general idea above (plus e.g. does this really explain the amount of evil, those which affect other living beings who don't have characters like humans, evils that cause <em>bad</em> character development, etc.).
</li><li> In a way, this is kind of how building stronger muscles works. The muscles are given a ton of stress through the workouts, and they repair themselves, adapt, and become stronger after the pain.
</li><li> A traditional keystone of military training with the notion of mental fortitude being built alongside physical conditioning and discipline. It is usually more prominent during basic training and advanced schools such as Command School, Ranger Training or other special forces induction.
