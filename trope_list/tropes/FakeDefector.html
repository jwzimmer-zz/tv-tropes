He <em>does</em> feel very bad about all this.

Later, Jeyne's mother reveals to Jaime Lannister that she has been in contact with his father, Tywin Lannister, the head of the Lannister family, and was aware of the planned betrayal of Robb Stark at the hands of one of his sworn families. She also gave her daughter drugs to prevent conception, thus ensuring the male line of the Stark family died with Robb (or so she thought).

<ul><li> Sicinnus: the private tutor of Themistocles' children took a message to King Xerxes at the Battle of Salamis advising him to attack. Whereupon the Persian fleet fell into an ambush.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Three Kingdoms of China</a>, this sort of trick was sometimes pulled. In 228, for example, Zhou Fang, the commander of Wu's Poyang commandery, offered to surrender the city of Huan to the Wei general Cao Xiu. The whole thing was a plot to draw Cao Xiu out and kill him, as he'd been a major thorn to the Wu empire for years. Some of Cao Xiu's colleagues realised it was most likely a trap and tried to warn the Wei Emperor, but Cao himself realised he'd been had and tried to withdraw before falling into the trap. Wu's forces still demolished his forces and he later died of his wounds, so it was a partial success.
<ul><li> One of the most famous examples happened before the Battle of Chibi, where the general Huang Gai sent letters to Cao Cao offering to defect. As Cao Cao had been receiving many such letters from various officials over the past few weeks, he had no reason to be particularly suspicious of Huang Gai. However, Huang Gai's ships pulled barges full of flammable material behind them and rammed Cao Cao's fleet, which combined with unseasonal winds sent fire raging through Cao Cao's fleet. Huang Gai himself nearly died during the course of the action, but was rescued by his old friend Han Dang.
</li></ul></li><li> Eric Erickson was an American-born Swedish businessman who pretended to have converted to Nazism in order to visit Germany — and scout German petroleum facilities for targeting by Allied bombers.
</li><li> This was actually a pretty common phenomenon during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>... in order to diminish the effectiveness of REAL defectors, the USSR sent several false defectors to flood US intelligence agencies with conflicting stories. One famous example came during the Golystin-Nosenko controversy, which ultimately led to the CIA shifting completely away from human intelligence to signals intelligence (e.g. wiretapping, satellite photos, cryptography...)
</li><li> One reason that the Germans had such poor intelligence in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> was that one of the finishing instructors in the spy school was actually an MI6 plant, allowing them to pick up virtually every German spy in the first few weeks. It is said that <em>no</em> German agent sent to spy on the Western allies remained loyal to the Nazis by 1945. And most turned or died in such a short time that it may well have been their intent all along.
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a> was not one, but when he left for WCW he was so bad that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcmahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcmahon">Vince Mcmahon</a> and others would ask if Russo was still on their payroll.
</li><li> In 1942, a German battalion housed in a Russian village needed to get into the rear of a Soviet unit. An 83 year old guy named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matvey_Kuzmin">Matvey Kuzmin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> volunteered to lead them there for a good sum and a hunting gun. Before they left, Matvey sent his grandson ahead to warn the Soviets. The German commander shot him once the ambush became obvious, but the 50 dead and 20 captured men were enough to make Matvey the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">oldest ever Hero of the Soviet Union</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, Ivan Susanin is mistakenly attributed the heroic deed of a Cossack named Mykyta Halahan that led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Battle of Korsuń</a>. Halahan deliberately allowed himself to be captured by the Poles so as to "reveal" the location of the Cossack camp under torture. In fact, he led them into a thick forest, allowing the Cossacks to ambush and slaughter the enemy. Halahan himself was killed by the Poles once they learned of the betrayal. In the public consciousness, Susanin is the one to lead the Poles into a swamp. They killed him but couldn't find their way back and drowned. In fact, Susanin was tortured to death by the Poles because he refused to reveal the location of the Cossacks, and his surviving family was exempt from all taxes as a reward.
