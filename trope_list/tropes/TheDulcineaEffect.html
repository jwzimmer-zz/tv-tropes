</p><p>The Dulcinea Effect is often used to hook a hero into the story or steer him in a particular plot direction. Championing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> is often an excuse for the hero to become involved in righting a larger injustice or confronting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or foiling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> when he otherwise might have simply walked away.

By application of the effect, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> usually becomes the protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>.

He immediately rushes in to protect her, and when the attacker asks why he got involved in someone else's dispute, he replies "because she's a girl". Even Liliruca is taken aback by this, and asks him "Will you save any woman just because she's a woman?"
</li><li> Gets a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MillenniumActress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MillenniumActress">Millennium Actress</a></em> with Chiyoko's lifelong quest through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel">history</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">film career</a> to be reunited with the mysterious man of her dreams, although she loves the chase more than anything. Played somewhat straight with the documentarian Genya who follows her through her journey, who repeatedly sacrifices himself for her, although we find out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had saved her life once before, on a film set, and idolized her since</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first season, Sousuke goes AWOL and abandons his post under a hostage situation to recover Kaname from the villains. Granted, she <em>was</em> the VIP he was specifically assigned to protect while the rest of the plane's occupants were not (and he had known her for a bit longer than most examples of this trope), but he was still ordered to stay with the other hostages by his superior officer. As to remove any doubt that he was planning to disobey that order, said officer also states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Sousuke's professionalism</a> meant he'd definitely <em> not</em> do emotional things like charging off after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>.
</li><li> An interesting <em>female</em> version of this is shown with Grace Weissman (AKA Gray). She hardly knows much about Sousuke (who temporarily joined her team in a mission), yet immediately defends him and, in a way, "champions" for him against her skeptical teammates' suspicions about him (who dislike him due to him only being 16, yet being an equal in their mission). Her passionately defending him eventually made one of her teammates ask her if she's going that far because she has the hots for him. Even till the end when she's killed by Gauron, her last thoughts are for Sousuke not to worry about her, and that she hopes he will be able to return safely. Considering Sousuke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">track record</a>, it isn't far off in saying Gray might've had at least <em>some</em> attraction to him.

</div></li><li> Fujiko is also responsible for causing the Dulcinea effect on Lupin; the story with Pycal began this way, and she used it on both Lupin and Goemon to get them to kill each other in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket">Lupin III (Green Jacket)</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em>, Ganta quickly becomes this way with apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> Minatsuki, feeling the need to protect her with his life and break out of Deadman Wonderland together with her.

In one case, he was shown to even be willing to continue meeting a lady, despite knowing that doing so was slowly killing him, because "she's lonely." (Granted, the lady reminded him of a mother figure he lacked, but <em>still</em>, they had just met and only talked a little.) It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">a deconstruction</a> because it shows he places no worth on his own existence or how he himself affects the lives of others, which brings him great damage <em>and</em> upsets the persons whom he wants to help. Example: he sacrifices an eye to help Doumeki when he's going blind before investigating his other options, Doumeki (who didn't want Watanuki to do such a thing in the first place), understandably gets <em>pissed off</em> at him, and a spirit that Watanuki had befriended <em>almost dies</em> trying to fix the mess.

Also in his case, it may be more a case of simply wanting to save her, because he wants to save EVERYONE (it's what heroes do, after all), and it's only in the process of trying to save her that she becomes more than just another innocent civilian that needs saving. While the Dulcinea Effect is falling in love (lust) and then helping, in Hiro's case, he was helping and then fell in love. He followed much the same pattern with Yaeko as well.

A member of this race transforms into a beautiful woman, meets with Captain Archer, and begs for help. Captain Archer immediately agrees to drop everything he was doing to help her and her people, acting like a man in love. T'Pol lampshades Archer's behavior by asking if he would be so eager to help if the shapeshifter came to him in the form of a man. When the day is saved, the "woman" thanks Archer and turns back to her true form, which looks like a giant slug. Archer is shocked, but they part on friendly terms.

<ul><li> One might think that he only did this for Lucia because she's a mysterious beauty who he's clearly smitten with at first sight, but the manga "Lunar: Younenki no owari" shows that he will literally do this for ANY girl he met 5 minutes ago, making his more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>.

As soon as Reala emerges from a giant Lens, Kyle is determined to become her hero and pursues her across the continent to do so.

All for a guy whose name she had learned only an hour or two ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> gets away with this by turning it into a part of a larger plot point: the hero not only leaps unreasonably to the heroine's defense, but he also shouts her name in the process before he's told it. Dun dun DUUUUN! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They'd been lovers over several incarnations, the latest being the one we see in-game.</span>

Those first 3 dungeons are by no means short (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheDrain">especially the third one</a>), so by the second half of the game, he and Midna have had time to bond.

Assuming you select the more proactive dialogue options in the opening Great Plateau section, it can seem like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Link</a> is perfectly willing to follow the lead of the unfamiliar woman's telepathic voice that greets him when he wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection.

</li><li> It wasn't one-sided, either — when the two finally meet up, Meryl tells Snake that she had been given psychotherapy to destroy her interest in men, and then not ten minutes later the boss from that one battle before she gets shot is telling Snake with his dying breath that he has "a large part" in her heart.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the 'good' dialogue with Elanee or Neeshka suggests a male character is acting under the Dulcinea Effect. Especially the decision to help Neeshka in her feud with her former partner, leading to the question: Why, if Neeshka didn't tell the player that if he came to Neverwinter with her he would likely be the target of assassination attempts, does he still trust her?
</li><li> The player can use this trope with regards to Safiya in the sequel as well, despite the fact that she is of a sect of wizards noted for their brutality, political scheming (read: assassinations and shadow wars), and immorality. Yet the player can completely trust her from the outset (not like you have any choice).
</li><li> A male player in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> community module Dark Avenger can behave like this towards Contessa Mignet.

Mao finds this all rather very silly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> allows a justification of the trope, where you find a drow woman being pursued by a member of the Flaming Fist (a mercenary company that acts as law and order for the region). He says she is accused of murder, and he's going to kill her... without the messiness of a trial or any of that because she's a drow. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">evil</a> and may well be guilty, but your character can protest that the law should be obeyed. The mercenary comes after you for it, and you get to fight him (with no loss of reputation, as would happen if you killed any other Flaming Fist soldier in the game).

Lucca says it best: "Crono! You brought her here, you get her back!"

His initial rescue of Agatha likely was because he was a nice guy who felt sorry for her (she was clearly upset by everything that just happened). His later decision to bring her along to the airship was because he suspected that she was a Spark, and from there, his desire to keep her around was because he liked having someone his intellectual equal to work with.

<ul><li> In the military and domestic settings:
<ul><li> A study on gender-integrated combat units suggests this trope. Seeing a female squad member injured would often see the male soldiers going a bit... berserk in response. Though given that communist nations have been using women in combat roles dating back to at least the Communist Revolution in Russia without having serious problems, it suggests that the issue might be more due to the cultural idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">Men Are the Expendable Gender</a> than anything biological.
</li><li> The Israeli army had to confront this issue when they found that for integrated squads, the casualty rate for men was unusually high. The men were throwing themselves into danger to protect their female comrades, entirely for chivalry's sake.
</li><li> When men are aroused, it's supposed to release a hormone that makes them crazy protective/territorial of the object of their desires. (Which is probably the human trait <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a> dawns from and why it's such an appealing fantasy for men and women.)
</li><li> It's <em>alleged</em> that in demos during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, police would pick on women in a group attempting peaceful protest in order to make the men... less peaceful, so they could justifiably be arrested.
</li><li> The notorious Stasi used it as late as 1989, during the riots on the evening of the 40th anniversary of the GDR, as shocked western observers noticed. The horrible police brutality led many undecided bystanders to a decision TO JOIN THE PROTEST MOVEMENT in accordance with this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanteAlighieri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanteAlighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> only saw his "beloved" Beatrice twice in life, probably for a length of time spanning less than an hour, and likely never spoke to her. Yet in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">most famous work</a> (in fact, all his famous ones), she serves as his spirit guide, muse, etc. At the time of writing, Dante was married to a different woman and had kids by her, yet none of these loved ones merit any mention in his work.
</li><li> Engaging in this practice on an Internet forum (or wiki) is derisively called "white knighting". Doing it is particularly laughable due to most net denizens being aware of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIRL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIRL">G.I.R.L.</a></em>.
</li><li> According to some accounts, the Stonewall Riots exploded when a woman, having already been hit by a police baton, shouted "Why don't you guys do something?" to a crowd of onlookers just before being roughly thrown into a paddy wagon.
