<p>In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a> show, or rather, any competition show that involves contestants being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminatedFromTheRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminatedFromTheRace">Eliminated from the Race</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VotedOffTheIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VotedOffTheIsland">Voted Off the Island</a>, some players may actually be eliminated from the game without being either. Sometimes, factors beyond their control caused them to be eliminated from the game. It's usually counted as being an actual elimination, sometimes taking the place of a scheduled elimination episode or changing it into a double-elimination period.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Non-gameplay eliminations generally come in three types:
</p><ul><li> <strong>Evacuation</strong>: Commonly seen in shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>, in which contestants are put in a physical risk, or have to compete in physical challenges. Some players may actually be injured or develop an ailment in some way that requires the medics to inspect them, and if they're deemed incapable of competing, they are evacuated from the show for medical treatment.
</li><li> <strong>Ejection</strong>: Breaking the rules should <em>not</em> go unpunished. While some people have succeeded in breaking rules or having rules slanted toward them, others deliberately break rules or attempt to cheat, trying to use loopholes. Contestants may also be removed from a reality TV <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a> because they may pose a danger to the other contestants, such as violent outbursts or threats of physical violence. This has been particularly common in "rats in a cage" style game shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em>, where familiarity breeds contempt and often leads to tempers flaring.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Quitting</strong>: Sometimes, a contestant may be eliminated simply because he quit or dropped out of his or her own will. They all have their own reasons — maybe they feel they'll be eliminated either way and it wouldn't make a difference, maybe they're having a nervous breakdown, or it may actually be a strategic attempt to throw a wrench into the game's works. One alternative is medical issues that don't quite justify an evacuation but can't simply be powered through or an attempt avoid risk further injury. Most commonly, contestants will quit a contest show for urgent personal matters, such as a death in the family or an injury that isn't an emergency, but might <em>become</em> one. This is not the same as simply asking other people to vote you off - that case it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a>.
</li></ul><p>Other types of non-gameplay eliminations may be specific to the show, such as the "Mercy Kill" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>, in which a team that falls so far behind the rest that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> will be told instead to go directly to the Pit Stop where they'll be eliminated. In cases where the team is physically incapacitated, the host will come to them and praise their efforts, but will ultimately have to dismiss them from the competition.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingElimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingElimination">Shocking Elimination</a>, although the reality of some people's elimination can be just as shocking as elimination of the early favourite to win. If the player asks to leave, but is eliminated under normal circumstances anyways, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a> (namely, asking to be nominated and evicted).

<p></p><h2>Reality Series Examples:</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    <em>Big Brother</em> </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> (Arab World)
<ul><li> The <em>entire cast</em> was ejected 11 days in... because the show drew so much fire from conservative males, outraged that men and women were living together in one area (despite the fact that the house was primarily segregated by gender and only a few parts of the house allowed the genders to interact), that the show was cancelled. A producer went into the house in person to let everyone know. Needless to say, it didn't go over well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Big Brother</em> (Australia)
<ul><li> In 2002, Belinda left the series in Week 3 because she was feeling homesick.
</li><li> In the 2008 series, Rima was removed due to breaking her leg on-set during a Friday Night Live challenge after falling awkwardly off a ramp that steadily increased in height.
</li><li> Perhaps the most controversial example was when, in the 2006 series, two housemates were removed from the game for a "Turkey slapping" incident. To save you the trouble of searching for the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NSFW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NSFW">NSFW</a>) term, a turkey slap is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the act of a male slapping another person's face with his genitalia</span>. Let's leave it at that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Big Brother</em> (Canada)
<ul><li> Ramsey chose to quit Season 4 due to a family emergency.
</li><li> Season 8 takes the cake as far as non-gameplay eliminations in <em>Big Brother</em> go. For context, there were sixteen houseguests on this season, and only <em><strong>one</strong></em> of them was evicted in the normal manner.
<ul><li> Nico walked from the house the day before the season's first eviction, while on the block. He was stressed after being one of the houseguests who received the least of a fan safety vote, and ultimately chose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">self-evict rather than be evicted</a>.
</li><li> Then Kyle and Jamar were both kicked out due to threats of violence.
</li><li> Not one week later, the <em>entire</em> rest of the house was evacuated the house due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>Big Brother</em> (Denmark)
<ul><li> In Week 13 of the very first series in 2001, the remaining 7 housemates, citing general boredom and a perceived unfair punishment for failing a weekly challenge, left the house for two hours. After negotiating some perks, four of the housemates returned, but the remaining three housemates declined.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Big Brother</em> (Israel)
<ul><li> In the second series, Maayan Hudeda was kicked out of the house by the producers for being rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband, who was also one of the housemates, chose to leave with her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Big Brother</em> (UK)
<ul><li> Europe seems to be full of rebellious ruffians. A massive 25 housemates have voluntarily left the house over the 24 series. (A few actually escaping over the roof, and one breaking the fire exit and fighting with security!)
</li><li> 8 have been thrown out, for things ranging from cheating, to alleged threats, to badly-chosen words, to physical assault. One of which, Dawn, made <em>twenty-three</em> obnoxious cries of "OH, SHUT UP" when she was caught and scolded for it and was too snooty to listen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Big Brother</em> (US)
<ul><li> Justin Sebik, who was ejected 10 days into the show because he repeatedly threatened houseguests and held a knife to Krista Stegall's throat after a busy night of drinking. Said incident is now called "The Knife Incident". It resulted in tightened rules about violence so that nobody is allowed to come even close to what he did, and alcohol is no longer allowed in excess on the show- it can only be handed out in Head Of Household baskets in moderation, as gifts supplied by Pop TV, and for the Final 3 celebration dinner. Also, Justin received a psychological combing over in the Diary Room, where the show's psychiatrist and the producer at the time both talked to him extensively and realized he was a danger to the house. In his interview post-expulsion, even host Julie Chen was fearful at the way he seemed incapable of recognizing that his actions in the house were totally unacceptable and that Justin felt he should be allowed back in!
</li><li> Scott Weintraub in Season 4 was expelled/walked after repeated rulebreaking, having a few outbursts in the house, and possibly diagnosed with an STD. What had happened was he had a severe emotional meltdown after being forced to share a roof with Amanda, his ex-fiancee. Although everyone with the exception of an odd girl out was subjected to this treatment, Scott took it especially hard because she had been able to move on with her life after their engagement was broken; he however, was not. Scott flipped out and began flinging chairs all over the living room and "joking" that he was going to hit people with a life-sized chess piece in the backyard. Eventually, Scott was told to go to the Diary Room but continued to ignore the summons, until finally admitting he needed help and calling everybody into the house for an intervention, where they all agreed this atmosphere was bad for him and unlike the other houseguests would not be able to put up with it. Scott at last entered the Diary Room and was basically given the same assessment as Justin and, through both a combination of unwilling to continue the game and psychological red flags, was walked off the show. Amanda ended up being the next to go, and even told Scott she was already practically decided on as the first official eviction, but Scott's attitude had already been soured too much to have the will to stay on, and what he did in the four episodes he was on the show made it clear he was going to be miserable no matter what and possibly even driven insane.
</li><li> In Season 11, Chima was expelled about half-way through the game. Since Week 1 she had <em>knowingly</em> broken rules such as refusing to come to the diary room when called, not wearing a microphone, and covering cameras with blankets, but during Week 6 she just broke down due to Jeff using the coup-de'tat when she was HOH. Chima walked out to practice for the upcoming Veto competition and didn't take her microphone with her. Natalie and Kevin then went to get her microphone for her so she wouldn't get penalized, but instead of accepting it she <em>threw it in the hot tub</em>, then refused to pay for it. The following night, she was removed from the house for knowingly breaking rules and refusing to pay for the microphone she destroyed. And this, children, is why her nickname after that was Hirochima — pronounced the same way. In fact, Chima's misconduct was taken so badly that she was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">banned from joining the Jury</a></em>. Instead, in a throwback to the traditional voting system, America got to cast one vote of its own (which may actually be a nice addition if used correctly).
</li><li> The one houseguest who left, Neil, was promptly replaced and his reasons for leaving were not made public, all that is known was that it was an "urgent family matter". Any reasons for him actually leaving are purely speculative.
</li><li> Season 12 had one would-be houseguest, Paola Aviles, bail out during the pre-show sequester period. Going to the bathroom while being filmed skeeved her out, and she hadn't been reading up on her contract. Her suddenly departure from the game caused producers to have a cast short one contestant that year and a smaller Jury, so they began expanding the prospective contestant pool to accommodate sudden vacancies.
</li><li> Season 13 had Season 8 winner and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> "Evel Dick" Donato walk from the house after only six days. At the time, Dick stated that he had left due to a family emergency, but revealed a few years later that he had been diagnosed as HIV positive and left the house for that reason.
</li><li> Season 14:
<ul><li> As it turned out, Season 14 saw another last-minute dropout, Mike, and Joe Arvin was given a lucky pass to take his spot.
</li><li> Ironically, after the effort made to plug up a sudden dropout, the season gives us Willie Hantz (yes, brother of the infamous Russell Hantz from <em>Survivor</em>), who was thrown out of the house about a week in for headbutting another houseguest. Guess who it was? Joe. That means that because Mike left the show, Willie got expelled. Then again, given Willie's temper and totally hated presence in the house, it was probably only a matter of time, anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 19 had Megan Lowder, a Navy veteran. In an instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> during week one, she misheard fellow houseguest Jessica talking about Asian houseguest Alex and thought she had used a racist term to refer to Alex. Rather than talk to Jessica about this, Megan went directly to Alex and told her what she thought she heard. Alex goes to talk to Jessica about it, a few more conversations happen, and the entire house promptly blows up at Megan for so quickly accusing someone else of racism. This ended up triggering Megan's trauma from the Navy, and she decided to leave the house the same day.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Bigg Boss</em> (the Indian <em>Big Brother</em>)
<ul><li> In an attempt to atone for the Shilpa Shetty racism controversy, Jade Goody was a houseguest on the second series of this version of the show. She left on day 2 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer, and died 8 months later. Ominously, some people claim Goody was punished/cursed for her misdeeds and made to pay with them with her life through some dark-lore Hindu retribution because they were <em>that</em> bad.
</li><li> In that same series, Rahul quit just <em>5 days</em> away from the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> (UK)
<ul><li> Australian feminist writer Germaine Greer walked off Series 3 because she believed two fellow celebrity houseguests (actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrigitteNielsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrigitteNielsen">Brigitte Nielsen</a> and horse racing analyst John McCririck) were being bullied by the cast and crew.
</li><li> Series 5 saw three walk-outs. Donny Tourette, the vocalist for the punk rock band Towers of London, escaped the house by jumping over a fence because he refused to act as a servant to fellow contestant Jade Goody (who was also a contestant on this season, along with her boyfriend and mother). Film director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenRussell">Ken Russell</a> quit a few days later after he had an argument with the Goody family. Finally, pop singer Leo Sayer also quit by escaping the house, finding an exit through a crew-only area.
</li><li> Series 6 had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugababes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugababes">Sugababes</a> singer Mutya Buena quit in a much less dramatic fashion than the trio of walkers the previous season. After narrowly escaping eviction, she decided to voluntarily leave later that night. Other similarly non-controversial walk-outs include R&amp;B singer Ray J and club DJ Brandon Block in Series 19 and Youtuber Trisha Paytas in Series 20.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emmerdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emmerdale">Emmerdale</a></em> star Claire King had to leave Series 14 after she had to receive medical attention. Two days later, it was announced she would not be returning. Another <em>Emmerdale</em> cast member, Roxanne Pallett, quit Series 21 following an altercation with actor Ryan Thomas.
</li><li> R&amp;B singer Alexander O'Neal quit Series 15 following an argument with gossip blogger Perez Hilton.
</li><li> Model and singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TilaTequila" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TilaTequila">Tila Tequila</a> was ejected from the show on the second day of Series 15, following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">a controversy</a> involving Nazi-sympathizing social media posts that also ended her career in general.
</li><li> Another trio of walks happened in Series 17, two due to tragic circumstances. First, blogger Jonathan Cheban left voluntarily on Day 7. Television producer David Gest left on medical grounds and died of a heart attack shortly after the series aired. Angela Bowie was informed of the death of her ex-husband <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> during the run of the show, and was asked whether she wanted to continue competing; although she stayed for a few more days, she ultimately decided to leave.
</li><li> Actor Christopher Biggins was ejected from Series 18 after he made antisemitic and homophobic comments that shocked the other houseguests, production team, and the British public.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Gran Hermano</em> (Spain)
<ul><li> In season 1, contestants Silvia and Israel developed romantic feelings for each other early on. Both of them were nominated on week 4, and when Israel got the boot the following week, Silvia decided to quit the show and leave with him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Sims Big Brother</em> and <em>Big Brother Sim Edition</em>:
<ul><li> In season 4, Johnny had a family emergency and had to leave; but he did come back and made it to fourth place.
</li><li> In season 6, Gary had a heart attack and had to be evacuated within week two. Keri <em>almost</em> left, but decided not to.
</li><li> In <em>Sim Edition 2</em>, Melissa left and let Pepper continue in her place.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    <em>Survivor</em> </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<h2><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em></h2>
<h3>U.S. Evacuations</h3>
<ul><li> <em>The Australian Outback</em>, in which contestant Michael accidentally passed out in the fire from a freak gust of wind and suffered burns to his face and hands.
</li><li> <em>Panama</em>, Bruce started suffering from stomach pains in the middle of the merge, revealing he had not used the bathroom since a Panamanian village reward his tribe went to. Eventually, the pain got to the point where the medical crew took him away from camp, and two days after the event, Jeff went to camp to inform his tribemates that Bruce was suffering from a blocked digestive system, and was officially removed from the game. Fortunately, Bruce recovered enough to be on the jury.
</li><li> <em>Two</em> people were actually removed due to injury in <em>Micronesia</em> (aka <em>Fans vs. Favorites</em>).
<ul><li> Jonathan Penner was removed due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">horrible puncture wound on his knee</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">was actually shown on TV</a>. Shame, since he was playing better that season.
</li><li> In another moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>, James was removed from the game for having a really terrible injury to his finger, but he could at least serve in the Jury. He was seen as reeling in an IV to Tribal Council.
</li><li> And to make matters worse, several <em>other</em> players had some rather bad things happen to them. There was a rumour that Chet Welch may have actually been evacuated due to a piece of coral that was stuck in his foot had he not been voted out when he was. (Meaning they likely voted him out knowing he'd get evacuated — had they picked someone else, they would have lost two.)
</li></ul></li><li> Joe was removed in <em>Tocantins</em> for a life-threatening infection in his leg. It is likely that this was why the show used a "Final Two, Jury of Seven" endgame as opposed to the "Final Three, Jury of 7-9" that the show has been more fond of using in recent years.
</li><li> <em>Samoa</em>:
<ul><li> Mike (about 62 years old) had incredibly-low blood pressure and almost passed-out in front of the medics. And this happened in the <em>second episode</em> — the earliest someone has ever been evacuated from the game.
</li><li> Later, Russell S. fell unconscious in a challenge and was found to have blood pressure <em>even lower than Mike's</em> (when he was around 20 years younger). Fans even pointed out signs of Jaundice. When Russell insisted that he get sent back to the game, Jeff was actually pleading him to stop. Jeff is not even that medical-savvy, and he was worried for Russell's life.
</li><li> On top of all that, Ben might've been evacuated if he hadn't been voted out — he admitted in an interview that he tore a ligament in his leg.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>One World</em>:
<ul><li> The first person removed, Kourtney, jumped the wrong way during the first Immunity Challenge and landed on one of her hands, breaking her wrist. Notable for a non-gameplay elimination being the <em>first</em> elimination from the game.
</li><li> Happened again just before the merge, when Colton was evacuated due to suspected appendicitis. It's not entirely clear what happened after that, though it seems Colton's sickness turned out not to be as serious as it appeared.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Caramoan</em>
<ul><li> Shamar was evacuated in episode 4 after getting sand in his eye. Medical deemed that it would be worse if he stayed, as he could've gotten a corneal abrasion.
</li><li> Later on, Erik Reichenbach was evacuated shortly after the Tribal Council where Brenda Lowe was voted out, as he was totally spent and his body couldn't take the game anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> While not evacuated for medical reasons, Terry Deitz in <em>Cambodia</em> had to be pulled from the game when he heard the news of his son in the hospital. It has been confirmed that he had no choice but to go home, even if he wanted to stay for some crazy reason.
</li><li> <em>Kaoh Rong</em> currently holds the record for most evacuations, at 3.
<ul><li> Caleb Reynolds was evacuated in episode 4 of <em>Kaoh Rong</em> due to dehydration. Shame, since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">Took a Level in Kindness</a> since his stint on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em>.
</li><li> Neal was also evacuated shortly after the merge due to an infection in his leg, similar to Jonathan Penner and Joe Dowdle.
</li><li> At the final 5, Joe was pulled due to constipation and bladder problems after winning a reward challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em> David vs. Goliath </em> Pat was evacuated due to a back injury gained while on the boat ride back from the challenge. It was raining, and the boat hit a wave which caused Pat to hit his back, injuring it.
</li></ul><h3>U.S. Quits/Withdrawals</h3>
<ul><li> The most famous was Osten in <em>Pearl Islands</em>. He claimed that his body was shutting down, but nobody believed him and said that it was because he just couldn't take it anymore. (Well, he <em>did</em> barter away all his clothing except for his boxers...) It was somewhat clear Osten wasn't fitting in on the show — in a past episode, while his fellow tribe members had fun with a nearby pelican, his reaction was to <em>glare at it</em> and <em>sharpen his machete</em>.
</li><li> <em>All-Stars</em> had two people voluntarily quit the game.
<ul><li> Jenna Morasca's quit was <em>highly</em> justified, as her mother was undergoing treatment for cancer and she received some "bad vibes". Turned out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">her mother died eight days later.</a>
</li><li> Susan Hawk, meanwhile, left after feeling violated following an immunity challenge where a naked Richard Hatch had unintentionally or deliberately rubbed his body up against hers. They've since made peace.
</li></ul></li><li> Janu Tornell of <em>Palau</em> quit the game, and she actually was the first to attempt it as a gameplay maneuver — everyone else on the Koror tribe was mocking her and constantly belittling her. She obviously wasn't going to be leaving anytime soon, since their main target was Stephenie LaGrossa (the true outsider and the only Ulong member left). So in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">"throw a wrench in their works", she voluntarily quit the game.</a> The fact that she had been sick since early in the game and was practically wasting away also factored in her decision, and it was surprising she hung in there for so long.
</li><li> <em>Fiji</em> (in)famously had a contestant quit before the season even began. Melissa McNulty dropped out the night before filming started because she was having panic attacks, leaving <em>Fiji</em> to start with an odd number of players (the only season, so far, to do so).
</li><li> Also in <em>Fiji</em>, Gary "Papa Smurf" Strikesky quit because he was having trouble breathing as a result of an allergic reaction to bug bites.
</li><li> Kathy Sleckman of <em>Micronesia</em> also quit the game, but it was a good thing she did... she was having a nervous breakdown.
</li><li> In <em>Nicaragua</em>, NaOnka and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">"Purple" Kelly</a> both quit at the Day 28 Tribal Council - the first time that two people quit consecutively. Jeff was visibly disgusted by their lack of endurance, and put their torches on display for the rest of the season. The rules have since changed to prevent players without serious issues from quitting; instead preferring for them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">just ask to be voted out if they weren't in any danger of dying.</a>
</li><li> Dana leaving in <em>Philippines</em> was technically a quit, since she was too sick to continue but the medical team wouldn't pull her out because it wasn't life-threatening.
</li><li> After his medical evacuation in <em>One World</em>, Colton left early again in <em>Blood vs. Water</em>, this time simply saying that he's miserable and that he isn't fitting in with his tribe - though tribemates stated that he was acting like this even <em>before</em> events didn't go in his favor, and that he's simply griping because they're not accommodating his strategy (he wants "chaos", as he puts it; while they actually want to be nice and civil to each other and make their month in the wilderness relatively pleasant). Jeff, who already has "needless quitting" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>, was unwilling to take his shit this time and delivered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Cagayan</em>, Lindsey quit after arguing with Trish due to the latter helping blindside Cliff and not wanting to assault Trish.
</li><li> In <em>San Juan del Sur</em>:
<ul><li> Sisters So and Doo Kim left before the start of filming due to one of them failing a medical test, resulting in an uneven starting ratio of male vs. female contestants. So was brought back as a castaway on the following season, <em>Worlds Apart</em>.
</li><li> Julie quit because of missing her boyfriend and to avoid being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawn">The Pawn</a> for Jeremy's alliance.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>David vs. Goliath</em>, Bi Nguyen sprained her knee during an immunity challenge. It was not life threatening, but she's a professional MMA fighter so it had the potential to affect her career; and she decided to withdraw to receive proper medical treatment.
</li><li> <em>Edge of Extinction</em> was built so that those voted out were not completely eliminated from the game, but <em>were</em> now allowed to walk out and complete their removal at any time, no questions asked. Keith and Wendy decided to do so after they failed to earn their way back into the game at the merge.
</li><li> As <em>Winners at War</em> uses the Edge of Extinction, the same rules apply. Sandra decided to walk out immediately after stepping foot onto the Edge, knowing there was no chance of her coming back via reentry game, and feeling she has done enough.
</li></ul><h3>U.S. Ejections</h3>
<ul><li> Dan Spilo from <em>Island of the Idols</em> became the first contestant to ever be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">kicked off the show</a> after he was reported to have harassed a member of the production crew. Spilo's behavior around female contestants had been an issue for most of the season, especially after Kellee Kim had accused him of touching her inappropriately. Spilo was given a formal warning by the producers, but was allowed to remain on the show, a decision that proved to be controversial for the rest of the season. The incident with the crew member was ultimately the final straw, and Dan was removed from the game on Day 36. The remaining five castaways were informed of the decision by Probst that morning. No goodbyes, no placement on the jury, no final words.
</li></ul><h3>U.S. Other</h3>
<ul><li> Mention must be made of Brandon's exit from <em>Caramoan</em> as he was having an emotional meltdown, daring his tribe to vote him out and being a hair's breadth away from assaulting another player. In the midst of talking him down, Jeff did hold an impromptu vote to make his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a> official, but it's unlikely production would have allowed him to keep playing anyway.
</li><li> In <em>Game Changers</em>, though he was technically eliminated by a vote at Tribal Council, Jeff Varner was de facto disqualified for outing another contestant, Zeke Smith, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> in an attempt to make Zeke look untrustworthy. The other members of the Nuku tribe (particularly Tai, who is gay) immediately tore into Varner for his behavior, and Jeff Probst sobered Varner with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">harrowing news that this would not just be broadcast between the tribe, but millions of viewers</a>. That meant Varner had effectively told the country Zeke was transgender and made it impossible for him to go back to a life of privacy.
</li></ul><h3><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AustralianSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AustralianSurvivor">Australian Survivor</a></em></h3>
<ul><li> The first non-gameplay elimination on the Australian show came in the 2016 season, when Peter Fiegehen quit just ten days into the game.
</li><li> Ross Clarke-Jones was evacuated from the 2019 season after suffering a broken ankle at the Day 28 Immunity Challenge.
</li><li> Lee Carseldine was evacuated from the 2020 <em>All Stars</em> season for a family emergency, shortly before his mother passed away.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em> (US)
<ul><li> The threat of being "evacuated" has been cited by contestants several times, the first being Steve &amp; Dave in Season 4. Dave wrenched his knee badly while doing a glacier trek on the first episode, and rather than allow the show's medics the chance to declare him unfit to continue, he declined medical attention. It was, it turns out, badly enough damaged that he required surgery to repair it once he got home. Despite that, they made it several more legs before they were eliminated.
<ul><li> It seems that, unless they're in risk of dying, like when Bopper was disqualified at the beginning of Season 24, the Race's policy is to let the team decide whether or not to keep going. In Season 22, Dave tore his Achilles tendon, and desperately needed surgery to even walk, yet was allowed to keep running the Race until they finally dropped out at the beginning of the fifth leg.
</li></ul></li><li> Jim and Marsha during Season 5 nearly missed the very first flight of the game after Jim tripped on the run from the starting line to their baggage for the first clue and tore his knee open in the fall. The airlines refused to let him board without getting medical attention first, and the time it took to get to the first aid center and back nearly made them too late to board.
</li><li> As for the quitting, there was Marshall &amp; Lance, who simply stopped during a task in Egypt in season 5. In this case, there was also a knee injury involved, but they did quit rather than being removed from the Race for medical reasons.
</li><li> In season 11, Uchenna and Joyce took a gamble on a flight where they had an hour to connect and ended up missing the connection. They ended up about twelve hours behind everyone else and when they finally got to Malaysia, they were sent straight to the pit stop and eliminated.
</li><li> In Season 15, Maria &amp; Tiffany chose to quit when they were unable to complete either Detour choice.
</li><li> As already mentioned, Dave &amp; Connor had to drop out of Season 22 due to Dave's injury, making them the only team to drop out when they already weren't in last place and about to be eliminated anyway.
</li><li> Meanwhile, there usually is at least one Mercy Kill per season. Season 2 had three Mercy Kills, including two legs in a row.
</li><li> Mercy Kills were administered in both Season 1 and 4's finales, with Bill &amp; Joe and David &amp; Jeff not even making it to the Final Destination city before the race ended.
</li><li> Similar to the Mercy Kill is the Field Elimination, which happens when a team is unable to complete a task (or unwilling to quit), so Phil goes out to eliminate them on the course. It happened twice on Season 16.
<ul><li> One of the most famous was in Season 6, where Lena and Kristy were field eliminated by Phil in the field after spending <em>ten hours</em> unrolling hay bales for a clue. (They weren't eliminated until two hours after the final team checked in.)
</li></ul></li><li> Season 15's Zev &amp; Justin are the only team to officially be ejected, when they lost one of their passports, and were therefore unable to continue on the race.
<ul><li> Season 13's Toni &amp; Dallas also would have been ejected from the game for losing their passports in Moscow, that is had they not lost all their money as well. Instead, they were subject to a Field Elimination.
</li><li> Season 21's James &amp; Abba also lost a passport in Moscow, but were saved by a non-elimination leg and allowed to run (and lose) the next leg thanks to it also taking place in Moscow.
</li></ul></li><li> In Season 18, Mel &amp; Mike recounted after their final episode they were told by the medical team to end the task they were doing (searching around in mud during the Japanese winter) because they both had hypothermia. The only other team behind them finished the task and made it to the Pit Stop before producers told Mel &amp; Mike to do the same to be eliminated.
</li><li> In Season 23, Chester &amp; Ephraim hit not one, but three delayed flights on their way into Portugal, getting in long after night had fallen and the other teams had checked in. It took them so long, Phil met them at the airport to eliminate them.
</li><li> In Season 26, Bergen &amp; Kurt couldn't drive stick shift, so they abandoned their car - only to arrive at a task that required a car to complete. After finishing a penalty, they tried to get to their next destination via train, only to get hopelessly lost. They wound up going to a train station and waiting there until Phil came out to eliminate them in the field.
</li><li> In Season 27, Kelly &amp; Shevonne struggled on the first leg's Detour so much that, by the time they completed one of them, Phil came to eliminate them.
</li></ul></li><li> In Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent">America's Got Talent</a></em>, the Russian Bar Trio had to withdraw due to injury. This injury led to Donald Braswell re-entering the competition and later making it to the final 5.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel">America's Next Top Model</a></em>
<ul><li> In the middle of the second episode of season 3, the girls received an envelope eliminating Magdalena, no explanation given.
</li><li> In season 5, during the makeover, Cassandra was frustrated that her hair was cut very short. Tyra was still not pleased and asked to cut her hair even shorter, to which Cassandra refused - and quit the show.
</li><li> Season 9 saw Ebony decide to leave after she was chosen over Ambreal, citing Modelling wasn't for her.
</li><li> Season 10 saw Kimberly walk out of judging before the first evaluation because she had trouble focusing due to the suicide of a friend.
</li><li> Terra was ejected from the game in episode 3 of season 15 right after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMakeover">The Makeover</a> because she treated her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryHairstyleChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryHairstyleChange">Expository Hairstyle Change</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut">Traumatic Haircut</a> and the judges (Mr. and Ms. J) found it very unprofessional.
</li><li> Ondrei quits in the early episodes of season 16 because she can't keep her focus on the competition due to her dead brothers.
</li><li> Angelea was disqualified in the finals of the All-Star season for (at the time) unspecified reasons.
</li><li> In the US vs UK season, Louise stormed out of panel because of judge Kelly Cutrone telling her to get her attitude in check. It's worth noting that the two fought during the photo shoot as well. Louise chose not to come back. Near the finale, Alisha did what Ebony did in season 9 when she she was chosen over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">that season's Eboni</a>. She quit because she doesn't want to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationHoudini">Elimination Houdini</a>.
</li><li> In cycle 21, Romeo was disqualified for headbutting another contestant while drunk.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>
<ul><li> Season 1 had a contestant disqualified for lying about his age (he made it to the semi-finals before he was discovered)
</li><li> Season 2 had two contestants disqualified for criminal pasts, despite one contestant disclosing it to Idol and him being acquitted of said charge laid against him.
</li><li> Season 5 had twins that were disqualified for identity theft.
</li><li> Chris Golightly from Season 9 was disqualified for having a record contract at the time of his audition (the rules stated that if you have a previous deal, it ends right then and there)
</li><li> In season 11, Jermaine Jones was disqualified after making it to the top 12, when it was revealed to the producers that he had more than one outstanding arrest warrant under other names.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheApprentice">The Apprentice</a></em> (UK):
<ul><li> In the first season Adele quit the show, claiming that she couldn't stay due to a family emergency. Sir Alan Sugar allowed her resignation to stand, but didn't really believe the reason she gave, and thought she was just trying to pull the "You can't fire me because I quit!" card before she could get axed due to her horrific track record in the contest.
</li><li> In Season 3, Ifti effectively quit in the second week because he couldn't handle being away from his family.
<ul><li> Jadine from the same season was a similar case; she was arguably the frontrunner for much of the season despite her incredibly abrasive attitude, so it came as a shock when she suffered a complete breakdown in the second-last task because she was missing her daughter, at which point she basically gave up. Sugar was initially going to fire Lohit that week, but got rid of Jadine instead once it became clear that she was in no condition to continue.
</li></ul></li><li> Adam from Season 5 quit prior to the show even starting. He filmed the beginning vignettes and was seen in the group shot of them crossing the bridge, only to drop out less than a day before the start of actual filming.
</li><li> Raleigh from Season 6 quit between the first and second tasks after his brother was severely injured while serving with the British Army.
</li><li> Adam was sent home from the first <em>Junior Apprentice</em> season after he came down with a virus, and was deemed not to be in a fit state to continue.
</li><li> Aleksandra from Season 12 abruptly bailed out on the show at the start of the fourth episode, saying that she was missing her family too much to continue on the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheApprentice">The Apprentice</a></em> (US):
<ul><li> In season 3, Verna attempted to quit the show halfway through the second task because she was too stressed out, but Donald Trump's adviser Carolyn chased after her and persuaded her to return. Verna stayed on until the end of the task, at which point she quit anyway.
</li><li> In season 6 (the Los Angeles season), Michelle quit during the third Boardroom session. She had grown tired of sleeping in a tent, she was an outcast within her team, and she said she would probably get fired that episode anyway.
</li><li> In <em>Celebrity Apprentice 1</em>, Vincent Pastore quit the show after a massive fall-out with Piers Morgan.
</li><li> Khloe Kardashian got thrown out of <em>Celebrity Apprentice 2</em> when Trump found out that she had a DUI conviction, and had taken a break from her community service assignments to do the show. Dennis Rodman had also been fired the previous episode for his constant drinking, though that more directly affected his performance in the tasks.
</li><li> Michael Johnson withdrew from <em>Celebrity Apprentice 3</em> due to an implied family emergency.
</li><li> The last civilian season gave us Anand, who- in a relatively rare occurrence for reality TV- was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">expelled for cheating</a>. During the sixth task, in which he was project manager, he sent out a bunch of text messages to his friends in an attempt to sell chariot rides. Nobody responded, but his team won anyway. Trump eventually found out about it, and it hit the fan at the start of episode 9. When confronted about the texts, Anand actually <em>lied right to Trump's face</em>, saying that he hadn't sent any, only coming clean when Trump read some of them aloud to everyone else. His elimination still technically counts as a firing, but as it's safe to say it wouldn't have happened were it not for the texts, it counts as this as well.
<ul><li> Anand was actually the second Non Gameplay casualty from that task. The first came in episode 7, when it turned out that Mahsa had blabbed to the men's team about how much money the women had made, prior to the boardroom for that task. When it was brought up in the boardroom, Mahsa tried to claim that she had only said it in response to opposing team-member Clint telling her what the men had made. This led to Clint and the other guys storming back into the boardroom and calling Mahsa a liar, which was backed up by <em>Mahsa's own team-mates</em>. This finally caused Mahsa to go crazy, drop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a> at Trump, and then accuse the other candidates of conspiring against her. Trump said that Mahsa was either a complete idiot or totally disloyal, and sent her packing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Celebrity Apprentice 4</em> had two withdrawals. The first was when Jose Canseco had to leave in the fifth episode, after discovering that his seriously ill father had just days to live. The second saw NeNe Leakes storm off the show for initially unspecified reasons; Trump called her later in the episode, at which point she basically accused him of having a hard-on for fellow contestant Star Jones, and told him to go fuck himself.
</li><li> In what became the final season, Chael Sonnen was expelled for cheating as well. He cut a cord to a computer to buy his team some extra time on a task. He didn't think it was cheating, but Arnie thought otherwise. Notably, when expelling Chael, rather than saying "Youre terminated" like he did with everyone else, Arnie outright said, "Youre fired".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBiggestLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBiggestLoser">The Biggest Loser</a></em>
<ul><li> Season 3 was the first to end with four finalists instead of the three from the first two seasons. Apparently, the producers had planned to have viewers vote which of the two lowest achieving finalists to eliminate like in subsequent seasons, but this was never announced. In the finale, it was announced that one of the finalists had withdrawn from the competition, but still showed up to reveal why. It turned out to be Heather who had become pregnant.
</li><li> In Season 11, Week 17, one of the favorites to win, Olympic gold medalist Rulon Gardner, dropped out of the competition for "personal reasons", the first Biggest Loser contestant to actually quit, rather than throw the weigh in to get eliminated. However, there are rumors that he was encouraged to drop out, due to supposed rule breaking, though the rumors have not been proven.
</li><li> Season 13 has Joe, who walked off the show the week after his brother was eliminated, simply because he was missing his family too much. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Bob did not take it well.</a>
</li><li> Every season has several eliminations that tread the line between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, as contestants volunteer to be voted off so people who need it more can stay. This is especially common in seasons where Parent-child teams are common. In fact, in season 11, the parents all made a pact to make sure they were all gone before any of the kids.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Blood, Sweat and Tools</em>
<ul><li> In the sixth episode the Purple Team, Steve and Richelene were thrown off the show after Steve was caught attempting to use a mechanical auger — essentially a three-foot long corkscrew powered by a petrol engine — without the assistance of a second person. By itself that would likely have just gotten him yelled at by resident power tool expert Helder, but Steve got in Helder's face and made implied threats of physical violence, before proceeding to trash the team's workspace, resulting in the experts stopping the challenge and ejecting the team there and then without bothering to wait for the end of the episode, when the weakest team was meant to be eliminated — which, in an added twist of idiocy, was guaranteed <em>not</em> to be the Purple Team, as they had gained immunity after winning the episode's first challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Boot Camp</em>
<ul><li> In the first episode Katherine quit as she couldn't handle the environment.
</li><li> In the third episode, Thomson (who had been suffering from unspecified medical issues) was medically discharged, albeit with much regret. One of the marines actually cried during the process.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Bullrun</em>
<ul><li> One team (Jesus Reyes and Chuck Aguilar) forfeited the race in season one after one of their relatives died. The other chose to leave with him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver">Canada's Worst Driver</a></em>
<ul><li> Season 2: Colin Sheppard deliberately performed so poorly in every test that he was expelled from Driver Rehab in the fourth episode. All participants relinquish their car keys upon arrival and are returned when they graduate; Colin's keys were destroyed and his vehicle towed back to his hometown. Host Andrew Younghusband remarked "Let's hope Colin loses his license before his life."
</li><li> Season 4: Donna Hicks was sent home in the fourth episode after exceptionally poor performance coupled with an angina attack. Donna was convinced that she could drive, despite all evidence to the contrary. The province of Ontario reviewed her driver's license after the show; she did not pass the review.
</li><li> Season 5: Crystal Hubley-Fararo left in the fifth episode after learning that her brother-in-law had been killed in a vehicular collision. A video retrospective of the rest of the rehab subjects revealed that they consistently failed to yield, the same behaviour that got Crystal's brother-in-law killed.
</li><li> Season 6: Scott Shurink was expelled in the second episode after revealing on-camera his numerous undocumented vehicular crimes: more than just excessive speeding (which ended his first test in the first episode), he drove while drunk, while suspended, and used his friend's license. Said friend immediately cancelled the vehicle insurance Scott needed to drive, while resident traffic law expert and retired OPP sergeant Cam Wooley contacted the Calgary police with this information. He was arrested for drug charges in December of 2010 then later was caught speeding in 2015.
</li><li> Season 9 (<em>Canada's Worst Driver Ever</em>) saw <em>three</em> drivers and one nominator leave for non-gameplay related reasons:
<ul><li> Henrietta Gallant was sent home at the end of the first episode, after admitting that she pretty much gave up driving after being named the worst driver in Season 2, and didn't intend to start driving regularly again no matter how well or poorly she did in the season.
</li><li> Angelina Marcantognini was sent away for mental health treatment at the end of the fourth episode, after her severe emotional problems had caused her to fail every single challenge she attempted (along with abusing alcohol and anti-depressants), and it was obvious that the stress of being on the show would only cause her to get worse.
</li><li> Michael Telford's nominator Yolanda got the dubious honor of being the first nominator ever to be ejected after Michael and the judges decided that she was more of a hindrance than a help to Michael's rehabilitation. She was replaced with her husband and Michael's friend (and original nomiator back in season 2) Eric.
</li><li> Dale Pitton ran away from rehab, injured her hand (deliberately, in the opinion of the experts) and showed no signs of taking the lessons to heart, and was ejected at the end of episode 7. In a twist she nearly got named Canada's Worst Driver Ever anyway, but avoided it mostly because the show's judges had already decided to contact the relevant authorities and request that her driving license be revoked, in which case the "worst driver" title would be redundant.

<ul><li> Season 4: Brian Pugh was ejected from the show after an unexplained incident (though believed to have involved violent threats) between him and fellow contestant Brian Macdonald.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Cannonball Run 2001</em>
<ul><li> Team Forbidden Fruit was disqualified for a rule violation. One of the rules was that teams weren't allowed to touch other teams' cars. At the start of episode two, the teams were held up by a locked gate. Forbidden Fruit used the confusion caused to play a joke on another team by stealing the keys from their ignition and running with them. Despite their argument that "a key is not a car", it was determined they had violated the rule and sent packing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Coach Trip</em>
<ul><li> Alan and Lorenzo from the second series were the first example of this, quitting after Clare and Cat were eliminated in the conventional manner, as they didn't like any of the other couples on the show.
</li><li> Jess and Becky quit later in the second series, after learning that one of Jess's family had been severely injured in the July 7th, 2005 terror attack on London.
</li><li> Bruce and John got kicked out of the fourth series after Bruce started a fight on the coach for no readily apparent reason, and then refused to apologize for doing so.
</li><li> In the sixth series, Rara and Jasmin were removed from the show after going on a drunken rampage through the hotel where the group was spending the night.
</li><li> After getting complaints that the couples in the seventh series were being excessively loud in their various hotels, tour guide and host Brendan warned them that for the next few days at least, he'd be taking a zero-tolerance policy toward that behaviour. Tony and Wolfy disregarded the warning, caused a major ruckus that night, and were thrown off the show the following morning. This in turn caused Frankie and Alice to quit in protest the day after that (though they didn't like any of the other couples anyway).
</li><li> Henry and Felicity had to go home in the eighth series, after Felicity became too ill to continue on the show. Gill and Pat quit just a few episodes later for the same reason, as they were both feeling unwell.
</li></ul></li><li> One contestant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CutthroatKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CutthroatKitchen">Cutthroat Kitchen</a></em> was removed from the contest by accidentally cutting off the tip of a finger (although given the sheer number of absurd things chefs on <em>CK</em> have to do it's honestly surprising it hasn't happened more often). The rule, it transpires, is that if a contestant leaves due to injury, all remaining participants go on to the next round - but the judge nominates their favourite dish, and that contestant's war chest is immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">refilled</a> to its original $25,000 US. The wounded contestant came back in a subsequent episode and won.
</li><li> On <em>Daisy of Love</em>, so many people left the competition that the users of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TelevisionWithoutPity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TelevisionWithoutPity">Television Without Pity</a> speculated that many of them were dropping out just to <em>get away</em> from Daisy.
<ul><li> Flipper left the house after getting in a heated argument with the rest of the cast.
</li><li> Brooklyn walked because he still had feelings for his ex-girlfriend.
</li><li> London refused to continue in the competition because he didn't think that he had a real connection with Daisy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He returned five episodes later and wound up winning.</span>
</li><li> Cage pulled himself out of the game because he feared he wouldn't be able to control his anger issues.
</li><li> Fox was thrown out when Daisy found out that he still had a girlfriend and was calling her from the house.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Dancing On Ice</em>:
<ul><li> Chesney Hawkes quit just before the start of the 2012 series due to an injury, and was replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">Chico Slimani</a>.

Instead, they combined that week's scores with the next week's to determine the next elimination.
</li><li> In Season 8, Misty May-Treanor tore her ACL in rehearsal and had to withdraw from the competition. The same season, Jewel had to withdraw before the competition began, throwing a monkey wrench into their promotions with her and her husband Ty Murray.
</li><li> In season 16, Dorothy Hamill was forced to drop out after dancing exacerbated a back injury to the point she risked being unable to walk or skate if she suffered further injury. Whether or not the decision to make the announcement at the last possible minute before the standard elimination would be announced was really a spur-of-the-moment decision, though, was never addressed.

</li><li> Jade Johnson pulled out after a knee injury.

He was counted as that episode's elimination and nobody else was sent home.
</li><li> Laney from season 5 left voluntarily, after making it to the top 5. In the show, her reason was mainly homesickness, but she later explains that <a class="urllink" href="http://ew.com/article/2013/10/24/face-off-exit-qa-i-honestly-dont-regret-the-decision-i-made/">she was feeling guilty about getting in the way of the other contestants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

A contestant named Nancy did this, but before she could actually start eating, she commented that her arm felt like it was burning. It was discovered that she was severely allergic to fish. The reaction was most likely caused by her scraping her arm against the fish's jaw, evident by the blood on her arm. It was deemed too risky for her to continue; the remaining female contestants did not have to worry about elimination for that round as a result (the men had gotten their turn already, with the slowest one eliminated as planned). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">One has to wonder how it could have played out if the meals were chosen through an entirely different method and she didn't find out until halfway through the dish, however...</a>

<ul><li> Jeff from Season 1. He stormed out after calling Gordon an asshole, and at the end of the episode, we were informed that Jeff decided not to return to Hell's Kitchen due to an injury. Not seen on TV was the confrontation after Jeff walked out, in which Jeff shoved Gordon, and Gordon shoved him back, knocking him down and twisting his ankle (not that there was any way Jeff would have returned after insulting Gordon, in any case).
</li><li> Larry from Season 2 had problems breathing, and the medical crew sent him to the hospital. The next day, he called the contestants and told them he was not coming back.
</li><li> Aaron from Season 3 had health problems since the start, and during a punishment, he collapsed on set, and was subsequently deemed unfit to continue on the show. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">He would pass away from complications of his diabetes in November of 2010.</a>
</li><li> Vanessa from Season 4 burned her hand on hot oil, putting it out of commission for the foreseeable future. She ended up leaving. (In a later interview, she revealed that she probably would've lost the use of that hand if not for being in an environment where she could get immediate medical attention.)
</li><li> Season 5:
<ul><li> Ji voluntarily left the show after the second episode due to an injured ankle. She could have stayed, but felt that she would not be able to perform. That episode, she had completed the entire dinner service while injured and without pain medication; Gordon was so impressed by her dedication that he allowed her to leave the show with her jacket as a trophy and reminder of her successes, the first such case he had ever done so.
</li><li> Robert left the show under a combination of evacuation and voluntarily quitting: he nearly had a heart attack on the show, and it was recommended that he leave by medical personnel. He had already been considering leaving due to the limitations of his weight; for example, he hadn't been allowed to go on a helicopter trip with his winning team. He returned in Season 6.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 6's Joseph, who displayed a horrible attitude (such as saying he didn't <em>want</em> the reward for winning a challenge since he came to cook and not to have fun), a hilariously short fuse, and an inability to obey the most basic of instructions, all this culminating in his tearing off his jacket, getting right up to Gordon's face, and asking if he wanted to "take this outside". Gordon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">never even raising his voice,</a> told Joseph that he had no respect and ordered him out. Despite his protestations about the bright future before him, all Joseph aspired to was a joke both amongst the contestants and the viewers.
</li><li> Andrew from Season 7 walked out midway through the second service after Gordon kicked him out.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03yh0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note03yh0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03yh0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> He had mixed runny mashed potatoes with a fresh batch, which Gordon didn't like. After Gordon called him out for it, Andrew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">disagreed with Gordon,</a> leading to his exit. </span>
</li><li> Antonia in Season 8 was removed from the show before even the first dinner service, due to being hospitalized after complaining about a migraine, then collapsing.
</li><li> Jason in Season 9 was also hospitalized before service, as he was having trouble breathing during prep due to dehydration. He returned in Season 12, and went on to finish second.
</li><li> Gina in Season 11 left in the third episode due to a "personal issue".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1vr1q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1vr1q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1vr1q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Gina's actual reason for leaving? She had gotten into an argument with fellow contestant Nedra the night before, and later thought that the rest of her team was plotting against her. </span>
</li><li> Season 12 had two of these:
<ul><li> Simone, who during the usual elimination ceremony, just flat out told Gordon that he should send her home, in part because she was feeling unwell. That said, there's a very good chance she would have been eliminated anyway that episode, as it was her second nomination in a row, her team-mates hated her, and she had done poorly in the service.
</li><li> Later that season, Joy walked out on the show in the third-to-last episode. She had made virtually zero mistakes throughout the entire season and was the overwhelming favorite to win by that point, but after she made a relatively small error (bringing up halibut before the garnish was ready), Gordon gave her a pretty mild rebuke, which somehow caused her to completely lose it and storm out of the kitchen — and the competition as a whole — there and then. Gordon even admitted that it was one of the most shocking moments he experienced in Hell's Kitchen.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 13:
<ul><li> Steve was forced to withdraw from the show midway through the season after badly injuring his knee during a punishment.
</li><li> Aaron decided he wanted to quit the competition because he felt it wouldn't further his goals in the long run. Gordon was shocked by his decision, but allowed him to leave, not before calling Aaron's choice "disappointing".
</li></ul></li><li> In Season 14, Bret suffered a slipped disc in the bathroom resulting in very bad back pain, forcing him out of Hell's Kitchen. He returned in Season 18 where he placed 3rd.
</li><li> Season 18 (Rookies vs. Veterans):
<ul><li> Chris revealed that he had suffered a serious injury nine months prior to coming onto the show, and in Episode 6, he felt he was entering a dark place again, forcing him to make a decision to walk out before service began.
</li><li> At the final four, Motto realized that he was needed back in Baton Rouge, and decided to leave in order to use the lessons he learned throughout the competition to help out the chefs there.
</li></ul></li><li> In late 2018, fans took notice of a 13th contestant named JR briefly seen in the Signature Dish Challenge in Season 3. While some people thought he might have departed like Melissa McNulty in <em>Survivor</em>, fellow Season 3 contestant Joanna revealed the truth months later. As it turns out, she met JR during the auditions, and told him about how she was moving out of a bad relationship and that her mentor led her to coming onto the show. However, JR <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">decided to spread lies and rumors that Joanna was sleeping with said mentor,</a> and on top of an already unprofessional attitude, made off-color remarks. This was apparently too much for the producers to handle, and they sent him home before the first dinner service, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">while removing any mention or appearance from him as best as they could.</a>

<ul><li> Season 2:
<ul><li> TJ was forced out of the competition early on due to aggravating an existing back injury during the flash challenge.
</li><li> The same season also saw a partial medical disqualification in the form of Tray, who'd admitted to the contestants (but not the judges) that he had not been taking his medication for high blood pressure and as a result, had developed some complications (including going blind in one eye). This caught up with him in the fifth episode where he collapsed in the loft while awaiting the judges decision. While he was cleared to return, the judges still eliminated him for turning in a poor quality tattoo.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 3:
<ul><li> Danger was eliminated in the third episode for not being able to turn in a tattoo at all. The reason? His client walked out on him just prior to the start of the tattooing session after the two of them got into a rather heated argument. The judges investigated and put it down to a personality clash, but also noted that an Ink master should be able to instill confidence in his client and he was unable to do so. He was eliminiated primarily for this, but also his poor quality tattoo during the flash challenge (while the other contestants were not judged on their flash challenge).
</li></ul></li><li> Season 4:
<ul><li> Ashley quit in the second episode after an emotional breakdown.
</li><li> Kyle was ejected in the eighth episode for physically assaulting one of the judges just before the flash challenge due to the amount of criticism that had received in judging over the previous two episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 5:
<ul><li> Joshua was disqualified in the eleventh episode for admitting to (non-medicinal) marijuana use during the competition, which was a breach of the rules set out in the contract. In an interesting turn of events, he openly admitted to the breach in front of the judges, who had no choice but to remove him from the competition.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 8:
<ul><li> Sketchylawyer quit the competition due to being unable to handle the criticism of the judges.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 11:
<ul><li> Oba withdrew from the competition for medical reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 12:

Performers are traditionally unmasked when they are eliminated, the Cockroach chose to be unmasked from outside the studio and was revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">singer Angelo Kelly</span>. The Cockroach also did not appear for that seasons finale, which had a group performance by all the contestants, regardless of if theyd been eliminated or not.

</li><li> In Season 2, Sarah quit after making the top 24, due to feeling that her heart was no longer in the competition.
</li><li> And just to make it a pattern, season 3's Paul withdrew due to "work commitments" having his spot taken in the top 24 by another contestant.

No reason was given for her elimination at the time other than "She broke the rules," leading to the "What happened to Willam?" controversy that wasn't answered until the Season 4 finale. However, several queens later said that the reason given for Willam's disqualification on the show (conjugal visits with her husband) was not the actual reason she was kicked off. Fast forward to the present, and there are still multiple conflicting theories as to why Willam left.
</li><li> Adore Delano voluntarily left during the second episode of <em>All Stars 2</em> after receiving extremely harsh critiques during the first episode and suffering from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> as a result.
</li><li> During Season 9, Eureka was asked to leave the competition for medical reasons due to a knee injury she had sustained a few episodes prior. In a happy subversion of the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGameplayElimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGameplayElimination">Non-Gameplay Elimination</a>, Eureka was given an open invitation from Ru to return and compete in Season 10. She ended up accepting this offer and made it to that season's Top 3.
</li><li> Starting with the second season, All Stars seasons of Drag Race play by different rules where the queens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VotedOffTheIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VotedOffTheIsland">eliminate each other</a> rather than Ru herself. On <em>All Stars 3</em> BenDeLaCreme chose to eliminate herself after winning the week's challenge, having decided she had gained all she stood to gain from the show and believing the other queens would do better with the title of winner than she would.
</li><li> Season 12: Sherry Pie is not eliminated, but is disqualified post facto after it comes out that she has a history of catfishing and exploiting aspiring actors for sexually explicit material. Sherry ended up making it to Top 4 of the season, but had her whole track record voided and was not invited to the reunion or finale. Additionally, the producers donated her challenge winnings to the Trevor Project, and the editing team worked their hardest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">cut her out of the show to the bare minimum</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>SAS: Are You Tough Enough?</em>: Somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as the whole point of the show is that SAS training is <em>supposed</em> to be so tough that most folk can't cope with it, but the second season is worthy of particular note as so many people quit or retired injured that it wasn't until the semi-final that the "normal" elimination procedure had to be brought into play at all. More amusingly, the very first episode of season one had contestants undertake an only moderately difficult walk in the Scottish mountains. Several contestants, including a former fitness champion, simply wandered off and went home.
</li><li> <em>A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila</em>:
<ul><li> Lala walked out during the second episode of the first season, as she felt that she was being set up and that Tila wasn't really interested in women. This ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> when it turned out that Tila actually wasn't into <em>men</em>, and dumped the season's winner apparently for that reason.
</li><li> Vanessa was ejected later in that season after physically assaulting Brandi. In turn, Brandi walked off the show; she later attempted to return, but the producers forbade her to do so.
</li><li> Serenity and Lily got thrown out of the first episode of Season 2 after admitting that they were more attracted to each other than they were attracted to Tila.
</li><li> Dominic was ejected in the third episode for homophobic remarks. To say the least, Tila was baffled at why he would say this on a show where at least <em>half</em> of the participants were either lesbian or bisexual.
</li><li> Chad was ejected for assaulting Bo in the fifth episode. However, in an inversion of what happened to Brandi in the previous season, Bo averted the trope and finished as runner-up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef">Top Chef</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Season 2, Cliff was disqualified (ejected) for, quote the show, "Aggressive Physical Content". He along with multiple contestants had planned to shave the head of Marcel, another contestant. Cliff was assigned to hold him down, which he did dutifully, but the others who planned the whole thing backed out of it. Cliff was then ejected for his conduct, and the others were given a strict warning. Based on the judges' comments, however, Cliff would likely have been eliminated anyway.
</li><li> Also from Season 2, Otto withdrew from the competition because of a mix-up involving unpaid ingredients during an elimination challenge. Howie from Season 3 attempted to withdraw, but the judges said it was not his decision to make, and they eliminated him anyway.
</li><li> Episode 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef">Top Chef</a>: Just Desserts</em> had two non-gameplay eliminations: first Seth was "evacuated" by the producers when (after several weeks of erratic behavior) he had a panic attack and collapsed during the prep for the Quick Fire challenge. Then Malika quit at Judges Table (while the guest judge was trying to tell her how much she enjoyed her dish!), saying that the stress from the competition was ruining her enjoyment of cooking.
</li><li> The first episode of <em>Masters</em> Season 4 has Missy leave the competition after cutting her finger deep enough to require extensive surgery (although she got an invitation for Season 5 out of it.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopShot">Top Shot</a></em>
<ul><li> In the first season, Tara left because her father was dying of cancer.
</li><li> In the second season, John had pulled both hamstrings; he left rather than be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">millstone</a> to his team.
</li><li> In the third season, Jake was railing against everyone involved since the first time he was sent to an Elimination Challenge. The <em>second</em> time he was sent to it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">he stormed out of the game</a>. Mike, who had gotten eliminated just before, took his place in the Elimination Challenge and won his way back into the game. Jake had previously attempted to invoke this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">trying to provoke Mike into hitting him</a>. It didn't work.
</li><li> Earlier in season three, Billy Rogers left because his wife was having complications with her pregnancy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Treasure Hunters</em> had this happen in the third episode when the team of grad students withdrew after one of them injured her ankle during the previous episode. As a result, the team eliminated in that episode returned only to be eliminated again in episode four.
</li><li> <em>True Beauty</em>
<ul><li> In Season 2, Regina was eliminated for breaking the show's rules by using a cell phone to contact her friends and risk jeopardizing the show's true intentions of gameplay into being exposed before the season aired. The judges revealed that out of the bottom two for that week (Liz and Taylor) Liz would've been sent home instead if Regina had not violated the rules.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Tough Love: New Orleans</em>
<ul><li> Tiffany was ejected from the show when it was revealed that, not only was she married, she had three kids that she hand't mentioned. And the dialogue suggests that she didn't even <em>tell</em> these people that she was leaving for New Orleans to join a reality show. Danielle also quit in the final episode when her ex-boyfriend was pretty definitive about never getting back together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEToughEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEToughEnough">WWE Tough Enough</a></em>
<ul><li> In Season 1, two participants quit simultaneously because they decided that they didn't "want it" as much as necessary. And they weren't the only ones eliminated in this fashion; Season 1 had more quitters and evacuations than actual cuts by the trainers.
</li><li> From season 3, contestant Lisa was removed from the competition after she had a psychotic breakdown and went on a rampage around town. The other contestants were told she decided wrestling wasn't the right career for her.
</li><li> Also in season 3, Jill quit because she couldn't take living with ex-boyfriend Jonah.
</li><li> Michelle Deighton from season 5 left in episode 3 because she couldn't handle being away from her daughter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">The X Factor</a></em> (UK)
<ul><li> Emily Nakanda was ejected from Series 3 after it emerged that just weeks before her first audition she had filmed herself assaulting a teenager and uploaded the footage to YouTube.
</li><li> Frankie Cocozza got ejected from Series 8 for boasting in front of several crewmembers that he had used illegal drugs (supposedly cocaine and cannabis) during filming.
</li><li> Lucy Spraggan withdrew from Series 9 after contracting a severe chest infection. She was allowed to sit out one week and was offered the chance to do the same the following week, but chose to withdraw due to a combination of the infection not clearing up, and her fellow competitors accusing her of getting preferential treatment.
</li><li> Brooks Way were one of the three groups to make it to 2016's live shows but made a No Show during the first Saturday show. It had come out just beforehand that one of the two members had allegedly engaged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">domestic violence</a> against his ex-girlfriend as well as his brother/band-mate. At ITV's suggestion the band withdrew from the competition which was announced the day after that week's elimination.
