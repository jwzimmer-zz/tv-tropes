</p><p>You'd think that saving the world on a semi-regular basis would give your sense of self-worth a bit of a boost, if not cause some serious ego issues. The parades in your honor, the best-selling biography by your most ardent fan (<em>Monster Slaying and Other Handy Household Hints</em>), the fact that the town hall's been renamed after you... surely you don't need anyone else to tell you that you're loved and needed, right?

</p><p>No matter how much they do for the world or what their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">loyal friends</a> tell them, they're still incapable of believing that they're anything more than useless. Every little mistake leads to a massive display about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">it's all their fault</a> and how they're just not good enough. Praise may lead only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismissingACompliment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismissingACompliment">Dismissing a Compliment</a>. They're being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">humble</a>... and it went too far. Sometimes <em>way</em> too far.
</p><p>Welcome to the world of Heroic Self-Deprecation. It doesn't matter how many lives they've saved, worlds they've rescued, or bad guys they've defeated—their self-esteem remains in negative figures and they'll still have a periodic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, rendered useless until someone can snap them out of it by telling them they're wonderful. And someone will. Because for every hero with terrible self-esteem there's a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> on standby to give them encouraging words and speeches, usually with at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">Get A Hold Of Yourself Man</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> especially are prone to giving speeches of thanks after this happens: she repays her squad by crediting her success to the supportive words of her friends and love interest.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">not always a bad thing</a>, this can get rather irritating, especially if the hero's exploits are so grandiose that nobody could fail to realize that they are A Very Important Person. Sometimes writers feel they're in a bind; wanting their hero to be modest but also wanting the audience to realize they're amazing. So they have the hero put themselves down incessantly to avoid bragging, while having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekChorus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekChorus">Greek Chorus</a> of their friends reminding us that just because they don't brag about it doesn't mean that they're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">the best thing since sliced bread</a>. This unfortunately breaks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">Show, Don't Tell</a> rule, which doesn't sit well with people. Especially if this trope is done so badly it veers into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> territory. However, this trope is quite more common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">cynical settings</a>, since bragging a character's heroic deeds can be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a>.

As long as you avoided <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">hubris</a></em>, this was fine; it showed generosity of spirit.
</p><p>While this trope tends to be associated with female characters, there are enough male examples so that it is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a>. Children and teenagers can be prone to this if they're thrown in at the deep end early in life, but young boys are more likely to be given a storyline where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">they get big headed and have to be brought down to earth</a>. Adult males are not immune, either; while bragging might be seen as less of a sin for men, and reversing it as less necessary, there will still be a few authors who use modesty as a virtue and go a bit too far.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt">Think Nothing of It</a>, which is reasonable self-deprecation; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">Dude, Where's My Respect?</a>, where a character with a lot of accomplishments is belittled by other people instead of by themself. If this mood is just a one-off thing for a character, then it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>. Contrast also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> (for someone who acts tough but is revealed to have low self esteem beneath all that), as well as pure Superiority Complexes: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill">Akame ga Kill!</a></em> Leone once outright tells Tatsumi that they aren't heroes, they're killers. The main thing that might qualify them as heroes is that the people they kill are far worse than they are.
</li><li> Edward Elric from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> easily qualifies. He's a child genius, one of the youngest and greatest alchemists ever to exist, but he blames himself for the loss of Alphonse's body, and even at the end of the series is still beating himself up over Nina being turned into a chimera by her father, despite having saved countless other people along the way.
</li><li> Hakuron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaouAiren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaouAiren">Haou Airen</a></em> keeps saying horrible things about himself and insists in telling Kurumi that he's a monster and she should reject him for such stuff, but that doesn't stop him from hugging her passionately and sexing her up. Many times, against her will.
</li><li> Hatsumi Narita from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick">Hot Gimmick</a></em> tends to put herself down quite a bit, feeling that she is weak and unable to vocalize her emotions. The fact that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBoyfriend">abusive boyfriend</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Ryoki</a> actively encourages this in her, by calling her "stupid", "dimwit", "birdbrain", and making her feel bad if her world doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">revolve around him</a>, doesn't help much.
</li><li> Takiko Okuda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugiGenbuKaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugiGenbuKaiden">Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden</a></em> has always seen herself as a weak, good-for-nothing girl, who was incapable of being remotely any help to the people closest to her, lamenting that she could not help her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">sick mother</a> and never managed to really get to know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">her father</a>. Even when she becomes the Priestess of Genbu and helps the warriors feel accepted and alright with their fate as her warriors, she still thinks she can't do much. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is said to be one reason why Genbu had such an easy time devouring her.</span>
</li><li> Maya Kitajima from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em> sees herself as plain-looking, boring, clumsy and good for nothing.
<ul><li> It helps that her mother kept telling her that, too, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until she died, realizing what a great kid Maya was, after all</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>: Lucy constantly puts herself down, because she was left alone at a young age and tormented in an orphanage by the other children for being "different." Later, she meets Kouta, and for the first time in her life she feels loved, only to kill his dad and sister when she thinks that he betrays her. She then realizes her mistake when she sees how upset Kouta is, feels immense guilt, and only keeps herself alive so that she can someday meet Kouta again and apologize to him.
</li><li> Tsuna Sawada from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>. Gets called "No-Good Tsuna" by his peers for his poor grades, athletic and social skills and doesn't exactly discourage these remarks directed towards him, even though, through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, he's become stronger, less of a wimp, and more able to protect his "family". In the beginning he was also more likely to insist that he wasn't capable to do anything mafia-wise without Reborn's help. However, it's also something that pisses Reborn off immensely, and is shown as something he'll have to get over eventually. So when Tsuna demonstrates even a tiny bit of self confidence, Reborn regards it as a vast improvement.
<ul><li> To be fair, Tsuna still is a no-good bump on a log unless he's in Dying Will mode, which despite apparently being offscreen and instant now, still requires either pills or a bullet to the noggin.
</li><li> Enma Kozato even more so. It's partly because of this that the two end up becoming fast friends because they finally found someone they can relate to in this regard.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, Zenitsu harbors some deep self-esteem issues from his past where he quite never found a group of friends he truly belonged to, feeling he was useless and then getting called as such after being abandoned by past acquaintances Zenitsu started to believe he really doesnt amount to anything as a person and only kept taking the path of the sword out of respect for his master and the waning hope that maybe someday someone will see him as their hero.
</li><li> Usagi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, but it's balanced out by the other cast members criticizing and pointing out her faults, especially early on.

Unfortunately, the fanbase continues to view Shinji as a complete pussy nontheless.
</li></ul></li><li> Asuka as well. Although she tries very hard to hide it by constantly acting confident, deep down she's a massive self-hating mess who is desperate for praise and validation from others.

It's implied he grew up in an unloving home with Yui Ikari being the light of his life when he married her. Upon her death, he pretty much becake a wrecked man. Rather than falling into the usual self-loathing, he channeled it into his plan to end the suffering he was forced to endure due to his humanity. Furthermore, he tried to distance himself from Shinji because he was afraid he would hurt his son. Ironically, this would be indeed how he would hurt his son, something he painfully acknowledges right before he dies. Like father, like son.
</li><li> Although he doesn't show it, it's revealed in an artbook (and in the manga version) that Kaji is a self-hating mess. In the manga, he describes himself as "someone who does not deserve to be happy" (which is the reason for his extremely dysfunctional relationship with Misato). Perhaps because of this, he tries his best to help out Shinji.

</li><li> Setsuna also gets some bouts of this after Tsukuyomi nearly defeats her.

The poor boy's been under the impression he's going to someday receive some horrible punishment just for having yelled at Athena when she was trying to kill him. He believes that everyone hates him, except children, though he doesn't think of children as being anything other than friends. He also doesn't feel that he's worthy of having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a> of gorgeous girls who worship the ground he walks on, due to what happened with Athena.
<ul><li> Actually, Hayate doesn't feel he deserves having a girlfriend because he can't financially support her...which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Albeit, this WAS beaten into his head by Athena, so it still counts. And ironically, she did it so that he would become independent from his parents, and agree to live with her, since the alternative to staying in her castle was rather terrifying, and she did condemn his naivety towards his parents. Overall, it's a cryptic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Yukinari Sasaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo">Girls Bravo</a></em> does this often.

</li><li> Yura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt">Honey Hunt</a></em> engages in this often, maintaining that she's "not beautiful" despite being very pretty when she fixes herself up, and that she's not cut out to be a actress. She also tends to blame herself whenever things go wrong, claiming that she's just being a burden on others and that she's "just no good".

Aside from Izaya's constant teasing, he talks down on himself for being so violent and loathing, because he believes that he has <em>no reason</em> to be. True in form, he had a loving family and a normal, happy life, until one day in third grade, when he was provoked...
</li><li> Also, Shizuo's issues with anger and being unable to control himself have pretty much shot his self-esteem to hell. It's bad enough that when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Saika declares its love for him</span>, he responds mostly with confusion  because he can't imagine <em>why</em> someone could love him.

</li><li> Miranda Lotto of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> often feels inferior and useless, partially because she was fired from all one hundred jobs she previously tried to work.

It also shows that while he genuinely is a breast man, by thinking of them near constantly he was able to keep his depression and self worth in check, Raynare's actions washed that away like a sand wall to a tsunami.</span>

He wonders if he would gain more attention in chapter 278 if he were to act more like America. He states that unlike him, America is good looking and a skilled speaker. He makes himself feel bad when thinking this way and his bear thinks "The real problem with him is that he's too self deprecating..."
</li><li> Tsukimi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish">Princess Jellyfish</a></em>. It's part of the reason she doesn't put effort into her appearance and she considers herself "gross". Kuranosuke and the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">think differently however</a>. She's so convinced that no one could ever be attracted to her that she goes out of her way to misinterpret even the most straightforward indications of love such as Shuu saying "I like you" or President Kai's kiss.
</li><li> Yuuri Katsuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce">Yuri!!! on Ice</a></em> refers to himself as a "dime-a-dozen" skater in the first episode, but, if you pause while he mentions this, the website containing his profile reveals that Yuuri is quite literally the poster boy for Japanese men's figure skating, and he is the top-ranked Japanese skater shown in the series. In general, he doesn't even necessarily see himself as an interesting or likable person, and for awhile is oblivious to the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his idol is desperately in love with him and literally everyone around him does admire and respect him</span>.

In <em>every</em> other aspect, however, she falters. When Houli confesses to her at the start of the story, she decries her own lack of feminine qualities to shoo him off, and is shown to be self-conscious about her scars. Much of the story revolves around her learning how to cope with life outside of battle, whether it be her developing relationship with Houli or just learning to enjoy sweets and spending time with friends.

Somewhat deconstructed in that this comes from serious PTSD and depression, and has led to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedSuicide">attempting suicide</a> at least twice.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered">Empowered</a></em> eats this trope for breakfast, with a title character who thinks she's a significantly worse superhero than she actually turns out to be.
<ul><li> The character of MindF**k from the same series is a different example of this, in that she views herself as being less purely good than she actually is because she had to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> herself into becoming a good person.</span> The fact that this made her into easily the most selfless character in the comic doesn't seem to have changed her opinion of herself.

Spidey may be world famous, but that's mostly from being painted as a menace by the media to the point where any action he takes leads to questions about his intentions. He's fought alongside many other heroes, and finally joined the Avengers after a long career which often saw him rejected outright due to his outlaw status. Spider-Man's whole career has been a double-edged sword that makes his self deprecation understandable and fairly realistic. Peter is a brilliant and powerful man, but he doesn't think he deserves to be treated like one.

Now you try to convince her of this. She has a rather low self-esteem and regards herself as an immature, clueless child who is barely worthy of bearing the S-shield. In <em>Good-Looking Corpse</em> she leads a team of young heroes and she is shocked when they praise her cleverness and leadership skills.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a> can fall into this at times. No matter how much good he does and regardless of how many times he's hailed in universe and out as being one of the world's greatest superheroes, he is often far more preoccupied with the things he <em>can't</em> or <em>doesn't</em> do than the things he can or does. One of the fundamental aspects of his character is the consistent awareness that no matter how powerful he is, he can't be everywhere at once and he can't save everyone. This doesn't stop him from feeling guilty anywayif he tries to protect a hundred, a thousand, or even a million lives from certain doom and manages to rescue all but one, it's almost certain that he will be far more regretful about that one life he failed than celebratory about the ones he saved.
<ul><li> Case in point: Superman played a pivotal role in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OurWorldsAtWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OurWorldsAtWar">defending Earth from Imperiex</a>, thus saving the entire multiverse from total destruction; instead of celebrating this victory, he instead opts to add black to his costume's symbol as a way to honor the lives of those who died in the warthe people he was unable to help.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em>: The eponymous character is probably the only person in the <em>Ciaphas Cain</em> series who thinks that he is not worthy to be called a <strong>HERO OF THE IMPERIUM</strong>. There's a mixture of reasons for this: partly, it's because he knows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt">brushing away compliments about his mighty reputation</a> will make him look heroic <em>and</em> modest to boot, partly that the vital contributions of his aide Jurgen are always overlooked and Cain gets all the credit, and partly because he really feels he doesn't deserve to celebrated as such a hero when was he only ever trying to save his own skin (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">or so he says</a>).
<ul><li> It should be noted that the series is, in-universe, edited by his comrade in arms, who added extensive annotations on when Cain's narration missed important details- or when she felt he was being too tough on himself. It's up to the reader to decide who's interpretation is correct, although Amberley Vail was not the kind to soften facts, and Cain's culture is very focused on martyrdom.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> on occasion, for example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em>:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Hermione:</strong> ...I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've <em>done!</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harry:</strong> How d'you mean?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Ron:</strong> (sarcastically) Uh... first year- you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who-
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harry:</strong> But that was luck, that wasn't skill-
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Ron:</strong> Second year- you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle- Third year, you fought off about a hundred dementors at once.... last year, you fought off You-Know-Who again-
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harry:</strong> ...But I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts... I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing-
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> This is a bit ironic, as Harry also falls under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyReward">Dude Where's My Reward?</a> trope in the same book.
<ul><li> That one is more due to the fact that, after having seen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cedric Diggory's death and Voldemort's resurrection</span>, he isn't told anything about Voldemort, which he feels is important because Voldemort is trying to kill him personally. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And he is proven correct later in the book, by Dumbledore nonetheless, when he says that he has just realized that, by not telling Harry what he should have known earlier believing he was protecting him, he only made things worse.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Harry's playing down of his own competence is probably justified, as he is already well aware that he's the centre of a 14 year old reputation built on a deed he didn't actually perform himself. The last thing he wants the other students to believe is that he can pull an unbeatable solution out of his arse every time or teach them to do the same, because he knows it could get them killed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And sure enough, Colin Creevey, one of his biggest fans, dies in the last book, and it hits Harry "like a punch in the gut". Then again, Colin knew the score: he'd had to go out of his way to evade McGonagall and sneak back to fight. What Harry couldn't comprehend was just how determined the whole school was to make a stand; if McGonagall hadn't ordered them out, <em>everyone</em> would have stayed to fight.</span>
</li><li> Also, a big theme in Ron Weasley's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> is feeling inferior and unskilled in relation to Harry and Hermione, as well as his brothers, which more than once mixes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy">Driven by Envy</a>. Ron feels that he's not really good at anything, and even if he was, either his friends or his siblings could have done whatever he can but better. Reading between the lines, Ron's not an idiot, has a certain amount of intuition his two friends often lack, and he's a world-class chess player. The guy just never gives himself enough credit until character development kicks in, and it's during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> that Ron decides now really isn't the time to be down on himself.
</li><li> Sirius apologizes to Remus for suspecting him for being the traitor, when in retrospect the actual traitor was more psychologically consistent to do so, and even admits that he and James used to be "the biggest bullies in the playground" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">third book</a>, before the revelations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">fifth book</a>. He also acknowledges to Harry that he and James behaved, "like arrogant berks" and that they ought to have listened to Remus more often than they did.
</li><li> During <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what would be his last conversation with Harry</span>, Dumbledore also shows a hefty amount of self deprecation. He lays bare all of the mistakes of his youth that drove him to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>, explains that he never sought a government position because he didn't think he could be trusted with more power, and apologizes to Harry for manipulating him in the fight against Voldemort. Dumbledore admits that Harry is the better man and that everything would have gone smoother if Dumbledore had put more faith in him. Harry being Harry, he reassures Dumbledore that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>.
</li><li> One can argue that J.K. Rowling handles this trope quite well: Harry self-deprecates because he's thrust into the position of the most important person in the world <em>before he's even done growing up</em>.
</li><li> And Dumbledore was traumatized by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of his sister</span> and blames himself for it.
</li></ul></li><li> Ann from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GemmaDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GemmaDoyle">Gemma Doyle</a></em> trilogy is not a fan of herself. This is to the point of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> self-harm</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a>:</em> Percy sways between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">Humble Hero</a>, depending upon the quality of his mental state. It's particularly noticeable in <em>The Mark of Athena</em>, when, after numerous successful quests, life-saving, and <em>world-saving</em> at one point, he still feels he's misleading people by letting them think he's powerful or a good person. It's to the point of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and may have a Watsonian explanation: the first book makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">painfully clear</a> that Percy's stepfather's abuse and his birth father's abandonment caused his self-image to take a hit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, sadly-most abuse survivors are highly insecure and slow to trust anyone who compliments them or claims to love them.
</li><li> Flashman acts this way when anyone is looking, though in his case it's an utterly cynical ploy to boost his reputation as an innocent-hearted hero. There is also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> that Flashman is <em>genuinely</em> brave ("heroic" is not a word that can be used of a self-confessed rapist, murderer and slave-trader) but doesn't admit it to himself - if the definition of brave is "feel the fear and do it anyway" then Flashman is pretty much the poster child: he charged with the Light Brigade, fought on <em>both</em> sides of the US Civil War, took part in almost every major battle of the Indian Mutiny and stood beside Custer in his Last Stand... all while quaking in his boots with terror.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnolaHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnolaHolmes">Enola Holmes</a> is like this in the beginning, having grown up with the usual Victorian Age denigration of women and thinks she's stupid and ugly. However, this is eventually averted when she realizes that she is good looking at least as part of her disguises and the simple fact that any 14 year old girl who can keep one step ahead of her brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, and operate a successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">Private Detective</a> business at the same time is a bloody genius!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>' eponymous protagonist is this... probably. Nearly every chapter in the story is narrated from his perspective, so we really can't tell. Other characters say that they believe he has deep, unwarranted self-esteem issues, but they aren't privy to Harry's inner thoughts, as he points out. He does many bad things in the books, as well as good things, and it's ultimately the reader's decision exactly where he falls on the antihero scale.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rashid:</strong> You don't need help, Dresden. You <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">are</a></em> the help. <br/><strong>Harry:</strong> We're in trouble.

This transforms him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight">Failure Knight</a> who goes to insane risks to protect his adoptive brother and the rest of his friends. Yet despite this, he never thinks it's enough, regards himself as a failure, and just wants it to all end.
</li><li> In the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> by Matt Stover, the only person in the galaxy who doesn't believe Obi-Wan Kenobi is one of the greatest Jedi Masters of his time is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LukeSkywalkerAndTheShadowsOfMindor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LukeSkywalkerAndTheShadowsOfMindor">Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor</a></em>, Luke is so disgusted by his actions at the Battle of Mindor that he tries to have himself indicted for <em>war crimes</em>. It doesn't quite go as he wanted.
</li><li> After the first book in <em>The Bitterbynde Trilogy,</em> the main character, Imrhien, runs into this trope, especially as other people tell her she's beautiful, and she can't comprehend it. Justified, as she spent the entire first book with a hideously deformed face, and was treated cruelly on account of it, and that, combined with her amnesia, formed her entire self-image.
</li><li> Nadreck of Palain VII, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> universe, is the epitome of this trope. He's just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taken down three near-impregnable enemy battle-fortresses by telepathically manipulating their crews into going insane and killing each other</span>, but he tells his colleagues it's the worst performance he's ever put in since he was a child, solely because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the three commanders survived and he was obliged to kill them himself.</span> He almost resigns his commission when asked to divulge the details. Self-deprecation is a psychological trait of his entire species stretching back centuries, and it's documented in him when his character is first introduced, but he takes it to extremes here.
</li><li> Lilac from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfFearAndFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfFearAndFaith">Of Fear and Faith</a></em> doesn't usually have good things to say about herself, not helped by the voice of her mother inside her head berating her constantly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Phenix</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight">August</a> are also very hard on themselves.
</li><li> This is, naturally, big in Victorian literature. Perhaps the most extreme example is Esther, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BleakHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BleakHouse">Bleak House</a></em>, queen of Dickens' saintly female protagonists. The novel is split between omniscient third-person narration and Esther's first person view - and every second line of the woman's narration is pathological self-deprecation. As critics have pointed out, the extremity leaves an odd effect: since Dickens also requires the character to be a mouthpiece for Dickens' sharp, sometimes barbed, observations about characters, she comes across as passive-aggressive. It also makes her relationship with some of the other characters seem a little... unhealthy. For instance, she is not merely fond of her friend Ada, she is morbidly and self-abasingly obsessed with her. The most recent BBC adaptation to give Esther a complete personality rewrite to make her bearable to a modern audience: they endowed her with a sense of humour and replaced her hysterical self-loathing with a more likable mix of confidence and humbleness.
</li><li> Lu, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Murderess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Murderess">Murderess</a></em>, suffers from this, even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">heroically saving Hallwad and Aucasis from the Dark Ones tunnels</span>.
</li><li> The majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineAnderson">Catherine Anderson</a>'s heroines. They're convinced they're completely worthless and that no man would ever want them for whatever reason but the hero's point of view makes sure the readers know how beautiful and special these women are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries">Dora Wilk Series</a></em> has Witkacy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">The Stoner</a> who turned in his car keys and service weapon because he's confident that one day he'd kill somebody when high. That's all while Dora claims that even stoned, he's more intelligent than half of officers on their station and she trusts him implicitly to watch her back when heading right into danger.
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EdenGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EdenGreen">Eden Green</a></em> is bent on scientifically studying the alien symbiote infecting her friend  but never misses an opportunity to joke at her own expense, and confesses that she's unable to take herself seriously.

<ul><li> Iseult is made of this trope. Despite saving everyone's life on countless occasions, she keeps on underestimating herself, thinking that she's unimportant and merely a small addition to the main treasure that is Safi. She keeps on thinking that her mother and her apprentice are both better Theadwitches, and Iseult is to be blamed for this. She doubt herself all the time, and punishes herself in her head when she dares to dream about a better future of herself.
</li><li> Vivia is a badass and a capable princess, yet she keeps on thinking that the person she's in love with doesn't deserve her and will never notice her in any way other than a friend.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiritThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiritThief">The Spirit Thief</a></em>, despite being the most powerful of the three main characters and a good friend to both Josef and Eli, Nico believes herself to be next to useless and even goes as far as to have suicidal thoughts from time to time.

When Washington tries to hire him as his "Right Hand Man" in the song of the same name, Hamilton nearly refuses, preferring to fight on the front lines, and as seen in "The Story of Tonight - Reprise", he'd still much rather be fighting instead of working for Washington, where he arguably is doing more positive work. His wife eventually tells him that simply being there for her and their unborn son would be enough, and in "Yorktown", he takes that advice to heart, marking the end of his Heroic Self Deprecation.

In <em>New Mystery of the Emblem</em>, this is explored further. His base conversations with the Avatar show that it's partly due to his appearance, as he believes he is too baby-faced to be taken seriously, and tries to change the way he talks and even considers growing a beard to look more imposing.
</li><li> Lowen the Cavalier from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Fire Emblem 7</a></em> is sweet, a great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamChef">Team Chef</a>, has great potential as a cavalier (and pretty good growths in-game, unless you count magic defense) and works damn hard to get the work done... but he's got crippling self-esteem problems and several supports with others (his boss Marcus, his mentor Harken and his potential girlfriend Rebecca) have him saying he's just a nuisance and a load in the group.

He generally hides it well under his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">extroverted and cheery demeanor</a>, but a few of his supports, mainly his one with Rath, show that he actually has a lot of self-doubt and has a tendency to compare himself unfavorably to others.

He's a talented archer and Roy greatly values both his friendship and skill, but Wolt still sees himself as being weak and nothing but a hindrance to him.

This seems to be a recurring trait of archers in the series in general, and Takumi may be the most extreme example yet. In both the <em>Birthright</em> and <em>Conquest</em> routes, he is shown to have a <em>severe</em> inferiority complex. He believes that his archery skills are simply due to his special bow, and actually seems to think that his family doesn't truly love him, and this is unfortunately used against him by antagonists in <em>both</em> routes.

While it turned out badly and was perhaps inadvisable, he sees his willingness to ignore his own feelings for the benefit of his love, Lucrecia, as his greatest mistake since he 'allowed' her to walk into danger.

He's <em>incredibly</em> smart, he rarely loses (and if he does, he goes back for a rematch armed with knowledge of how to beat his opponents), he has a utility belt packed full of holdouts useful for any situation, his disruption-light tactic can <em>turn Exemplars into monsters</em>, his knowledge of economics is so good that he's a multi-billionaire before he's sixteen, and his powers can get him through almost any fight.

</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> falls into this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BatmanTheAnimatedSeriesE49IAmTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BatmanTheAnimatedSeriesE49IAmTheNight">one episode</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">the Dini-Timm cartoon</a>, when Commissioner Gordon is wounded during a police bust. Batman bitterly reproaches himself for his failure, thinking he does more to help merchandise salesmen than the people who really need it. This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Robin, who points out that Gordon is fully aware of the dangers of his job, and tries to remind Batman that Gotham would probably have fallen apart without him. Eventually, it's subverted when a disgusted Robin gives up trying to cheer up Batman and goes to the hospital to protect Gordon, since the mobster they busted has escaped from prison and is probably going to pay the Commissioner a "visit". Subverted again when Batman snaps himself out of his depression and goes to the hospital himself. The mob boss tries to whack Gordon, and runs into Batman...

Discord starts mocking her about how weak and useless she is, expecting her to get riled up and protest about how her kindness has done so much good... but instead, her self-esteem is so crappy she <em>agrees</em> with him wholeheartedly, and starts talking about how grateful she is to have friends who are willing to help her so much because she's good for so little, despite the fact that this is the pony who walked up to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">raging manticore</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaringDownCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaringDownCthulhu">made a dragon cry</a>, and stared down a cockatrice that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turning her to stone</a> at the time, among other things in season 1 alone. Just when it looks like she's off the hook, Discord loses his patience and corrupts her by sheer brute force.
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle also has shades of this, particularly in "Boast Busters;" she's afraid of defeating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> character in a magical contest simply because she doesn't want others to think she's showing off.

Occasionally subverted (and frequently lampshaded) in that she sometimes tends to boast about her skills; her personal motto is "I can do anything"; which is the slogan for her website.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ron</strong>: Sounds kinda braggy, KP. <br/><strong>Kim</strong>: It's like advertising, Ron, it's supposed to be braggy.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Pearl</a> suffers from this <em>big time</em> due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Homeworld's treatment of Pearls as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace">Servant Race</a></span>. This inherently low self-image coupled with and informing her unhealthy devotion to Rose Quartz has led to some fairly self-destructive behavior, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tricking Garnet into fusing with her so she could experience Garnet's strength and stability</span>. In "Friend Ship" she outright stated that because she's "just a Pearl", she doesn't have any inherent value and is only useful when someone gives her orders to follow. This is all in spite of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilkHidingSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilkHidingSteel">master swordswoman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">mechanical engineer</a>, and having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Rose Quartz's second-in-command during the Rebellion</a>. Thanks to Garnet's urging towards self-determination, she is getting better.
</li><li> Steven and Amethyst suffer from this as well. Steven doesn't think he's strong enough to replace his mother as leader of the team, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he suffers from massive guilt over his failure to help/reconcile with Jasper, Eyeball, and Bismuth</span>. Amethyst, despite being the strongest non-fusion of the team, and being the one who loves Earth the most because it's her native home, believes she's inherently bad because she was made in the Earth Kindergarten to be a Homeworld soldier during the Rebellion, and only avoided that by hatching 500 years behind schedule. Smoky Quartz, as Steven and Amethyst's fusion, shares similar self-esteem issues due to not having any apparent special abilities like the other fusions beyond their yo-yo weapon (they haven't existed long enough to properly explore their powers).
</li><li> As a result of her actions and mistakes caused by her ignorance and inability to completely learn from them, Rose Quartz is implied to have been heavily burdened by extremely low self-esteem. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She feels not good enough for Homeworld because the Diamonds' abuse towards her former identity for her compassion towards lesser beings made her feel worthless. And then she tries to improve herself by colonizing Earth (which requires in leaving behind her childhood, including her playmate Spinel), only to learn the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a> behind the process, which adds to her self-loathing (and also implies that she regrets leaving Spinel behind but couldn't come back for her because she believes Spinel deserves better than her, unaware that she was still waiting for her). She tries to atone for her mistakes by fighting against the Authority to save her planet, even faking her own shattering, since she believed they loved her only as a Diamond and just to feel better about themselves, only to realize far too late they did love her as a person and responded to her "death" by Corrupting all remaining Gems on Earth, which she barely saved Garnet and Pearl from</span>. She even feels not good enough for Earth and believes she doesn't deserve to be loved by her friends and family due to her failure to save the rest of them, blaming herself for the corrupted Gems.

<ul><li> Nobel Prize in Economics. And not just his game theory but many other breakthroughs in economics are attributed in large part to his revolutionary papers. However, Heroic Self-Deprecation <em>does</em> actually apply to him. His schizophrenia was composed of two states: one where he believed he was on a vast and important quest of the highest importance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">chosen</a> by aliens to change the political fabric of the world, and become the first World Citizen; and one where he was less than nothing, a distorted and worthless shadow of a human being. Having these two opposite and somewhat mutually exclusive mindsets constantly warring for dominance was <em>not</em> healthy, and did not turn out well.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> English novelist Thomas Hardy, despite achieving fame and success in his 30s, had constant doubts about his literary talent, to the extent that following bad reviews for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudeTheObscure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudeTheObscure">Jude the Obscure</a></em> he gave up writing fiction altogether and didn't write another novel for the last 30 years of his life.

In a autobiographical work of his, <em>My Confession</em>, he mentions that he had recurring bouts of depression despite having what many would call a happy life: he had a beloved wife; good children; a large estate "which grew and increased without any labour on [his] part"; was respected and praised by friends, neighbours, and strangers alike; and was mentally and physically well (excluding his depression). Why was he depressed? Because he was wondering if life was even worth living. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestoredMyFaithInHumanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestoredMyFaithInHumanity">In the end, he concluded that it was.</a>
</li><li> Keith Emerson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a></em> was arguably the most influential keyboardist of the 1970s, and the people who met him have almost universally described him as "humble". But those who were very close to him - particularly his former bandmates - have said things that make it look a little bit less like a healthy humility, and more like a very genuine problem with self image. According to both Lake and Palmer, he would focus on negative reviews, really letting them mess with his head, and by the mid 70s he had fallen into a very serious depression. Palmer said, once, that he'd casually mentioned that the band he was in was "too good for me". According to a statement Emerson himself made in the 90s, he had been reduced to a "state of panic" when he realized that people were actually analyzing his work. He was apparently taking anti-depressants later in life, and tragically committed suicide in 2016.
</li><li> Just about any serviceman or woman decorated for valor, especially those with the highest commendations (Medal of Honor, Victoria Cross, etc) will often dismiss the honor as being decorated "for just doing my job".
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a cognitive bias that explains both this trope and its inverse (dumb people thinking they are actually pretty good). In effect, if you are competent, you tend to assume other people are about as knowledgeable as you are, so you underestimate your own talent. And if you aren't, you think you're actually pretty good at something without so much as scratching the surface.
<ul><li> This may be why Babe Ruth is often credited with popularizing the "aw, anybody could have done it" attitude. Considering his background and (especially) the team he played for, it's no wonder he believed this.

When pressed, they put their accomplishments down as luck, coincidence, or the skill of someone else. They're convinced that any recognition and success they have achieved is undeserved, and that they're just frauds waiting to be found out.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA8XiC3m7vw">Amanda Palmer dubbed this mindset as "The Fraud Police"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an imaginary police force in your mind that you expect to show up at your door any day now and arrest you for being a fraud. The video is a commencement speech in which she gives some amazing advice on how to deal with the "fraud police," which Palmer says everyone will get a visit from at some point in their life, no matter who they are or how successful they've become. The whole speech carries an air of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>" due to this, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">if everyone experiences such a thing at some point in their life, surely you can't be alone in feeling that way</a>.

While we usually think of kids as blaming their bad deeds on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a>, some kids actually "blame" one for their <em>achievements</em>.

</div><ul><li> Various works have been done on the gender difference involved in this: in general, young boys were found to be much more likely to accept the credit due when they were praised, but young girls were more likely to play down their achievements or claim that someone else helped them. This has led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVersusNurture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVersusNurture">Nature vs. Nurture</a> debate: are most girls naturally more modest and boys more assertive, or does society train boys to assert themselves (to the point of boasting), while teaching girls that "it's not nice to brag" and that they should "share" credit for their achievements?
