<ul><li> Team Rocket in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> (less so in the games), of which we only see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">two human idiots and Meowth</a>, the beleaguered boss, and the rival group of agents. This gets subverted in the movies and some more dramatic episodes, when Team Rocket show themselves to actually be the large, well-equipped criminal organization that Jessie and James are ruining the reputation of. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> goes that the main reason they keep the trio around is to provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>. In the games, it's a genuinely threatening and large organization. Later seasons of the show have them become more competent, at one point working directly under Giovanni or his scientist Dr. Zager, but eventually theyre back on their own.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, the Spirit Worlds's cleanup squad for when things go wrong consists of one detective and any friends he might make along the way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though this is rendered a bit moot by the manga's ending, where it was revealed that Yusuke might not have been needed as badly as we originally thought.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> may count as a parody. ACROSS consists of Il Palazzo, Excel, and Hyatt, but has grandiose ambitions and a huge meeting area. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">The anime</a>, however, included a higher authority (all of one guy who's apparently cloned himself six times plus a stunt double); they send a messenger to tell Il Palazzo that he's not doing his job right.
<ul><li> In the manga, there may not be a higher power, but the organization <em>is</em> larger. They have a third "enforcer" type, Elgala.
<ul><li> Excel suspects there are others working for ACROSS behind the scenes, for example, to gather the various creatures in the pit. This probably isn't true.
</li><li> They eventually get a large workforce of people who are unaware of the organization's long-term goals and are just working for a paycheck. They don't seem to participate in any of the organization's inner workings.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> organization's combatants are pretty much just Alucard, Seras and Walter (Seras is basically still in training, and Walter is <em>for the most part</em> retired). Other than them, there's only their leader Integra, a dozen or so people in the round table conference, and a small squad of hired French mercenaries.
<ul><li> This was not always the case. Though small, Hellsing employed over a hundred people, all of whom were killed in about a single chapter of the manga and one episode (episode II) of the OVA by the Valentine brothers. The French "Wild Geese" mercenaries were hired specifically to replace the losses from that attack.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger">Not that they actually need more than one combatant if the one is</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Alucard</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> subverts this. From the beginning, the group that turns into the Black Knights is shown as a small terrorist cell. When the Black Knights grow, you see how much they've grown (as they get a submarine as well as many more members). They end up as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the official military force of most of the world</span>.
</li><li> The protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em> appear to <em>work</em> for one. There are only a handful of Kritiker agents the team don't already know about, and most of them have distressingly short life expectancies. Their opposite numbers are rather better staffed, but most of their evil plans <em>still</em> appear to rely on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> with a nasty case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has the Akatsuki, a sinister organization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak">Black Cloaks</a> with only 10 members (actually 9, since Orochimaru absconded with their membership ring). They seem to find replacements for lost members pretty quickly, but they <em>never</em> send out minions to do things, instead sending out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDuo">two of their number</a> to accomplish any task. Even their <em>accountant</em> is a powerful fighter and formal member of the organization - apparently they don't trust weaklings with money or something. Made worse by the fact that many of their members are constantly having arguments and trying to kill each other.
<ul><li> Sasori actually had several agents working under him, including (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kabuto and the two men who were turned into duplicates of Kisame and Itachi</span>), Pain had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a small <em>country</em></span> at his disposal, and Kakuzu had numerous ties to collect the money for the organization. Orochimaru also might have already established the Hidden Sound Village <em>before</em> he quit. So while they have a limited number of full members, they certainly are able to have their own henchmen, widening their potential scope considerably. Still, they seem to handle most of their affairs personally, though it doesn't hurt that the combined power of the Tailed Beasts they're capturing would give them enough firepower to demolish entire nations.
</li><li> Akatsuki's status as this is fully averted in the Shinobi World War arc; Tobi fields an army of 100,000 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> White Zetsus, which are supplemented with an army of legendary ninjas resurrected by Kabuto</span>.
</li><li> This also originally applied to most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">clans</a> of Konoha, besides the Uchiha and Hyūga, until the Invasion of Pain arc and those following it, where we saw members of the Akimichi, Nara, Yamanaka, Aburame, Sarutobi, and (maybe) Inuzaka clans who were <em>not</em> directly related to the main cast, some of whom have provided vital combat support to the main cast in the Fourth Shinobi World War.
</li><li> Also, the Konoha council that advises the Hokage currently consists of two elders, though there might be more members than what we normally see; when the village thinks it needs to appoint a new Hokage, the group assembled also included the Fire Daimyo and his advisors/nobles, plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Danzo</a>, Jōnin Commander Shikaku Nara and someone from ANBU.
</li></ul></li><li> There are two examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>; both are probably justified. First, L's task force consists of himself, Watari, five of the main police officers and later, Light. The original organization had quite a lot more members, but they were afraid for their lives, what with the whole Kira thing, and L did not want to reveal his face to a large group of people. The second, the SPK, also started off with a lot of members, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mello offed all but Near and three smart enough not to reveal their true names to Mello's mole</span>, which kind of put a damper on things.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchCredits">Bait-and-Switch Credits</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueSeed">Blue Seed</a></em> seems to indicate that the Terrestrial Administration Center has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHelicopter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHelicopter">Black Helicopter</a> fleet and a navy, among other things. Some episodes, they seem to only have couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack">The Men in Black</a>, a van, and one women with a bazooka.
</li><li> Likewise, despite being very well financed in the original <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gatekeepers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gatekeepers">Gatekeepers</a></em>, AEGIS was supposedly a worldwide organization; with Japan being just the Eastern outpost. By the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> sequel, there was about 5 members left, though given the mood of the sequel that may be more a case of things getting worse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>
<ul><li> The Doma organization in Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> apparently consists at the beginning of the season of Dartz, Rafael, Amelda/Alister, Varon/Valon, Grimo/Grerimo and, at one point, Mai, and no-one else. Haga/Weevil and Ryuzaki/Rex were briefly members, but they didn't last long. <em>And</em> its members lose their souls one at a time over the course of the season.
</li><li> Before, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Noah</a> and his (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually Gozaburo's</span>) group, the Big Five.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kagemaru</a> and the Seven Stars Assassins (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Seven Shadow Riders</a> in the Dub). It doesn't help that they have two incompetent and harmless members and another member who isn't that strong.
</li><li> The Dark Signers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> are five duelists. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then Bommer/Greiger joins them after Devack lost to the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Twins</a>, but he loses to Crow who <em>wasn't</em> even a Signer at that time.

</li><li> Greed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is pretty vocal about wanting absolutely everything in the world for himself, yet he NEVER gets more than a handful of followers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This turns out to be for a reason: what he desires is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">something else</a>.</span>
</li><li> In the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> film, NERV seems to consist entirely of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Gendo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere">Fuyutsuki</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Rei</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Kaworu</a>, with the majority of the operation being automated</span>. To be fair, the only people in the world at this point either work <em>for</em> NERV, or work on the AAA Wunder and try to <em>destroy</em> NERV.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> franchise seems to play this straight. In the Manga, there was implied to be a large number of additional people working for the Lupin family, and the film even says that they're an extremely large organization. Mooks were featured in a few Green Jacket episodes, but from Red Jacket onwards, the "Lupin Empire" seems to contain only 3 or 4 people, depending upon Fujiko's interests, with the occasional hired help. The perpetual crew always outnumbers the "empire" characters, even when it would make sense to gather more help.
<ul><li> While some franchise entries like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a> show Zenigata leading a squad of police, more often he's working the Lupin case alone or with whatever cooperation he's able to wrangle out of local law enforcement. One wonders if the real reason he can't catch Lupin is that it's one against four.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em>, the World Destruction Committee consists entirely of two people and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">teddy bear</a>; Before the second half of the first episode, it was only one angry human woman. Admittedly, it was a name that her enemies made up to demonize her, but she ran with it because it's intimidating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Soul Society seems to be made up of only a couple thousand shinigami, with just a few dozen of them being capable of fighting the higher level hollows and arrancar. The numbers seem downright bizarre when one considers that they're the only known force that maintains the balance of souls throughout the entire world.
</li><li> The Royal Guards have even fewer members than Soul Society's Gotei 13. They are composed of five ex-Captains, one of whom commands a separate squad. Their job is to protect the Soul King, basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Barrier Maiden</a> that keeps the world intact. It's stated at one point that they do not need numbers, since the combined forces of the Royal Guards are more powerful than the entirety of Gotei 13 put together.
</li><li> Aizen's "army" of arrancar doesn't even seem to reach triple digits, since 100 and higher are apparently reserved for the Privaron Espada, the former members of Aizen's elite Espada group. When he shows up to fight Gotei 13 in Fake Karakura, he has only 17 combatants on his side- himself, Tosen and Gin, the top three Espadas, ten Fracciones, and Wonderweiss.
</li><li> Zigzagged in the final arc with Yhwach and the Wandenreich. His main army, the Stern Ritter, consists of twenty-six members, one for each letter of the alphabet. This may seem small, but it actually outnumbers the thirteen Captains of Soul Society...and then we see that he seemingly also has countless Soldat<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06675');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06675" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06675');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">German for "soldiers"</span> at his disposal, though very few of said Soldat actually appear, and only in situations where the main army's members are not present. Not that this inconveniences Yhwach by much, though: not only are his Stern Ritter very powerful, Yhwach himself is also far stronger than any previously introduced antagonist.
<ul><li> Yhwach also has the excuse that the more he spreads his power around, the weaker he personally is, so having fewer fighters works for him.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, Celestial Being at first appears to be this, consisting solely of 4 pilots, 6 crew members on their space ship, a supercomputer and <em>a man who's been dead for 200 years</em>, whom the media report as being the group's leader. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We later learn that Celestial Being is actually a surprisingly large, secret organization, with <em>at least</em> three separate groups working against each other <em>within</em> the organization!</span>

It starts out larger, but Freeza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">wipes them out</a> for failing to kill any of Earth's fighters when he invades.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, Sir Nighteye's hero agency consists of himself, two sidekicks- Centipeder and Bubble Girl- and his intern and protege Mirio. Despite taking on Midoriya as an intern during the Internship arc, Nighteye has no desire to increase the size of his organization. By the end of the arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nighteye is dead, Mirio has lost his quirk and Midoriya returns to school</span>, leaving the agency down to <em>two people</em>.

And despite the fact that there have been members other than the original Four over the years, they never last long, and the original roster always returns. (Given that they are supposed to be as much a family as they are a team, most writers wouldn't have it any other way.) Of the original roster, two of them are <em>literally</em> family: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman">Sue Storm</a> and her brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HumanTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HumanTorch">Johnny</a>.

In Grimm's case, he has been depicted as Reed's closest friend since they were in college together, and as having an unrequited affection for Sue. The Richards kids treat him as an honorary uncle.
</li><li> The Hellfire Club in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>.

Somewhat justified in that the X-Men are usually facing the Inner Circle of the club; the regular members are just normal but extremely wealthy members of society. This is how Archangel (who much later declined an invitation to the Inner Circle), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> and Candy Southern got their membership.

The exact numbers vary over the course of the series but there are thousands of citizens for each judge at any given time.

The problem is that the Trust isn't just supposed to be a large crime syndicate, it's supposed to be an ungodly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> that pervades every aspect of government and crime in the North American continent.

Though they are mentioned to have agents and informants around.
<ul><li> This is also true of the Autobots and Decepticons in many continuities, where both factions tend to be represented by rather small teams, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">a couple of new characters trickling in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">as new toys come out.</a> In the G1 cartoon, Shockwave seemed to be the sole Decepticon on Cybertron bar a couple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> comic featured at most ten non-Minicon characters working for either faction.
</li><li> In an odd example of this, the Japan-original Decepticon Black Shadow had his function translated as "Space Mafia" rather than the more accurate "Space Gangster." This led to him picking up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">a cult fanbase</a> by virtue of the fanon idea that there was apparently an entire unseen Space Mafia out there, of which Black Shadow was the only member ever seen. The common interpretation of this (that Black Shadow was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> sufficient to act as the <em>entire</em> Space Mafia) even influenced his later official portrayals, where he was written as a rogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> who wiped out entire fleets for the right price.

CURE also maintains executive-backed authority to tap law enforcement, intelligence, and military communications and issue (forged, ostensibly from known superiors) orders to same. The very small administration and enforcement arm is meant both to expedite the one order the President retains authority to give it ("disband, commit suicide and make sure nobody will ever find any trace you existed") and make it possible to quickly but fully brief the President on just what it's been up to so an informed decision about that order can be made.

It is implied (If not outright stated) that Shadwell is paid by Crowley and Azriphale, both of whom think that Witchfinders are on their side  Azriphale because he's a witchfinder, and witches are evil, Crowley because of what witchfinders do to witches once they're found.

Five is not few because Gandalf alone saves two kingdoms, spends the prequel restoring a third and expanding a fourth, and defeat his opposing number, doing more for the war effort than an ICBM would. Furthermore, it's implied in Tolkien's notes that the two "missing" wizards had been working offstage to stir up rebellion in Sauron's lands (i.e., three-quarters of the world) and prevented him from bringing his full forces to bear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Death Eaters appear as a rather... small organization. Depending on how loose your criteria is for what makes a Death Eater (and whether some of the unnamed Death Eaters are all different from one another), there's only about 3 dozen of them (and that's including the members that died after Voldemort's disappearance <em>and</em> those who were freshly recruited <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Voldemort's return</span>. There never seemed to be more than 20 or so Death Eaters active at any one time. It's not even clear how many of those we see are really Death Eaters; in the later books they frequently Imperius other wizards to fight on their side, and it was apparently widespread enough in the first war for several well-known members to falsely claim it. Later books establish that the Death Eaters were essentially Voldemort's elite (with an 'Inner Circle' above them) and the core of his forces, with an army of lesser dark wizards/hangers on, other Imperiused witches and wizards, and dark creatures to call upon.
</li><li> Both incarnations of the Order of the Phoenix are also quite small; the original group only had twenty six members (and are said to have been outnumbered by about twenty to one), and about half of them were killed before the end. The second group is not much bigger, but has the advantage of facing a much smaller enemy (the core force of the Death Eaters appears to be about fifty wizards, with the rest consisting of the coerced, the manipulated and the brainwashed, as well as minor hangers-on, who hadn't been replenished when the second Order was formed).
</li><li> The exact size of the wizarding population is an example of this trope. But as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hogwarts-how-many.html">this essay points out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, assuming the vast majority of British wizard children go to Hogwarts (something outright said in the book), that means Britain's wizarding population between the age of 11 and 18 is below the 300 mark. And since that would be roughly one-tenth of the <em>entire</em> population, maybe one-twentieth if we allow for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">wizards' longer lifespans</a>, the total wizarding population is under 10,000. Details such as the size of the Ministry and the number of Quidditch teams mentioned make such a small figure <em>very</em> surprising, but then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, there are actually 1000 students at Hogwarts, effectively tripling the "300" figure for school-age wizarding children and therefore inflating the wizarding population to between 10,000 and 20,000. It was also mentioned that wizards would have died out if they hadn't started marrying Muggles, indicating the population has always been somewhat small and probably still is. Also note that this is just Great Britain (and maybe Ireland). There are other populations in other countries. <em>Goblet of Fire</em> included students and staff from two other schools. There are Quidditch teams explicitly mentioned from other countries. American witches/wizards are mentioned during the Quidditch <em>world</em> cup. Though the magical world would need to be small compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">muggle</a> population to maintain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> and <em>Day Watch</em> both are pretty small organizations. Although there are still enough of them to have offices in most major cities of the world. (even if with only a dozen or so Others per Watch) Justified. A.) there are only about two hundred Others in Moscow, which has one of the "strongest watches" (Paris and Edinburgh Watches being the larger ones) in the world. One cop for every twenty people is actually an unreasonably high ratio. B.) As of <em>Twilight Watch</em>, the Watches can conscript any and all Others in the event of a crisis. The Night Watch trains all Light Others and Light Others unaffiliated with the Watch are even called 'reservists' a few times.
<ul><li> It's noted in the first novel that, when the Moscow Night Watch moved into a new building, they built three floors' worth of classrooms for newly-initiated Others. Anton notes that someone must have been <em>very</em> optimistic, as there are, usually, about a dozen students at any given time.
</li><li> It's noted in <em>New Watch</em> that the Day Watch actually has a lot more members than the Night Watch, and there are generally about 16 times more Dark Others than Light Others. However, this is balanced out by the fact that a good number of Light Others are of a higher level, while most Dark Others are, basically, grunts. For example, the Moscow Day Watch only has one top-level Other, while its counterpart has three active members of the same level with one more in reserve. Much of the Day Watch is made up of vampires, werewolves, and low-level witches/warlocks.
</li><li> The eponymous organization in <em>Twilight Watch</em> is made up of three Others, although they do employ human mercenaries to do their dirty work.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">other Night Watch</a> is also pretty small: when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a></em> opens, they're down to three, with an option on a fourth if anybody is insane enough to volunteer. This thanks to the fact that the Watch is pretty much a joke position anyway. As the fortunes of the Watch have risen over the series, including merging with the Day Watch under one commander, they currently number around 150 with plans to increase to over 200. Which as Vimes reflects on several occasions, is still extremely small (and amazingly effective) for a city containing a hundred thousand souls (and ten times as many people). (Though much of the actual policing in Ankh-Morpork is done by other groups than the Watch: for instance, the Thieves Guild is <em>extremely</em> thorough about deterring unlicensed thieves.)
<ul><li> By way of comparison, Vimes's refounding of the Watch can be regarded as corresponding to Robert Peel's founding of the London Metropolitan Police Force, which happened in 1829, when Greater London was only slightly larger than Ankh-Morpork currently. At its foundation, Peel's force had slightly over <em>one thousand</em> men.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em> the Morporkian army consisted of possibly fewer than 1000 hastily recruited troops, as compared to Klatch's tens of thousands of veterans. Of course, the Force that actually won was even smaller (but highly trained, and much feared).
</li><li> It's understandable that Lancre, a kingdom a hundred miles across with two hundred inhabitants, would have a very small military and civil service. In fact, however, it consists of just one man: Shawn Ogg, who is also much of the palace staff. Technically there is also a border guard on the bridge into Lancre, but he lived there anyway and is a greeter more than anything.
<ul><li> It's easier to just list the government jobs Shawn Ogg doesn't perform: king, queen, falconer, beekeeper, and (possibly) palace cook.
</li></ul></li><li> Unseen University is like this as well. While we have Archchancellor Riducully and the Bursar, at least half of the jobs are done by one of the brightest and youngest wizards — Ponder Stibbons. And, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em>, he uses his large number of UU positions to his advantage; he's a voting majority on the University council all by himself.
<ul><li> Not to mention that the complete staff roster for the largest, most dangerous, and most topographically-complex Library in the known universe consists of one ape, who spends most of the winter months curled up under his desk wrapped in blankets. Rincewind has occasionally acted as his assistant during times when he is actually around the University.
</li></ul></li><li> The number of Witches in and around Lancre tends to vary (down to about half-a-dozen at one point, but more numerous now), but is apparently not too many, at least compared to times past.
</li><li> By the time Moist is put in charge of it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>, there are only two employees left at the Ankh-Morpork Post Office, Mr. Groat and Stanley. (Three, if you count the cat.) In Mr. Groat's youth, there had been <em>hundreds</em> of mail carriers, office workers, and mail coach crew members on staff.
</li><li> Supplemental materials attest that at least two of Ankh-Morpork's official Guilds comprise just <em>one</em> member: the Guild of Victims (a rather masochistic chap who's paid to get mugged by the Thieves' Guild in his clients' stead) and the Guild of C.M.O.T. Dibblers (founded as a tax dodge under rules which, immediately thereafter, Lord Vetinari revised to prohibit anyone <em>else</em> abusing them).
</li><li> It makes sense that less important gods would have a smaller number of clergy. But there are so many Small Gods around that in Ankh-Morpork there's a single jobbing priestess who is the sole ecclesiastical representation for dozens or minor gods. Including Anoia the goddess of things getting stuck in drawers, whose star is rapidly rising thanks to Moist choosing her as one of the gods to credit with a miracle he arranged (he picked her because he liked the name).
</li></ul></li><li> The Tribulation Force in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> series, despite its grand name, is just four people. Worse, the world-conquering conspiracy they're rebelling against is also... four people (as the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2010/07/06/tf-gang-of-four/">Slacktivist pointed out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). It's actually 6 if you count the two who are in <em>both groups</em>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a>'s multimillion dollar criminal organization consists pretty much entirely of himself and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>. Apparently, Artemis occupies himself primarily with grand theft and fraud, having greatly scaled down the family's usual enterprises in order to ensure that he can personally tend to all of his crimes (although he still makes use of his butler's and family's vast network of contacts). He also heavily invests his criminal earnings.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Oz</a></em> series from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMarvelousLandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMarvelousLandOfOz">The Marvelous Land of Oz</a></em>, it's revealed that the entire Royal Army of Oz is <em>one person</em>, The Man With the Green Whiskers who first appeared in the original book. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OzmaOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OzmaOfOz">Ozma of Oz</a></em>, the Tin Woodman has expanded it to 30 people, 3 of which are only mentioned. Another example in the Oz books was the army formed by Queen Ann Soforth of Oogaboo in <em>Tick-Toc of Oz</em>, which had only 17 members (16 or which were officers) which made sense, seeing as Oogaboo itself had a population of only 50.

However, the Denarians are also backed by a veritable army of human fanatics that are comparative to a small nation, so while the Denarians are few in number, their supporters certainly aren't.

The GE (and later Kabletown) executive hierarchy at NBC sometimes seems to consist entirely of Jack, although this is mostly because he has a large personal interest in Tracy (who is high maintenance and a mainstay of their income) and Liz (who he has an interest in grooming for the elite). There have been several occasions where Kenneth comes to him with a problem, prompting Jack to remind him that there are numerous people in between the two of them.

Both groups are actually very much <em>over-represented</em>, the Gestapo very much so. The large Wehrmacht presence is harder to explain though - in one episode an outing is announced "to be attended by all officers below the rank of General" - and sure enough, that turns out to be just the three regular officers.

Real embassies to major diplomatic postings would also have attaches, security personnel, some career foreign service officials, at least one spy (masquerading as one of the above), and the dependents of all of the above (Londo has some dependents, but they only show up in one episode; Londo and his wives hate each other, which is why they spend most of their time seventy-five lightyears away). They might even bring their own cooks and cleaning staff in order to make it harder for outsiders to spy on them. Either justified or made worse by the fact that they don't seem to have actual embassies, just two sets of personal quarters. In the Centauri's case it's explicitly because the first four Babylon stations were destroyed and they fully expect the fifth to be as well, so they sent someone expendable as an Ambassador and waited almost a full year to even send him one aide.

<ul><li> The Watch in the show starts at about the same level, but takes more casualties over time. The writers also apparently completely forgot about the men in the other two castles after Season 4, making the population of Castle Black the entire Night's Watch.

</li><li> Appears to have taken full effect in Season 7, with Cersei's Queenly court only having a few members, the lords of the Reach being of a number that can be counted on one hand, and no Dornish lords being seen since Season 4. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Made especially apparent when a great meeting is called to discuss a truce and only Daenerys' own small court, Jon Snow, and Cersei's guard show up, despite there being seven kingdoms.</span>

</li><li> The Company in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> sometimes enters this territory. Sometimes they're portrayed as a large group with many teams of two agents (one super, one normal) out taking care of assignments. Other times The Company is portrayed as just Bob, his daughter, and some Indian doctor he has to coerce into being a thug because he apparently doesn't have anyone else to send on missions anymore. In the first season it is portrayed as all powerful yet they only regularly show 1 character and have guest appearances by actors for the more high ranked members. Yet in Season 2, Bob is running round doing the recruiting in Cairo as well as "kidnap missions." This makes one wonder if it is falling into disarray. This is confirmed in Season 3 where the company corridors are empty and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Angela Petrelli</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayorOfAGhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayorOfAGhostTown">alone</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>, <em>good God</em>, yes. The entire NCIS lab consists of <em>one</em> person, the morgue has two, the administration has one, and so on. No other team or lab workers or <em>anyone</em> are ever seen. Deconstructed in that they all work sixteen hour days in order to do the jobs of an entire organization themselves.
<ul><li> There are other teams, some of which are even shown occasionally, but Gibbs' team is supposed to be the best, which explains why it's the one getting sent on most of the murder investigations. The other agents - and sometimes Gibbs' team itself - are presumably taking care of more mundane things like kidnappings.
</li><li> There are other members aside from the NCIS Director in the administration, though the only other member regularly seen is Assistant Director Granger, who permanently oversees the Office of Special Projects on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em>. Vance himself was promoted to his position after spending time as the agency's Deputy Director. Vance also has his own number two, whose absence from headquarters is handwaved by saying that Deputy Director Jerome Craig is almost permanently on the road attending international conferences that Vance doesn't want to bother with and doesn't enjoy being in the office in the first place.
</li><li> Abby is presumably assigned specifically to Gibbs' team; if she works on anything for anyone else we don't see much of it. This isn't very efficient (it would be much better to have one large lab for all teams to avoid duplication of equipment and to allow the more esoteric equipment to be run by a specialist in that particular piece of equipment, as well as allowing the lab to do analysis of multiple pieces of evidence at once instead of having a bottleneck because there's only one tech doing everything), but that would require a larger cast/set.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans">NCIS: New Orleans</a></em> seems to consist of three agents, a medical examiner and a forensic lab tech with no indication that it has any other personnel, to the point of the main characters being called in whenever there is a crime when they are off-duty. The NCIS office in New Orleans is supposed to be the Navy's investigative centre for the entire Gulf Coast! The weirdest part? This was actually the case for the real NCIS NO for some time, which was the inspiration for the show in the first place.

In the pilot Finch has a bunch of bodyguards and a lawyer working for him so it is possible that he employs a large number of people behind the scenes to support his operation but he deliberately keeps all that secret from Reese (and the audience). The largest Team Machine has ever gotten was during Season 3, when they had five full members (Six if you count the dog), two specialists called in on a highly infrequent as-needed basis, and one independent operator who turned up whenever <em>she</em> needed <em>their</em> help.

It's possible that the Ha'taks that Netan gave Teal'c were similarly enhanced. They just weren't enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has a recurring plot point of the USS Enterprise being the only ship in Star Fleet available for even the most important missions. The worst case was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">first movie</a> where it was the only ship available when an unknown object of great size approached Earth. Repeat, Star Fleet only had ONE ship to defend their <em>base of operations.</em> Occasionally this is subverted and we do see large groups of ships appear, but outside of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, in which there was a full scale war going so it would ludicrous to keep using the "we're the only ship available" plot thread, it's extremely rare.
<ul><li> They do the same thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>, where a ship carting VIPs and press around <em>within the solar system</em> is the only ship in range to handle the SOS call. Note a Starfleet ship can traverse the solar system in something like 10 seconds. And again, Earth is the center of the Federation, with <em>San Francisco</em> as its capital. It makes sense to be the only ship in the sector when they run into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> while exploring the vast reaches of space, but you can't be the only ship in the sector when <em>the ships are built at a network of stations in Mars orbit.</em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, when the Borg are approaching Earth, the Federation sends three tiny fighters to counter it. They all get immediately vaporized. Even if that's literally all they have left after Wolf 359, you have to wonder why the Federation would send those poor pilots on a suicide mission. What did they think they'd accomplish? It's such a pointless, obviously futile attempt the only explanation is that they were automated ships probably set to try and ram the cube.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Original Series</a> episode "A Piece of the Action", Krako tries to call (what he thinks is) Kirk's bluff by invoking this trope: "I only saw three guys in that ship. Maybe there ain't no more!"
</li></ul></li><li> Section 31 is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">plausibly deniable</a> black ops wing of The Federation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> (specifically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>). While Section 31 shows up in three episodes, we only really see one guy (and a couple of extras). Justified (maybe) as the organization being secretive enough that they only show up when they want to, and only reveal one operative to any given group to maintain secrecy.
<ul><li> A less extreme example, but considering the sheer size of the Dominion, it does stretch belief a little that the Female Shapeshifter is generally the only founder to be seen doing anything meaningful. This was compounded in the last season after their union with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Cardassians and the Breen</span>, when many scenes took place at the very heart of their military operations, yet the only commanders ever seen to be giving orders were Weyoun, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Damar and that Breen guy</span>.
<ul><li> Possible justifications, in order: Shapeshifter, Clone, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Damar and environment suit</span>.
</li><li> And in the first case, it may be the converse: when the single mass consciousness of the Founders splits off a part of itself to do anything meaningful (and administrative), that part assumes the Female Shapeshifter's form and personality. The species is surprisingly uninterested in variety, after all, and the character look is supposed to come off as "generic humanoid".
</li><li> Other than the ones on infiltration duty, she was the only Founder left in the quadrant after the wormhole was closed and recaptured by Sisko. She had mass-produced ranks of Vorta to do all the work of actually running things.
</li><li> Even at the height of the period when the Federation and its allies were terrified of Founder infiltration, one Founder took amusement in informing Sisko that there were only three operating in the entire Federation, pointing out that the fear of the Founders was doing more than the Founders themselves ever could.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final episode, the Cardassian "resistance" assaulting the Founder's stronghold consists of about three Cardassians &amp; Kira. This was down to sheer attrition; they started off with a significant rebellion, but by the moment of truth only the main characters (and some random guys who had been <em>guarding</em> the place minutes before) were left alive.
</li></ul></li><li> Section 20 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack">Strike Back</a></em> barely seems to go above 20 people at most (counting silent extras), which is unusual when you consider that it's doing the jobs of the SAS, SRR, Special Forces Support Group... basically almost every intelligence and SF-related job available. And more often than not, when they actually got into the field, it's usually just Stonebridge and Scott. Series 4 was slightly better about this, in that Richmond and Martinez would regularly go in the field, along with Locke, but for much of the series it did seem that Section 20 was just 5 people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>:

It is seldom for all three generals to appear at once, and it is not until two-thirds of the way through the show that there are four at once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em> used to be a large UNIT-sized organization until the London branch (Torchwood One) was dissolved, leaving behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a> Cardiff Torchwood Three, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">never-seen</a> single-man Glasgow branch (Torchwood Two). There is also a Torchwood Four. It apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">got lost</a>, but they expect to find it again one day.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfFrost">A Touch of Frost</a></em>, after a man kidnaps a child, he sends a ransom message saying that said child has been taken by "The Task Force". It turns out that this "Task Force" is actually just the guy, but he uses the name to throw off the police.
</li><li> The Vampire Authority in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> has shades of this; they <em>do</em> have a seemingly endless stream of field operatives and commandos but once we get to see inside thier HQ it seems that the entire government of the international vampire community can fit around one rather small conference table and apparently run the whole thing without any admin staff. May be partially justified as most executive duties would fall on the shoulders of their feudal vassals.
</li><li> The team from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em> consists of just four people backed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> tasked with protecting the entire world. This was apparently not always the case as scenes in the '60s reveal a busy office with at least two active teams. However, flashbacks to the 90s always show just two guys (Young Artie and Young MacPherson). An alternate present where Pete was never born <em>also</em> has the Warehouse reduced to a single team with a supervisor. This is especially weird as we are shown that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscientCouncilOfVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscientCouncilOfVagueness">The Regents</a> that is in charge of the Warehouse but never seem to do much number at least a dozen. This was justified the first time we see them in person; other than go to meetings for votes they have almost no involvement and make their living in other jobs. The idea is that they represent the population at large.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988">War of the Worlds (1988)</a></em>, the US government's response to a planetary invasion by aliens who had previously almost devastated the Earth was... to put three scientists and one soldier to work on the problem. The project was later assigned a military squad as well, but <em>still</em>.
</li><li> Major Crimes Unit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>. Justified in that instance because the higher-ups only created it when a judge twisted their arm. So they naturally get the worst office space and cops to fill it out; the unit has to keep fighting for their <em>very existence</em> on account of their habit (led by Lester Freamon and Jimmy McNulty) of following the case where it leads, even if—strike that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">especially if</a>—it bothers people in high places, including the same higher-ups who were so reluctant to create it in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> consists of only two people handling the "special" cases.

It is implied the agency is somewhat larger, and that they are deployed in very small units as specialists, using conventional military as muscle. An expansion shows that the organization actually consists of seven people (Raynes, Chen, and the unnamed Sergeant), but one can take that with a grain of salt seeing as the first game's expansions were third-party and the official sequel, <em>FEAR 2</em>, chose to <em>at best</em> re-interpret some notable setpieces from them.

Some are justified: With yours at least, it's somewhat clear that you're just a branch of the greater Corleone Family. The Manganos are also apparently an offshoot of an established Sicilian Family. The two Rosato Families are unauthorised splinters from the Corleones. The Granados and Almeidas have no onscreen-stated excuse, though.

</li><li> While not an organization, all Keyblade wielders technically form an alliance, since they have a common purpose: to protect and maintain balance within the universe. For most of the series, there are about a dozen Keyblade wielders and even fewer are active during the same time. Mind you, this is actually an improvement (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay">Uniqueness Decay</a>, if you are cynical) from the situation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">the first game</a>, which only features three wielders, one of whom is a villain.

However, the truth is that while the Inquisition is much bigger, the reasons main characters are so rarely seen with other Inquisitors is because A: they are blackmailing the chief to have a large, well-furnished building to themselves, and B: everyone else in the Inquisition hates them and hope that they die, so they rarely send backup. They even have a betting pool. However, the reason they don't just murder them themselves is because they are useful due to their absurd amounts of luck.

<ul><li> The Geheime Staatspolizei/Ge'-Stapo' (State Secret Police) branch of the Schutzstaffel/SS (Protection Service) never had more than a hundred people operating in even the largest cities under Wehrmacht military administration (e.g. Paris, Brussels) or German State Administration (Amsterdam, Warsaw). This included the secretaries and the number was usually much lower. The organisation's effectiveness was entirely dependent upon the local cooperation of its rivals - the Sicherheitsdienst/SD (Security Service) branch of the SS, the Ordnungspolizei/Or'-Po' (Order Police) which were affiliated with the SS, and the local police force of the area in question. In Warsaw the Gestapo was utterly beleaguered due to a rocky relationship with the SD and Or'po', the incredibly begrudging cooperation it got from the Polish police, and general stonewalling by the population at large. In Amsterdam, on the other hand, the German Civil Administration managed to secure direct control over the Dutch Police and the SD and Gestapo forged a working partnership to police a relatively compliant populace and so produced Germany's most effective counter-intelligence work of the entire war. This unusual effectiveness notably caused the failure of the UK's late 1944 <em>Market Garden</em> surpise offensive operation to take the Netherlands.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">The United States federal government</a> has three branches. The executive branch includes literally millions of people, counting the armed forces, and even without them would number well into the tens of thousands. (Homeland Security, OSHA, USDA...) The legislative branch is made up of 535 congresspeople plus staffers (in the year 2000, there were approximately 11,692 personal staff, 2,492 committee staff, 274 leadership staff, 5,034 institutional staff, and 3,500 GAO employees, 747 CRS employees, and 232 CBO employees.), and the judicial branch is made up of 876 judges, their staffers, and a few more independent agencies. The legislative branch is not only small compared to the executive branch, but it's also small per capita compared to representative bodies in other countries. <br/><br/>The House of Representatives actually used to scale with total population; if the original ratio had been maintained to the present, instead of being halted at 435, there would be about 10,000 Congressmen. Compared to that number, the current Congress is a small organization indeed. Even among people who think the size of the Congress should be increased (to make it a bit more representative, and particularly to keep states with larger populations from being shortchanged), the proposals only bump the House up to 500, 550, or at the most 650. There is a reason for this, though; once a legislature gets above a certain size, it becomes unwieldy and can't get stuff done. The largest legislature in the world that meaningfully acts as a primary lawmaking body<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note49jsc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note49jsc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note49jsc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Chinese National People's Congress, with over 2,000 members, doesn't count, as it is a mere rubber stamp, and the British House of Lords, with about 850 members, also doesn't count, as a large number of members never show up and because it is mostly a consultative body, providing an incentive for the Commons to think carefully before acting.</span> is the European Parliament, with 751 members; the next largest are the British House of Commons and German Bundestag, with 650 and 631 members, respectively. Also, the US is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFederalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFederalism">federation</a>, so although the federal Congress can seem unrepresentative, Americans are much better represented by their state legislatures, which have a lot of power. That being said, the Congress <em>does</em> have an alarmingly small <em>staff</em>—in particular, its research and analysis departments, which are supposed to assess bills for their impact, inform legislators about policy, draft bill text, and review bills to make sure they are coherent and have no embarrassing or dangerous errors, are frighteningly understaffed and lacking in resources, meaning that legislators often have to rely on dubious information presented by activists, lobbyists, corporations, and others with incentives to present biased and incomplete analyses.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a> is an example with regard to their case officers. While they are likely the largest single intelligence agency in the world, they have fewer case officers in the entire agency than the FBI has special agents for New York City alone. In this case this is largely because most of the CIA's personnel are analysts as opposed to case officers. The analysts aren't heavily shown in fiction, largely because of the generally boring nature of their work.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Intelligence_and_Research">Bureau of Intelligence and Research<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or INR for short, is the part of the Department of State responsible for organizing intelligence coming from diplomatic cables and helping to define the US diplomatic strategy. They receive and analyse thousands of reports and diplomatic cables from all over the world, have access to classified reports from other agencies such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NSA">NSA</a>, and practically decide what the Department of State and US government's next steps in foreign policy are going to be. They are staffed by...300 people.
</li><li> During Prohibition, the Volstead Act (the act that made the production and transportation of liquor illegal) was enforced by the aptly-named Bureau of Prohibition. Or at least, it was <em>supposed</em> to, on paper. The agency as a whole had only 1,500 agents <em>nationwide</em>, which per 1920 census totals was a ratio of 1 agent per every 70,000 people.
<ul><li> Much of this stemmed from the fact that the Republicans who ran the government when the Volstead Act first went into effect were not believers in big government spending. In a classic case of "it's someone else's problem" mentality, the feds felt that the state and municipal law enforcement agencies would be willing to fill in the gaps in enforcing Prohibition. While that was certainly accomplished in conservative-leaning rural areas, where people were more sympathetic to the idea of temperance, it was a nightmare to enforce Prohibition in the more liberal-leaning cities. City governments felt they shouldn't have to enforce the federal government's regulations. Local law enforcement also tended to see alcohol as a harmless vice. Many cops were drinkers themselves. Though often, the reason they looked the other way was because they were bribed/intimidated into doing so. This in part was how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a> managed to amass so much control over organized crime in Chicago.
</li></ul></li><li> People tend to think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveJacksonGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveJacksonGames">Steve Jackson Games</a> (the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon">Toon</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em>) as a moderately powerful force in the gaming industry. Their total staff is less than twenty people at any one time with most work being contracted with freelancers. Most game companies are <em>even smaller.</em>
</li><li> Some of the most popular websites in the world, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, are staffed by fewer than 100 people.
</li><li> Back during the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicbooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicbooks">Silver Age</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> barely existed and the actual office making the comics consisted of a room with two sections, one being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a>'s office and the other being (mostly) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>'s workspace, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDitko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDitko">Steve Ditko</a> and a few others dropping in from time to time to get their assignments or collect their paychecks. Apart from them, there was Stan Lee's secretary "Fabulous Flo" in a desk out front, who had the unenviable task of keeping any fans who were visiting the company from taking an "unofficial" tour of the office. As she would say in a later interview, "There really was nothing back there to see."
</li><li> Many terrorist/freedom fighter groups can have huge world impacts despite barely having enough members to fill a bus.
<ul><li> The far-left agitators Weather Underground never had more than about 30 members at any time.
</li><li> Al Qaeda never had much more than 3,000 members, and only around forty guys were involved in planning and executing the 9/11 attacks. Today, Al-Qaeda proper consists of 300-500 guys holed up somewhere in the mountains of Pakistan.
</li><li> There are much larger "franchise" AQ groups (Al-Qaeda in <strike>Iraq</strike> Mesopotamia, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb being the ones you're most likely to hear about), but they're independent guys who started using the name, after which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama bin Laden</a> "let" them use it.
</li><li> Despite its notoriety, the Symbionese Liberation Army, best known for kidnapping and allegedly brainwashing Patty Hearst, never had more than sixteen known members at one time.
</li><li> Following a particularly disastrous boat trip from Mexico, Fidel Castro hit the shores of Cuba with around a dozen guerrillas. Throughout the entirety of the Cuban Revolution his band averaged around 200-300 men.
</li></ul></li><li> The controversial Westboro Baptist Church, which has been notorious in recent years for its picketing of funerals and anti-gay propaganda, has only 39 members as of last count, mostly members of the extended family of its founder Fred Phelps. His death and defections by members have shrunk the original group. They have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">no real affiliation</a> with any Baptist denomination, and both the Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention (the two largest Baptist denominations) have denounced them and condemned their actions.
</li><li> Independent videogame developers tend to be rather small. Some examples include:
<ul><li> Mojang AB<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5t18b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5t18b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5t18b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Formerly Mojang Specifications</span>, which is known for developing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6uhfg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6uhfg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6uhfg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which is, itself, currently being developed by 4.5 people</span> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallersBane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallersBane">Caller's Bane</a></em> (formerly <em>Scrolls</em>), currently consists of 40 people<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7r0nn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7r0nn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7r0nn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the majority of which just work on the business end of things, until recently when Microsoft purchased the whole company from Notch for $2.5 billion</span>, but was, initially, run by just 1 person: Markus "Notch" Persson.
</li><li> Carpe Fulgur, the 2-man localization team that brought <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RecettearAnItemShopsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RecettearAnItemShopsTale">Recettear</a></em> out of Japan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Team Shanghai Alice</a>, a one-man operation.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a>, which is still pretty small compared to other game companies, only had seven members when they made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em>, which, coincidentally, had a theme song by "The Power of Seven." Before Marathon, Bungie consisted of two people who worked on games in their basements.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> is an incredibly intricate and detailed game with head-crushing complexity, featuring damage systems detailed down to <em>individual tissue layers</em> and random dwarf generation that is more complex than most roleplaying games' entire player character generators. It's a text game whose sheer depth of processing can crush a computer that can run <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>. This game is programmed by a lone individual, known as Toady One.
</li></ul></li><li> The modern postindustrial service economy has made it completely possible for a few guys to create a multi-billion dollar tech company in their basements.
<ul><li> As noted, Mojang started with just one person and never had more than a few full time workers before it was sold to Microsoft for $2.5 billion.
</li><li> The cross-platform messaging system WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, who eventually brought a handful of friends on to the project. By 2013, over 400 million people were using the service, and in early 2014 it was sold to Facebook for $19 billion.
</li><li> Skype, most famous for creating the video call application of the same name, was founded by Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström, with the Skype software itself originally developed by Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallinn, who together with Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström were also behind the peer-to-peer file sharing software Kazaa. It took less than two years for Skype to be valued in the billions; in 2005 Ebay bought Skype for $2.5 billion in cash and stock plus additional performance-based compensation.
</li><li> The crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, originally started by San Diego residents Brad Damphousse and Andrew Ballester in 2010, sold for $600 million in 2015 after being used by tens of millions of people to raise billions in crowdfunding through its services. It has only grown bigger since then, with $100 million in revenue in 2016 and an estimated value of <a class="urllink" href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/89301-88">$1 billion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as of 2019. It is currently more than twice the size of the world's next-largest crowdfunding site, Kickstarter. All with only <a class="urllink" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2016/10/19/free-market-philanthropy-gofundme-is-changing-the-way-people-give-to-causes-big-and-small/#701a7fef7796">60 staffers at its HQ<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and 165 total employees (most of whom work in the customer-service team in San Diego that returns emails and phone calls).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">The Knights Templar</a> began, supposedly, as a band of just nine knights whose ostensible goal was to protect pilgrims traveling in the Holy Land.
</li><li> Jack Daniel's (the drink) counts as one of these. Despite being one of the most profitable and iconic alcoholic drinks out there, only 365 actually work for and produce the drink at a single distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee. And (famous Scottish distillery) Glenmorangie's tagline "Handcrafted by the Sixteen Men of Tain" is more or less literal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>. At any given time, there are fewer than 1,000 "made men" in the United States. Most cities that are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">New York City</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> will have fewer than 20. Of course, each of them will have a small army of wannabes, thugs, and other followers (the majority of whom are not considered prospects to ever be "made"), plus employees in any legitimate businesses they run.
</li><li> Invoked and subverted by various historic nomad empires. Many nomadic tribes were small in population, but could muster larger armies than sedentary populations because most of their fighting age men could be mobilized to fight. For example, the Mongols during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>'s rule probably had a population of less than a million, but his army, at its height (for the invasion of Khwarezmid Persia), numbered about a quarter of million men or more, which, although not huge, was a quite large force for the Middle Ages. Of course, this also means that, if a nomad army is defeated, the whole tribe can wither away very fast.
</li><li> Britain's equivalent of "Project Blue Book", monitoring UFO sightings and assessing which could be explained and which were an inexplicable residue that baffled analysis, consisted of <em>one</em> civil servant supported by a part-time secretary to do his typing...
</li><li> Uruguay was a focus of conflict between Brazil and Argentina even before they were independent (from the Portuguese and Spanish colonial empires respectively). Brazil annexed it in 1820, while the bulk of the Argentine armies were crossing the Andes to carry the independence war to Chile, and the few remaining forces were in a civil war with Artigas. In 1825, after the independence war had been settled, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Manuel Oribe invaded the now Brazilian province and started an insurrection... leading a group of just 33 people, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Three_Orientals">Thirty-Three Orientals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The following war led to the birth of Uruguay as an independent nation, not being a province of some other county.
