His chains were later removed, but he kept his outfit's coloration for a while. Eventually, the reds in his outfit were changed to purple, with the yellow to blue, to further give him a "blueberry" color. Non-food merchandise has the tendency to use his retro colors still, however.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several characters had different hair colors early on. Takatsuki is the most noticeable, as they had brown for the first two volumes but it changed to black from thereon. Nitori's hair color darkened over time from a light brown to a dark brown, and that's handwaved in-series as her hair darkening as she ages.
</li><li> Makoto originally had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses">Opaque Nerd Glasses</a> but after a few chapters her eyes became shown consistently.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Naruto wore goggles in the first few chapters of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">original manga</a> (including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto1997">pilot</a>) before switching to the ninja headband. The ninja headband was created because Naruto's goggles were too difficult to draw. The goggles are an artifact from the pilot being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a> where Naruto rode a scooter.
</li><li> Gaara is described as a brunet (like his father and brother) in early chapters instead of a redhead.
</li><li> When Obito and Rin first appeared in a photograph in the anime adaptation, their designs weren't 100% concrete, though the basics were there, if younger-looking. Obito had slightly different hair, wore gray goggles, had no orange on his clothes, and had a stick in his mouth. Rin's clothing was completely purple and her hair was a lighter shade of brown. By <em>Kakashi Gaiden</em> their designs were finalized.
</li><li> Naruto frequently had his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">Eyes Always Shut</a> to make him look more fox-like. This was never completely dropped but became rarer as the series progressed.
</li><li> Kiba's jacket was originally red in the manga before adopting the anime's grey.
</li><li> Tenten's pink qipao was initially blue in the manga.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last: Naruto the Movie</a></em>, Boruto is depicted with purple eyes, which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchworkKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchworkKids">inherited</a> from his mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hinata</span>. The manga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> changed it so that he has light blue eyes. The anime followed suit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie">Boruto: Naruto the Movie</a></em>, with a plot point even being his eye color.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> chapter of <em>Naruto</em>, several of the next generation are depicted as academy students. Some of their clothes, such as Himawari's, were never used in the anime (which didn't adapt the chapter until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em>'s anime had Sarada wear a different uniform as a student, one based on her design from the <em>Boruto</em> manga, with her Chapter 700 outfit appearing in flashbacks from when she was a little kid. Others like Inojin and Shikadai also wear different clothing.
</li><li> Hinata has three instances of this: Her Part 1 outfit is her only main outfit not to be mainly purple. Ever since <em>Shippuden</em>, purple has been her main colour. As a result, her cream-coloured hoodie sticks out like a sore thumb when you compare her pre-series flashbacks, her outfits in Part 2, and her outfits in <em>Boruto</em>. Her jacket was also noticeably thicker, which led some to believe she was chubby. The anime gave her a smaller jacket, which the manga adopted afterwords. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> takes place when Boruto is an academy student, however Hinata has long hair. <em>Boruto</em> starts with Boruto becoming a student but Hinata already has a bob haircut.
</li><li> Kurenai's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalEarlyAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalEarlyAppearance">Adaptational Early Appearance</a> in the anime features her looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>. Her actual first appearance fixes her.
</li></ul></li><li> Several characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yui wore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki">Zettai Ryouiki</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">early on in the manga</a> before the author switched her over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperTightsWithASkirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperTightsWithASkirt">Proper Tights with a Skirt</a>.
</li><li> Ritsu's bangs, which spill out from the side of her hair-band, weren't drawn as prominently in first chapters of the manga.
</li><li> Mugi's distinctive eyebrows were drawn noticeably thinner in the earliest manga chapters.
</li></ul></li><li> The first chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> had some differences in character design:
<ul><li> Jonouchi's hairstyle was different, with normal bangs rather than the outrageous pompadour we all know.
</li><li> Anzu wore loose socks with her school uniform, while in later chapters her socks are normal. She was also depicted with brown eyes, which were later changed to blue following her design in the second anime.
</li><li> The Pharaoh wore ankhs on his wrists.
</li><li> Domino City High's girls' uniform was originally bright orange with a green bow before being changed to pale pink with a blue bow.
</li></ul></li><li> Pikachu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PocketMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PocketMonsters">Pocket Monsters</a></em> originally had green eyes. By the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> adaptation, he had the standard Pikachu's black eyes.
</li><li> The main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu">The Electric Tale of Pikachu</a></em> retrieved redesigns in order to make them look more like their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">anime versions</a>. Misty had a redesign at the end of volume 2 when she joined up with the group, to be (slightly) less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">Stripperific</a>, and was given red hair instead of brown. She received another one for the Orange Islands arc.
</li><li> It's hard to tell as the manga is in monotone colors, however early official art from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> shows Crystal with brown hair. Eventually she was changed to have blue hair like her game counterpart. Several years later, the remakes of <em>Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">have a brunette female protagonist</a>, though Kris keeps her blue hair.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Ho-Oh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> at the end of the first episode, <a class="urllink" href="https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Ho-Oh_Debut.png">it was entirely gold<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> instead of having red wings with green tips and a gold crest and tail.
</li><li> When Gary Oak first had his eye color revealed (in episode 31, "Dig Those Diglett!"), it was shown that he has blue eyes. Afterwards, his canon eye color became green.
</li><li> It's possibly due to being traditionally animated instead of computer animated, however in the early episodes Ash had light skin. His skin tone darkened to its current tone by Hoenn. In Unova he was redesigned to have larger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenEyeColour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenEyeColour">brown eyes</a> to fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> of the games. Ash always had brown eyes, but they looked like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes">Black Bead Eyes</a> unless he had a close-up or particularly dramatic moment.
</li><li> Pikachu's design has changed a lot over the episodes, as he was shorter and chubbier in Kanto but grew slimmer by Hoenn. Meowth has also become slightly less cat proportioned and more slim.
</li><li> In May's first appearance, she was about the same height as Misty, being slightly but still noticeably taller than Ash. Afterwards, she's slightly shorter than him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> It had one with the short called "Berserk Prototype". Guts notably had an eyepatch over his missing eye.
</li><li> Femto is noticeably more bulky and muscular in the Guardians of Desire chapter than he is during the Fantasia arc, in which Femto is depicted with Griffith's usual lithe, slender body type.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>: Revy didn't settle on her haircut until later in the series. This is one of few things the anime changed. In it, she has her haircut from the start.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:

After he properly appeared, he was always slouching and had a messy spiked hairstyle.
</li><li> Mello originally had white hair because his character wasn't finalized and he was meant to resemble Near. Later he was given blond hair. Mello originally appeared with white pants instead of black and his midriff covered.

</li><li> Usagi originally wore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask">Domino Mask</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga, much like Minako in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>. She stopped wearing it within a few chapters (It was still seen, but she typically took it off immediately after transforming and it eventually stopped appearing altogether after the Dark Kingdom arc). Adaptations don't even bother to include it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Generally speaking, the earlier designs of <em>JoJo</em> characters were less distinctive, with the first two protagonists not sporting outfits and hairstyles that are as recognizable or iconic as their descendants, and Jonathan and Joseph actually wear different clothes at different points. The likes of Jotaro and Josuke are rarely, if ever, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolUniformsAreTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolUniformsAreTheNewBlack">shown outside of their school uniforms</a> (at least in the installments where they are teenagers).
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>:
<ul><li> Very early on, Jotaro's hat was smaller and not smoothly fused with his hair in its usual iconic appearance - instead, a bit of hair comes out of a hole at the top of his hat. He's also shown wearing a button-up shirt, which was quickly dropped. Over time his hat grows larger and takes a more angular shape, even affecting his hairstyle as well. The anime adaptation for <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> blends both old and new design traits together, but retains the square look for Jotaro's appearance in the later parts.
</li><li> Polnareff's flattop was much lower and he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairAntennae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairAntennae">Hair Antennae</a> on the front of it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Iggy</a> looked a lot uglier in his initial appearance, closer resembling a real dog before later shifting to a more cartoony and anthropomorphized appearance. Despite this, various video games and even the anime adaptation keep the early design before similarly changing Iggy's appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em> look different at the start compared to the end, thanks to Araki's major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> midway through. The anime adaptation largely used the newer designs for a more consistent visual style.
<ul><li> Josuke essentially looked just like Jotaro with a giant pompadour in his debut. By the end of the story, he has a much more distinctive, youthful appearance, with larger eyes, a slimmer build and softer facial features. Josuke was also depicted wearing a pair of white gloves on the first chapter cover of <em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em> and some of the early official art.
</li><li> Okuyasu's hairstyle looked more like a pompadour, but after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> kicked in, it became more of a flattop.
</li><li> Both Kobayashi and Hazamada were taller in their introductory arcs. After their defeats, they were shrunk down to barely taller than Koichi. Their anime designs depict both of them as short from the beginning.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Giorno's forehead was bigger in its debut.
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diavolo</span> first appeared as a silhouette, he had shorter hair and wore a business suit. This is a stark contrast from his final design, where he has long hair and his outfit looks more like something from a death metal band.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Stone Ocean</a></em> has a rather extreme and infamous example with Narciso Anasui who had shorter hair and was a woman (with visible breast) in his first appearance! This is due to a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, as Anasui was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">originally meant to be a woman</a>, but was changed due to the editors being afraid the majority female cast would push away the target demographic.
</li></ul></li><li> The early colour pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em> have several characters with different hair and eye colour than what the creator eventually settled on. Isanami goes from green to pale blue to white hair, Saizo's eyes shift from brown to blue, Rokuro seems to wear purple lipstick and gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">eye-dye job in the anime to purple</a> while they become increasingly blood red in the artwork.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Many characters had different eye or hair colors in the earliest colored illustrations than they would have later on. For instance, Russia and Iceland originally had blue eyes, rather than the purple eyes that they have now.
</li><li> North Italy's trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">wild curl</a> was originally drawn much smaller, in comparison to now, where it's become a very distinctive aspect of his design. This difference was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by the author himself at one point.
</li><li> Latvia was originally drawn as being only <em>slightly</em> shorter than Estonia and Lithuania. In the present, he's become much smaller than both of them, and one of the smallest characters of the series.
</li><li> America <em>lacked</em> his trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">Idiot Hair</a> (representative of Nantucket) early on, and had his hair parted in a different way.
</li><li> In his first appearance in both the manga and anime, Bulgaria was drawn as having his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">Eyes Always Shut</a>. In all of his subsequent appearances, he's had fully open eyes.
</li><li> Prussia now has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorEyes">Technicolor Eyes</a> (red on top and blue on the bottom), rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">solid red eyes</a> that he was given in the earlier series. And in the very earliest colored illustrations, he had <em>blue</em> eyes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first chapter of the manga, Goku's gi and Bulma's hair are blue, while starting in chapter 3, Goku wears his iconic orange gi and Bulma has purple hair. In the anime, Goku wears a blue gi until the 21st Tenkaichi Budōkai arc, which was also featured in the anime's opening until the start of the Demon King Piccolo arc, <em>long</em> past the point where he got the iconic orange outfit... and in the English dub, which never got the second variation of the opening, the blue gi stays in the opening for the <em>entirety</em> of the first series. Bulma's hair remains blue in every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of the series except the tenth anniversary movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallThePathToPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallThePathToPower">Dragon Ball: The Path to Power</a></em>.
</li><li> In Piccolo's first appearance, his turban has tendrils trailing off behind it. These are never seen again for the rest of the 23rd Budōkai arc, or the series in general.
</li><li> Thanks to colored illustrations of the two not existing yet in the manga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> had to create its own colour schemes for Vegeta and Nappa, with Vegeta having garish blue and orange armor as well as bright orange hair. By the time the pair arrive on Earth, their proper colors are used (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZKai">Dragon Ball Z Kai</a></em> changed the animation to use these colors before the pair go to Earth).
</li><li> Similarly to the Saiyans, <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> gave Super Buu white eyes at first, as opposed to the red he had in the manga.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>:</em> The <em>Utena</em> manga began publishing shortly before the anime went into production. When the anime overtook the manga in terms of popularity, the designs in the manga were retroactively changed to match those in the anime:
<ul><li> Utena's original design depicts her as a blonde with either brown or blue eyes. Her uniform at the beginning retained the same basic design as in the anime, but was pink with blue/white trim. Early art also depicts her in a white duelist uniform with red platform boots, and even with braids at one point.
</li><li> Anthy's original design depicted her with black hair. Her rose bride dress was originally white with pink/blue trim - similar to Utena's early uniform.
</li><li> Touga was originally depicted as having black hair, though the long pieces of hair framing his face remained red. This concept was carried over by the anime - though Touga was a full redhead, those long pieces of hair were purposely colored lighter. His old uniform was similarly accented with both red and black - which was later carried for his design in the movie.
</li><li> Juri's original design retained her distinctive hairstyle, but gave her blonde hair and brown eyes, similar to early Utena designs.
</li><li> Miki's original design gave him brown hair, and his uniform was white with green accents, similar to Saionji's uniform design.
</li><li> Akio, similar to Anthy, was originally drawn with black hair. His red button-up, similar to Anthy's rose bride dress, was also originally white with blue accents.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2008 pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice">A Silent Voice</a></em> Shouya has a mullet. In the 2011 version and the manga proper, his hair is cropped shorter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gintoki wore a pair of riding goggles on his head in the first chapter that were never seen again. Par for the course of the series, the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">spoof</a> this fact in the anime. When Gintoki gets called out on it, he justifies it by explaining that the author decided that they were too much of a pain in the ass to draw every time he appeared, which is why they were left out altogether in the first episode.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gintoki:</strong> You should be grateful you even get any screen time in the opening sequences, you worthless goggles!
</div><ul><li> In his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a> appearance, Kamui had black hair like his father instead of red hair like his little sister. This is actually referenced in one of the later "Ask Ginpachi-Sensei" bonus segments, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">with a fan writing in to point out this inconsistency</a>. After informing the asker that they weren't imagining things, Ginpachi-sensei tosses the postcard away with an annoyed expression on his face.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gamaran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gamaran">Gamaran</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kurogane Jinsuke</a> first appeared as a grinning, demonic-looking man with a sharp, pointy nose, tattered dark clothes, spiky black hair and a unique-looking katana. By the time we finally see him he has a more handsome look with long white hair, wears normal clothes under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> and there's nothing implicitly special about his swords.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: During her first two appearances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine">Kaguya (Moron)</a> looked just like regular Kaguya, just with much rounder eyes and a flower growing out of her head. From her third appearance onward, she is instead rendered in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution">to better contrast her with the more normal looking Kaguya (Ice)</a>.
</li><li> Tora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UshioAndTora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UshioAndTora">Ushio and Tora</a></em> used to have a slightly more monstrous face and, most notably, large, rabbit-like ears emerging from his mane of red hair and dangling in front of him. As the series progressed, those ears leaned backwards more and more until they become indistinguishable from the rest of Tora's hair. In the anime series, they use Tora's "earless" design from the start. If you're willing to count an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a> as a character, then the Beast Spear goes from being more spear-like with a narrow and short blade to getting a larger, broader blade.
</li><li> Because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive">Love Live!</a></em> began its life as a multimedia project with a variety of artists and styles, there was quite a bit of variation in the main characters' color palettes, hairstyles, and the designs of their school uniforms. Once the hugely popular anime aired, it became the standard for the character designs and art style moving forward.
</li><li> During the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SenkiZesshouSymphogear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SenkiZesshouSymphogear">Senki Zesshou Symphogear</a></em> Chris has lavender colored hair, but from G onwards she has white hair.
</li><li> In early chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BananaFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BananaFish">Banana Fish</a></em>, Ash's hair was initially <a class="urllink" href="https://s8.mkklcdnv8.com/mangakakalot/r1/read_banana_fish_manga_online/vol01_chapter_1/27.jpg">short and fluffy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. His hairstyle eventually becomes longer and wilder as the manga goes through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, with his anime design sticking closer to his later manga design.
</li><li> In the earliest chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>, Chiyo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">Girlish Pigtails</a> looked like actual hair before they gradually became more like solid shapes as the manga went through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>. Her anime design uses her later manga design from the beginning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: During his first mention in chapter 432, Kaido, was given a <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/a/a8/Kaido_Silhouette.png/">pointy-nosed, sneering shadowy silhouette<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which the anime extrapolated from to create <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/e/e9/Kaido%27s_Silhouette_in_Episode_570.png/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

You'd hardly even know it was the same person!
<ul><li> In the anime, Big Mom originally appeared as a monstrous giantess with a grotesquely oversized head and bloodshot, all-pink eyes, as seen <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/c/c9/Big_Mom_First_Appearance.png/revision/latest?cb=20170430060038">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. When she returned properly, she was given a far more physically proportionate frame (if still overweight), and her eyes became more normally colored.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, and many have small cameos during the opening arcs of the story before the Shaman King tournament begins in earnest. Many of those characters also look different than they do when they are formally introduced later on. A big example would be the siblings Redseb and Seyram, who have a one panel cameo relatively early on seen from behind. Both siblings have black hair instead of the blond hair they have later, and Seyram appears to be older or at least taller than Redseb despite being the younger sibling in their later appearance.

<ul><li> Captain America had a bare neck in his first appearance, and used a triangular shield rather than his more recognizable circular one (which was changed so that he didn't look like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>). This design has been used in subsequent stories to show his beginnings.
</li><li> In <em>Captain America Comics</em> #1, Cap's costume does not have a star on his back, and the red and white stripes on his lower chest extend around his back. From issue #2 onward through his 1950s appearances, he does have a star on his back, but the stripes only appear on the front of his costume. When he returned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> #4, he had both the star and stripes on his back, which became the standard. The stripeless back was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> into being his earliest design (at first paired with the bare-necked mask), and was the version of the costume that was duplicated by William Burnside<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1a9af');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1a9af" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1a9af');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who is a Retcon himself, assuming the identity of Steve Rogers during the 1950s and becoming the "Commie-Smasher" Cap of that era</span>, while the Silver Age version has been used in all subsequent stories set in World War II save for Steve's earliest adventures as Cap.

<ul><li> The Thing had a very lumpy, uneven orange hide for his first few appearances. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a> gradually evolved the character's design over the ensuing issues, until he finally settled on the iconic, rock-like look the character is best known for. This evolution has been acknowledged in-universe, particularly when Sharon Ventura, the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel">Ms. Marvel</a>, became the She-Thing, and had the same lumpy definition at first.
</li><li> The Golden Age Human Torch was originally drawn as a human-shaped blob of flames, before his design was refined so that his physical body was clearly outlined, with largely vertical black lines to define his musculature. When Johnny Storm became the new Human Torch, Kirby initially drew him with an even more vaguely human-shaped blob of flames than the original Torch in his earliest appearances. Kirby soon updated Johnny's appearance to the "classic" Torch desigh, but made Johnny's facial features visible to distinguish him from the earlier Torch.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> didn't have a flowing cape when he first appeared, and <a class="urllink" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6923538-doom%20look.jpg">his green tunic looked more like a jumpsuit worn over his armor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> Uatu the Watcher originally had visible pupils instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes">Monochromatic Eyes</a>.
</li><li> In his very first appearance on the final page of <em>Fantastic Four</em> #48, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Galactus">Galactus</a> wore a bizarre red and green costume with exposed arms and hands, rather than his more familiar purple armor. The purple color scheme was implemented in the very next issue, but the outfit still had exposed hands and bare legs for some reason. He wouldn't get his iconic design until <em>Fantastic Four</em> #74.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> originally wore short, purple gloves without the iconic three blades on the sides. His original concept art design by Bob Kane was even more drastically different. Batman wore a domino mask instead of a cowl, red tights instead of gray ones, no gloves at all and had two stiff bat wings instead of his jagged cape. Luckily Bill Finger convinced Kane to add all the familiar elements that we've all come to know and love over the years.
</li><li> Kid Flash's costume was initially just a smaller copy of the outfit worn by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash">The Flash</a>. His more unique yellow outfit with the exposed hair was only introduced two years later.
</li><li> Fire from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em> first debuted with a very conservative design that showed almost no skin and even included a mask, a far cry from the more sexy and sensual looks she would later be known for. She was also called "Green Fury" and "Green Flame" in her early appearances, and was only renamed Fire after joining the Justice League.
</li><li> In the original <em>Bloodstone</em> mini-series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ElsaBloodstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ElsaBloodstone">Elsa Bloodstone</a> had long blond hair that she sometimes wore in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">pigtails</a>, and her wardrobe consisted of skimpy explorer outfits that seemed inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a>. Her design was completely overhauled by Stuart Immonen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nextwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nextwave">Nextwave</a></em>, with her hair color changed to red and now being worn in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail">Tomboyish Ponytail</a>. She was also given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a>, which would quickly become her signature garment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Mockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Mockingbird">Mockingbird</a>'s first superhero outfit was a black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyCatsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyCatsuit">Spy Catsuit</a> that showed off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">a lot of cleavage</a>. She was also called "Huntress" in this appearance, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Huntress">DC's introduction of a character with the same name</a> necessitated a change from Marvel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>
<ul><li> Famously, Daredevil wore a bright yellow bodysuit with a dark red/black (the coloring seemed to vary at times; it may have been intended to be brown) tunic for the first six issues of his original series.
</li><li> The target logo on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BullseyeMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BullseyeMarvelComics">Bullseye</a>'s mask was far larger and more prominent in his first appearance. Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a> began drawing the series, he made the logo smaller and placed it more directly on Bullseye's forehead.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a> was much skinnier in his first appearance, and wore a sleeveless, bare-legged costume that looked similar to the one worn by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>.
<ul><li> The Titanians originally all had purple skin in their debut, but they were soon changed to have the same skin color as Earth humans, leaving the purple skin to be a unique trait for Thanos.
</li></ul></li><li> When Tiberius Stone was first introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>, he was handsome, athletic, fashionable, and blond. When he joined the cast of <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> during Dan Slott's run, he was redesigned to have darker hair, a scrawny build, and a nerdy fashion sense.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, the original armor was very bulky and gray, and lacked the sleek build and bright colors of the later suits. The classic red-and-gold suit also went through a couple different facemask designs (the "horned" mask and the riveted mask) before settling on its classic design (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">short-lived nose</a> came much later).
<ul><li> Tony's hair color varied for a while too, being alternately black, brown or red before settling on the former. Pepper Potts also looked different originally, being modeled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">Ann B. Davis</a> (who had played a secretary on <em>The Bob Cummings Show</em>), with brown hair in a bun and a freckled face.
</li></ul></li><li> Fin Fang Foom was colored orange in his first appearance, which was odd, since he was green on the cover.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Hulk</a> was <em>gray</em> in his first appearance, and wasn't nearly as large as he would later become. He also had a flat, Frankenstein-like head in these early issues, and sometimes wore very small trunks that resembled a speedo, rather than his trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">torn up pants</a>. How many toes the Hulk had also varied from issue to issue, with Jack Kirby sometimes drawing him with only three or four on each foot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> didn't have his trademark Cloak of Levitation in his first appearance. When he did finally get the cloak, it was actually colored blue instead of red for about the first year of its existence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology">Amatsu-Mikaboshi</a> had a very minimalistic design in his first appearance in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ares">Ares</a>' miniseries, basically just a japanese monk outfit. When he reappeared in the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHercules">Incredible Hercules</a></em> he gained a more elaborate design, complete with golden headdress, more befitting of an evil god. His hair also became brown (it was black before).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> The horns on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Magneto">Magneto</a>'s helmet were much more prominent in his early appearances. Also, his guest appearance in <em>Amazing Adventures</em> #9 depicted him with wavy brown hair, while all future appearances would go with the white hair he previously had in <em>X-Men</em> #62.
</li><li> In his first few appearances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> sported a green outfit with tights that were worn under a tunic with shoulder pads. When the character joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> the following year, his costume was redesigned into a sleeker bodysuit, which he would wear for the next few years. His iconic blue and white costume would not debut until <em>Avengers</em> #75, and would subsequently remain his most notable and recognizable outfit to this day.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a>'s original headdress looked more like a wimple, albeit one with an opening that exposed her hair. Like her brother, she was later given a slight redesign after she joined the Avengers, with the wimple being abandoned in favor of her signature tiara.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BeastMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BeastMarvelComics">Beast</a> originally looked like an ordinary human, albeit one with enlarged hands and feet. He didn't gain his iconic apelike appearance until the <em>Amazing Adventures</em> series in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, and even then, his fur was initially <em>gray</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairColorDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairColorDissonance">then black</a>, before finally being described as blue in the pages of <em>The Avengers</em>.
</li><li> The original Sentinels had a different color scheme, and were much smaller than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mechas</a> most fans are familiar with.
</li><li> After the X-Men ditched their matching uniforms and got individual costumes for the first time in issue #39, Angel started wearing a bizarre yellow suit with a blue mask and red suspenders. The new outfit proved unpopular, and was eventually done away with in <em>X-Men</em> #62, where Angel was given a new blue and white costume with a halo symbol across the chest. This quickly became Angel's best known design, with many of his later costumes being slight variations of it, such as the red version he wore during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>'s <em>Uncanny X-Men</em> run and during his time with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDefenders">The Defenders</a>.
</li><li> Most of the new costumes from issue #39 fall under this trope. The new design for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> was well received and became his default look for many years, but none of the others had quite as much staying power. These included Beast wearing a red and blue bodysuit with a mask similar to the one on the old uniforms, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> donning a miniskirt with a mask and go-go boots. Of note, the green and yellow color scheme would later be used for her Phoenix outfit, and the go-go outfit would go on to reappear several more times throughout the character's history, including the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga">The Dark Phoenix Saga</a></em> and during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanHickman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanHickman">Jonathan Hickman</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JonathanHickmansXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JonathanHickmansXMen">run</a>.
</li><li> Banshee originally had an unattractive, almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">apelike</a> face during the 60s, but was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier">made more conventionally handsome</a> once he officially joined the X-Men during the 70s.
</li><li> The ears on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s mask were originally far smaller when he first showed up in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>, and Logan himself was less hairy. He was also originally taller, appearing to be around 5'5 instead of 5'2.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> was fairly lean in his early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em> appearances, in sharp contrast to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">Large and in Charge</a> design most fans associate with the character.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Rogue">Rogue</a> first debuted in the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, she had a more homely appearance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">was visibly older</a> than her actual age. She was only redesigned to look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier">younger and prettier</a> once she became a member of the X-Men.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> had a cape in his first appearance, which was quickly dropped in later issues. The cape does still show up from time to time, but usually as a ceremonial piece more than anything. When he first joined <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, he also sported a half-mask that exposed his mouth and lower jaw, which was done away with after a few issues.
</li><li> Lockjaw of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInhumans">The Inhumans</a></em> had completely different (and noticeably longer) antennae in his very first appearance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a> originally had black hair, and wore a much more flamboyant costume that included a mask, fishnets and a cape. Natasha would bring the costume back years later just to tease Tony Stark at the end of a mission in Russia in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>.
</li><li> In the pilot to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> Salem was a stereotypical black cat. In the series proper he was orange for several decades until a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> occurred due to the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a>, where he was changed to black again.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Blade">Blade</a> was drawn in a positively <em>groovy</em> green outfit with oversized sunglasses and a funky afro. His badass leather ensemble only began to take shape in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, before being solidified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blade">the 1998 movie</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> was originally clean shaven and sported a simpler, far less detailed costume. His iconic design and goatee were not introduced until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, when he adopted a radically new look in the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>, Guy Gardner and John Stewart originally just wore the same standard GL uniform sported by Hal Jordan. It wasn't until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> that John and Guy were redesigned and given more unique costumes. John's best known costume didn't even originate in the pages of <em>Green Lantern</em>, as it was actually designed for the 2001 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> animated series before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCanon">making its way to the comics</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em>:
<ul><li> Betty didn't begin wearing her signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail">Tomboyish Ponytail</a> until several years after the series began. Her hair was usually worn down and she also wore bangs.
</li><li> Archie originally had buckteeth. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> they were gone.
</li><li> Moose had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardCharacterDesign">overly cartoony design</a> in his early appearances.
</li><li> In his first appearance Kevin had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes">Black Bead Eyes</a> like most characters. Afterwards he was given baby blue eyes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JosieAndThePussycats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JosieAndThePussycats">Josie and the Pussycats</a></em>:

Melody and Josie wore normal clothes for several years before they first put on their famous cat costumes.
</li><li> Josie originally wore her hair in a bouffant instead of a bob.
</li><li> Alexandra didn't have her signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe">Skunk Stripe</a> early on.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deadshot">Deadshot</a> looked completely different when he first appeared, sporting a tuxedo, top hat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask">Domino Mask</a>. Needless to say, fans familiar with his iconic costume (which didn't debut until the late 70s) would find him completely unrecognizable here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> when they first appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohanAndPeewit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohanAndPeewit">Johan and Peewit</a></em> had five fingered hands instead of their traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands">Four-Fingered Hands</a>. Their hats were also a bit pointier.
</li><li> When Lian Harper was introduced she took after her father, Roy Harper (Speedy/Red Arrow/Arsenal). By the time she was a toddler she had been redesigned to take after her mother Cheshire. Her red hair changed to black and she gained more Asian facial features.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> In early issues Sally was pink furred with black hair instead of brown furred with red hair, and in the miniseries she had red fur and blonde hair.
</li><li> Tails' fur started out as brown or burnt red instead of yellow-orange. The white parts of his fur were also yellow.
</li><li> For the mini-series and a dozen issues of the main comic, Sonic had his westernized design from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> instead of his SegaSonic one. He would gain his full head of quills in issue 12, but wouldn't go full SegaSonic until the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> adaptation.

After being retooled as a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> character she changed clothes. Though she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe">dozens of clothes</a>, she mainly wears a grey sweatshirt (with a varying amount of designs) with jeans.
</li><li> Sonic originally was drawn in his westernized design with the mohawk-shaped quills and potbelly. After a few arcs this shifted to his Japanese design.

</li><li> In a plot related change, Dr. Robotnik shifted from his game design to his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> design a few issues in.

When his origin was regiven a few issues later he was shown to be blond. He's been depicted as blond ever since, barring the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> cartoon where he was a redhead, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansEarthOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansEarthOne">Teen Titans: Earth One</a></em> where he was brunet, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCSuperHeroGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCSuperHeroGirls">DC Super Hero Girls</a></em> where he's a brunet. Also, his transformations were drastically different. For his first few appearances in the Doom Patrol he transformed into normal colored animals that had his green ,human face on it, rather than just a green animal.
</li><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> wore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask">Domino Mask</a> early on but it was quickly discarded. Post-Crisis, the mask was mainly used as a way to distinguish between the original Black Canary Dinah Drake and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> daughter Dinah Lance.

These mostly disappeared over time as other artists took over, to the point most people don't know they were ever part of the costume. As well, his first appearance had the large spider on his back be blue. All subsequent appearances would turn it red.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> wore a white lab outfit during his first appearance in <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> #3, followed by a very plain purple outfit when he returned in issue #11. His iconic green jumpsuit didn't debut until issue #53, and even then, it lacked the yellow collar, gloves and boots, which wouldn't be added until issue #88.
</li><li> The Vulture had tail feathers on his costume in his first appearance, which were dropped for his subsequent outings.
</li><li> In his debut appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a> lacked his razor-sharp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FangsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FangsAreEvil">fangs</a> and long, bestial tongue. Instead, Venom donned a prominent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> with regular human teeth and looked less monstrous overall.
</li></ul></li><li> In her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel">Captain Marvel</a></em> #14, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel2014">Kamala Khan</a> looked older and had a different hairstyle. She also had an overall more feminine personal style (complete with lipstick), which would seem at odds with the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">Tomboyish</a> fashion sense Adrian Alphona ended up giving her in her solo series. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GWillowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GWillowWilson">G. Willow Wilson</a>, this is because the <em>Captain Marvel</em> artists were working off of a generic description of the character, and didn't yet know what her finalized design would look like.
</li><li> In the first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, a number of the Autobots were drawn based off the toy designs rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">animation models</a> that humanized many of their appearances. This is most notable with Ratchet and Ironhide (placing their "heads" behind their windshields), and Bumblebee (having a fully-covered face). Megatron was also drawn based on concept art for a prototype of his Micro Change predecessor's toy, which featured a black helmet with a distinctly different design than the final toy's silver helmet. While the helmet design was corrected by issue 3, the coloration remained black for the remainder of the series. The old helmet design also appeared in his <em>Transformers Universe</em> profile picture.
<ul><li> The early UK stories borrowed even more heavily from the toy designs, as well as the box art (resulting in an oddly gold-chested Megatron in some appearances due to the warm lighting on the upper half of his box art).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em>: In the story <em>Lucky Luke contre Joss Jamon</em>, the characters Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Calamity Jane and the Daltons make their first apperance as members of Joss Jamon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>. All of them look nothing like how they would be depicted in later comics, in which they have larger roles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a>'s Gang of Harleys originally all shared her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver">red and black</a> color scheme. Eventually, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">their colors became diversified</a> — while Harley herself keeps her red, Bolly Quinn became orange, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddNameOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddNameOut">Coach</a> became yellow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy">Harvey Quinn</a> became green, Hanuquinn became blue, Carli Quinn became purple, Harley Queens became pink, and Harlem Harley became white.

The remainder of the series had him wear a sailor suit like he did in the original cartoon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIntertidalZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIntertidalZone">The Intertidal Zone</a></em> introduced the prototype to the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarepants">Sponge Bob Squarepants</a></em>, Bob the Sponge.

<ul><li> In early strips, Snoopy walked on all fours and was much more doglike in appearance and personality than he was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift">later strips.</a>
</li><li> Schulz's drawing style changed considerably over the first ten years of the strip. Originally, the characters' heads were ellipsoidal, the faces were smaller compared to the rest of the head, their noses were pointier and their eyes were very far apart, but over time their heads became rounder, their faces became much bigger, their eyes got closer together and their noses became round. In Schulz's mature drawing style, the characters' eyes and noses form almost a single unit.
</li><li> Many of the characters, including Schroeder, Lucy, Linus, Sally and Rerun, start off as babies or very young toddlers before aging to approximately the same age as the other characters. Charlie Brown and several other characters were originally 4-year-olds but were aged up into 8-year-olds.
</li><li> When she entered the strip in 1951, Violet wore her hair in a braid. Her more familiar ponytail came a few years later.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Jon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Jon">Jon</a></em>, Garfield didn't have any tabby stripes aside from a few on his tail. He also had a much uglier face with heavy drooping jowls. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> proper, his design was a more polished take on the <em>Jon</em> design but with stripe. He also looked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift">looked more cat-like</a> and was always depicted on all-fours. He started becoming more streamlined and humanoid by 1980.
</li><li> Jon had a radically different, more realistic look in <em>Jon</em>.
</li><li> Odie, known as "Spot" in <em>Jon</em>, originally looked more like an oversized Chihuahua. By <em>Garfield</em>, he gained his more floppy-eared appearance. Also his ears were originally black, but changed to brown, a decision that Davis implied was done to make him look less like Snoopy.
</li></ul></li><li> Hobbes (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> fame) was drawn in a fairly simplified and cartoonish fashion early on, and looked more like the stuffed toy everyone but Calvin saw him as. As the years went by, he became much more realistically tigrine, and the pads on his hands/forepaws were eliminated, as Watterson came to find them too visually distracting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Jucika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Jucika">Jucika</a></em>'s title character changed a lot even later in its run, but the first hundred or so strips, printed without color in a different magazine than the rest of the series, often had her look a tad more average than her better known "cuter and hotter" design. She had a tall nose-line taking up space on her face, inconsistent head shapes, less prominent hair, at times thick brows and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkintoneSclerae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkintoneSclerae">no sclerae</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes">dot eyes</a>. In fact, her gradual design shifts just about made her face look younger if anything.
</li><li> Andy, the mother of the Fox family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em>, originally had bangs just like her daughter Paige.

Over the course of 4 years, the author decides to slowly begin the steps to making Mirror M transition from a <em>Bomberman</em> OC into a proper original works character, by starting with renaming him from his original name of Marty into the Mirror M namesake he's known as today, with Mirror M meaning that he's only a reflection of his former self. About 4 years later would this only see its ultimate resolution starting with an upload on July 28th, 2018 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.deviantart.com/mf217/art/Mirror-M-Phase-1-Reflection-Code-756726667">as seen here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which <em>every single element of his original design</em> that connected him to <em>Bomberman</em> in the first place was completely and absolutely purged from his overall design.

In his more prominent appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em>, he's a <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/4/49/HP_PRISONER_OF_AZKABAN_DISC1-182.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180620004307">bald hunchback<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Despite being played by the same actor, Professor Flitwick's appearance dramatically changed between the second and third films, from <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/af/Flitwick-film.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150623131222">an older-looking, balding and grey-bearded appearance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/d/d3/Dibujo.png/revision/latest?cb=20100118175116">a much younger one with black hair and mustache<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.harrypotterspage.com/2009/10/11/warwick-davis-on-flitwick-got-his-appearance-changed/">This happened because the producers wanted his actor, Warwick Davis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, even though Flitwick wasn't in the script. So Davis was cast simply as "Choir Master," and later Mike Newell, the director of the fourth movie, liked the look and decided to make the Choir Master Flitwick.
</li><li> In the first movie, <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/3/3d/Voldemort_possession.gif/revision/latest?cb=20140711220352">Voldemort had a large nose and red eyes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. When he was resurrected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/1/1c/Tomdh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150829033655">he more closely resembled his noseless appearance in the books, albeit with blue eyes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Granted, he's in a very different state in the first movie than he is from <em>Goblet of Fire</em> on, so it's plausible that he might look somewhat different.
</li><li> Cornelius Fudge had tanner skin and a grey ponytail in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em> which is very different compared to the rest of his appearances.
</li><li> In a particularly controversial example, Lavender Brown is played by a black actress in the first two films, in an unspeaking but credited part. When she gains a more important role in the sixth movie, she is re-cast with a white actress. (Though this may have been a necessary race lift since the sixth book implies she's Caucasian.)
</li><li> In the original movies Grindelwald had two blue eyes but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts">Fantastic Beasts</a></em> he has heterochromia with one blue and one brown eye.

When he makes his full appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Two Towers</a></em>, his design has been altered to a more human face. His design was further altered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitAnUnexpectedJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitAnUnexpectedJourney">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</a></em> by making his eyes bigger and his skin darker.
<ul><li> <em>An Unexpected Journey</em> also provides a glimpse at Smaug, who is depicted as a traditional European dragon with four legs and wings. When he is seen more extensively in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheDesolationOfSmaug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheDesolationOfSmaug">The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheBattleOfTheFiveArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheBattleOfTheFiveArmies">The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</a></em> he is instead a more modern "wyvern" style of dragon, with his wings doubling as his front legs much like a bat. The blu-ray release of the first film is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasAlteredVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasAlteredVersion">altered</a> to line up with the sequels in this case.

His skin is a much deeper shade of purple, and features piercing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBlueEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBlueEyes">Creepy Blue Eyes</a>. Damion Poitier also portrayed him using prosthetics and make-up, while the later films featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoshBrolin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoshBrolin">Josh Brolin</a> as Thanos used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerkisFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerkisFolk">motion-captured CGI</a>. From there, his cameos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> give him indigo skin and a fairly comics-accurate face. By the time he has a major role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>, they've settled on a design, with lavender skin and facial features that resemble Brolin's.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HowardtheDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HowardtheDuck">Howardthe Duck</a> makes his first of several cameos in the MCU in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>; in that film, his face resembles a real duck's, but with front-facing eyes (still beady and expressionless like a real bird's) and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToothyBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToothyBird">toothy beak</a>. When he appears again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a></em>, he's been redesigned, having a taller head, more expressive eyes, a shorter and toothless beak, and chubby cheeks, giving him a closer resemblance to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowardTheDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowardTheDuck">1986 film counterpart</a>.
</li><li> In an unusual example where the early installment was actually released <em>second</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrieLarson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrieLarson">Brie Larson</a> shot her scenes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers">Captain Marvel</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> before production of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">solo movie</a> began. Larson and the crew of <em>Captain Marvel</em> were still working on the character's look so her costume, hair and make-up all look slightly different in <em>Endgame</em> which came out a month later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: Darth Vader's suit had slight differences in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> compared to his subsequent ones. For instance, the chest and shoulder armor is underneath his tabard instead of on top of it, the lenses on his mask are tinted red instead of black (though this is only noticeable in certain scenes) and his chest panel doesn't light up.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaumschiffGameStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaumschiffGameStar">Raumschiff Game Star</a></em>, the eponymous starship crew's iconic "garbageman" uniforms didn't make an appearance until the second season. Ditto the bad guys' black hooded cloaks.
</li><li> This happened on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza">Bonanza</a></em> as the clothing choices of the Cartwrights got changed to Limited Wardrobe so more Stock Footage could be used.
</li><li> The uniforms in both pilot episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> were different, both from each other, and from those in the regular episodes. The original version cropped up in a couple of instances in the first season, notably in "Charlie X" and "The Menagerie" (though the latter was due to incorporating nearly the entirety of the first pilot, "The Cage", through visual records).
</li><li> For their first appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, the Trill had noticeably more forehead prosthetics and lacked facial spots. After Terry Farrell was cast on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, the producers decided they didn't want her under heavy makeup, and altered the makeup to spots down her forehead.
<ul><li> <em>TNG</em> also had several major changes across seasons 1 and 2, a lot of it coming about during the filming of the pilot as the production staff decided to refine their visions of the cast upon seeing some concepts translate poorly from paper to actor. Most famously, Picard was supposed to have a hairpiece, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a> was naturally bald and the vision for his character was one with blonde hair. One use of the hairpiece proved it was a completely ridiculous-looking implement and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome">Picard looked far more epic as a chrome dome.</a>
</li><li> The one-piece spandex outfits the <em>Enterprise</em> crew wore in the first two seasons were replaced because the actors complained they were uncomfortable and a chiropractor warned that the cast members risked permanent skeletal injury because they were <em>that</em> tight-fitting. The cast switched to a two-piece wool uniform redesign used for the remainder of the series, save "All Good Things...", which reverted back to the spandex outfits for continuity preservation when it featured scenes set in the time period of the pilot episode. The original design also appeared in a few other episodes when continuity called for its use<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2lezt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2lezt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2lezt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Identity Crisis" had Geordi revisiting an away mission from his previous assignment on the <em>Victory</em>, re-creating it on the holodeck with appropriate uniforms, including his younger self wearing red as he did in season 1; "Violations" had Beverly revisiting the memory of Picard showing her the dead body of her husband Jack from about ten years before the first season; and "Second Chances" saw the rescue of a transporter duplicate of Riker, who had been stranded when he was a lieutenant on the <em>Potemkin</em> eight years earlier, or roughly three years before season 1</span>.
</li><li> The first season also attempted to update the female miniskirt uniform of the Original Series by having a short-sleeved unisex "skant" variant of the uniform. (Both the Original Series and season 1 TNG costumes were designed by William Ware Theiss.) None of the main cast ever wore the skant after the pilot, and none of the <em>male</em> main cast ever wore it at all, so it was gradually phased out at the end of season 1 (only appearing again in season 2 via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>).
</li><li> Riker originally went clean-shaven, until concerns were raised that he came off as a flat clone of Kirk by being a dashing young-looking action-oriented guy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">He grew a beard the following season, and his character became more divergent and subdued.</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanFrakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanFrakes">Jonathan Frakes</a> had previously sported a beard in the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthAndSouthUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthAndSouthUS">North and South</a></em> miniseries.)
</li><li> Geordi was going to have a mullet, but the consensus was it looked really goofy and perhaps a little flamboyant paired with his visor (think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> meets [[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a>) , so he got a snazzy flat-top haircut.
</li><li> When Worf took over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">Tasha's</a> duties as security chief, his uniform changed from red to yellow, and the non-standard Klingon sash he wore with his uniform was changed from gold to silver to keep it from blending in with the new color scheme.
</li><li> Leonard McCoy's cameo in the pilot was going to feature him in an active role, a little older than his appearances in the original series, before the setting was changed to feature the new <em>Enterprise</em> crew far into the future since his time and he appeared as a crusty centenarian with his identity left ambiguous to the new crew.
</li><li> Troi wore a severe looking, civillian jumpsuit made of grey denim and had an intricate, complicated updo involving numerous braids and hair jewels to obliquely emphasize her alien qualities as a Half-Betazoid and to emphasize her psychological role as counselor. She also had a European accent that apparently is among one of the burrs of the Betazed homeworld. Starting in Season 2 Troi changed into a much more flattering and gentle looking maroon jumpsuit with a dark collar <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3w53r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3w53r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3w53r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> joined by a lavender coloured variation and a turquise dress in Season 3 to add variety to her wardrobe</span> and let her hair down in a mass of luxurious curls with jeweled hairbands emphasizing her role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">The Empath</a>, and cementing her as the show's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>. The look was revised again in the last couple of seasons and the movies were she changed into the standard uniform, ditched the hair decals and opted for simpler, more natural, free flowing hairdoos that also were lighter in colour. She also lost all touches of the accent, indicating how she had become more human-like rather than alien and fully integrated with the crew, as well as her taking her role as Starfleet Officer more seriously. These changes, along with the huge changes in her makeup (from very pale skin and deep red lips early on to a softer, more nautral palette later on) are big enough that it almost makes early Troi and Troi form the movies look like two completely different characters.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie">Pilot Movie</a> "Encounter at Farpoint", Troi wore the first-season skant and had her hair down in a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">Eighties</a> perm. Many, including Marina Sirtis herself, felt that Troi looked like a "space cheerleader", which led to her first-season "severe" look. The original look returned in "All Good Things..." for the past scenes for continuity purposes. Sirtis also came to prefer the standard duty uniform after Troi was made to wear it by Captain Jellico in the season 6 two-parter "Chain of Command", and her casual outfits were relegated to informal off-duty use for the remainder of the series.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> have Rimmer in a khaki Space Corps uniform and Lister in a stained, shabby version of the same uniform, as opposed to Lister's leathers and Rimmer's shiny outfits in later seasons. The Space Corps uniform itself is changed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retroactively</a> in flashbacks, though the original uniforms appear as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gags</a> in Series XII.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> Throughout the first season there was a noticeable variation in Ernie's sweater. Rather than being strictly red and blue striped, it also had orange, yellow, and pink stripes in it as well.
</li><li> Many Muppets had different designs early on and even throughout the years their designs have evolved. The <a class="urllink" href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Character_Variants">Muppet Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has several pages dedicated to explaining the various designs. For example, Kermit originally wasn't a frog, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonCreature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonCreature">Cartoon Creature</a> until 1969, when <em>Sesame Street</em> first aired. Big Bird originally had fewer feathers on his head, and the character that would become Cookie Monster had teeth prior to appearing on <em>Sesame Street</em>. Rosita was originally a fruit bat but became a generic "monster" later. Zoot's skin kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">switching from blue to green and back</a> until the creators ultimately settled on blue.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>, the titular character did not start wearing his famous deerstalker until the second series. Perhaps the creators thought it would not fit with the character's modernisation, but were forced to backtrack on the decision due to the hat's iconic nature. It's not like the character ever wore it in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">original novels</a>. And it only exists in the show as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, never worn by Sherlock in a serious context — he gets downright cranky when a sheer coincidence associates the hat with him in the eyes of the public.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em>. In the first two color episodes, LeBeau wears a navy blue sweater over his fatigues, rather than his usual red one. He may or may not have also worn it in the black-and-white pilot episode, as it is hard to determine, though it does appear to be a rather dark sweater.

Over time they were able to adjust the make up to look closer to the intended designs. In D'Argo's case this required a pretty massive overhaul to the prosthetics at the beginning of the second season that made his skintone much warmer and darker.

<ul><li> Most wrestlers will have simpler, more generic looks in the early stages of their career (as they have neither the money nor status within the industry to be afforded such elaborate attires) compared to their prime years. Some noteworthy examples:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> made his WWF debut in 1979 as a heel who wore blue trunks, kneepads and boots and colorful robes instead of his tearaway shirts. And he had a full head of hair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a> debuted in 1973 as "The Spider", a gangly masked wrestler (he was still playing minor league baseball at the time and wrestled during the off-seasons, so he needed the slender physique for baseball and wore the mask to hide his identity from his coaches). Even during his more familiar "Macho Man" gimmick, people outside the wrestling fandom might be surprised to see that he wore simple trunks and boots, sequinned ponchos and headbands to the ring in the eighties instead of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">Iconic Outfit</a> template of the cowboy hats, tassel-covered jackets and long pants/bodysuit. (As the 80s were the peak of his career, but his 90s look is more iconic).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase">Ted DiBiase</a> started his career clean shaven and with no millionaire tuxedos.
</li><li> Even though the look lasted ten years, anyone younger than 30 would likely be shocked to see that the long-dark haired, monochromatic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow">Crow</a></em>-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> started his wrestling career as a bleach-blond California surfer dude-type with neon colored outfits, as he had spent the later two-thirds of his career with the <em>Crow</em> look, or some variation thereof.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson">Arn Anderson</a> wore fedoras in his early career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Scott Steiner</a> started off with a long, dark brown mullet and clean shaven, wearing a singlet and sporting a more natural-looking physique, then became "Big Poppa Pump", sporting short-blond hair and beard, going shirtless and bulking up to unnatural levels. Like Sting above, it's not really "early" though as the look lasted for about a decade, but most fans think of the "Big Poppa Pump" look.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> had brunette hair, a mustache, and about sixty or so extra pounds on him in the seventies.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> was a blond in his early days, but is better known as a brunette.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a> is best known for dying her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a> various shades of red, purple and pink, but started off with her natural medium-length dark blond hair.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> wore pretty standard wrestling attire during her independent days and later first few months in WWE. She didn't adopt the colorful look until later.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio">Rey Mysterio</a>'s mask originally had a crown design on it but was changed to a cross when he remasked for his WWE career. Also, he wore tights (of various different designs) prior to his unmasking. After unmasking, he first wore dungarees, and then switched to baggy pants due to a knee injury - and they were redesigned to the familiar ones with logos during a brief spell in the indies prior to his WWE signing. His early name, as is well known, was Rey Misterio Jr, corresponding with his uncle, Rey Misterio Sr, who himself remodelled his attire after Rey Jr. after the latter hit it big.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> once wrestled in traditional tights and boots, rather than the jean-shorts and sneakers he's known for now.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> once had a full head of hair and few tattoos.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Bryan Danielson</a>, during his independent days, was fully clean shaven.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a> began his career with hair about as long as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>'s, not cutting it until around the time they split up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> wore baggy pants at the beginning of his career.

</li><li> Kermit the Frog from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> Looked different when he first appeared on the show, "Sam and Friends".

</li><li> Barbie's first sister Skipper was originally a titan hair coloured preteen. In 1979 the "Super Teen Skipper" doll ended with her changed to a teenage. 1985's "Hot Stuff Skipper" gave her dimples and a longer face, while 1988's "Teen Fun Skipper" made her taller. In 1997, Skipper made her an even older teen and she has stayed that way since. She's almost as tall as Barbie and has a new design. In 2009 she was briefly decreased in size but has since gone back to being in her mid-to-late teens.

</li><li> Some other early <em>Bionicle</em> characters also infamously had their masks mixed up by the <em>Mata Nui Online Game</em> developers, which lead to Hafu and Taipu accidentally switching designs.

Reimu started out wearing a much more plain and basic miko outfit, without the ribbons and her memetic armpits. She also had purple hair. Marisa, famous for her black-white witch dress, started out wearing <em>purple</em>. She also had red hair instead of blonde, although only in her first appearance.
</li><li> <em>Namu Amida Butsu!</em> before being shut down and replaced with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NamuAmidaButsuUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NamuAmidaButsuUtena">Namu Amida Butsu! -UTENA-</a></em> had a noticeably different art style and designs from their current <em>-UTENA-</em> counterparts. Not only that, the reboot game also introduces a human form for Karuraten which didn't exist in the old game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em> is depicted with bone straight hair in his sprites but has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">Anime Hair</a> in his official design. This is likely because the prototypical version of him from <em>Capsule Monsters</em> had this hairstyle, and the sprites didn't change when his design did. His hat also has a large Poké Ball on it, which isn't from his finalized design but also appears in <em>Capsule Monsters</em> concept art.
</li><li> All of Blue's sprites in <em>Red, Blue, and Green</em>, besides the Champion sprite, look almost nothing like his canonical design: he has the wrong clothes and has blockier hair. This design has also never been shown in any official art, even art that shows prerelease designs of other characters. It's possibly either from the <em>Capsule Monsters</em> stage or is an early design that wasn't changed when he gained his finalized design. Blue also changed costumes throughout the <em>R/G/B</em> but this was removed from <em>FR/LG</em>. Instead, his champion jacket reappeared in <em>HG/SS</em>.
</li><li> Many Pokémon looked different in the sprites for the first two generations. For example, Charmander had spikes according to most adaptations (excluding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">anime</a>), the original sprites, and early official art but they were removed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Gold and Silver</a></em>. Pikachu were infamously very chubby looking at first but as early as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">Yellow</a></em> began slimming down and by the third gen were in their current, thinner design. Arbok <a class="urllink" href="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/8/8d/Spr_b_g1_024.png">originally had two jagged black stripes on the back of their hoods<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> which were removed in later games. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Mew</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/3/38/Spr_1g_151.png">looked more like an embryo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in the original Japanese <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> before <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/b/b8/Spr_1b_151.png">being given a more feline appearance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in the Japanese <em>Blue</em> and international <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue</em>. Many pieces of early artwork also depict Pokémon in pre-release designs, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Sugimori1996.png">an overly large Pikachu with a white patch on its stomach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4yqao');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4yqao" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4yqao');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The white patch stayed very late in development, as internal New Years 1996 art depict a near finalized Pikachu with a white stomach, similar to Raichu</span>
</li><li> Several Trainer Classes in Gen I used whips. Ace Trainers and even Gym Leaders, like Sabrina, used them. These whips were phased out in future generations. As a result the Tamer class was only used in Generation I and its remakes, being the only characters in those remakes to still use the whips.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Lenora</a> was originally depicted wearing an apron, however Western fans were upset that she looked like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mammy">mammy</a> stereotype with it on. Ever since then, she's almost never been depicted <em>wearing</em> her apron. She holds it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatOverTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatOverTheShoulder">over her shoulder</a> like a cape. This extended to most adaptations, like the anime editing Lenora's appearances to include the new look (the only time she wore her apron in the anime was in her original Japanese appearance).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/XDGRPDH.png">Mewtwo's original design<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> was farly stocky, with a grey-white coloring and a giant head. The Gen I remakes gave it new art with a smaller head, a more humanoid shape, and a deep purple color, but the in-game sprites still reflected the original design until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em>.
</li><li> When Professor Burnet first appeared she had a lighter skin tone. It's unspecified if this is a retcon or if living in Alola has given her a sun-tan.

<ul><li> Mario had a blue shirt and red overalls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em>, <em>Donkey Kong Jr.</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WreckingCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WreckingCrew">Wrecking Crew</a></em>. His colors were swapped around in the arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros">Mario Bros.</a></em>, resulting in a blue cap and overalls and a red shirt; the NES version would change the cap back to red but keep the blue overalls, marking the first in-game appearance of his iconic clothing color arrangement. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>'s artwork for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">The Lost Levels</a></em> (the Japanese SMB2), and the game the rest of the world knows as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>, all kept Mario in his original <em>Donkey Kong</em> colors, though the in-game sprites would differ (<em>SMB1</em> and <em>The Lost Levels</em> had red overalls and a brown shirt, while <em>SMB2</em> had blue overalls and a red shirt and cap like NES <em>Mario Bros.</em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> was the first game where Miyamoto's artwork consistently had him in blue overalls (the in-game sprites on the NES version had the blue portions rendered in black in most levels, though the larger sprites for the Toad minigames, as well as the Mario Bros.-style battle game, had him in blue overalls). The blue shirt and red overalls would eventually return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> as an alternate outfit. Also, promotional artwork for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> depicted Mario as a <a class="urllink" href="http://pm1.narvii.com/6420/4ebcabf8c8495d4c1f2c41aae5d8888fdaf44585_hq.jpg">middle-aged balding man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (which is also how he looked in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros">1993 live-action film</a>), but Nintendo has since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> Mario into a twenty-something and shown him to possess a full head of hair underneath his plumber's cap. Mario's limbs were also <a class="urllink" href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/51c83c7dbd855a19cb8e22002a3a941d/tumblr_ob3mdz2S4V1tu022ro2_640.png">much stubbier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in early artwork, making him appear rather stocky, however modern art gives him <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/2/21/FortuneStMario.png">longer limbs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> which gives the impression that he's actually lost weight in the intervening decades.
</li><li> Likewise, Luigi had a green shirt and white overalls (resembling his modern Fire Flower form) in the original NES <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> Some re-releases gave him a brown shirt-green overall combo to better sync with Mario's colors (or, in the case of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioAllStars">Super Mario All-Stars</a></em> version, the blue shirt-green overalls), and made the old green shirt-white overalls look his Fire Flower form instead.
</li><li> In <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, Toad wore a red vest. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> changed it to dark blue in-game, while in the artworks it was more purple. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> brought back the red vest, but the blue/purple one came back for a decade. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> then introduced, along with various Toads with differently colored vests and mushroom spots, a yellow trim around the vest, which was kept since then.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand">Daisy</a> wore a pink crown in her older appearances, but somewhere around <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></em> it was replaced with a golden one like Peach's crown. Her hair was also long like Peach until it was cropped shorter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a> 4</em>. Daisy was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> era but returned to her original tone for <em>Mario Party 4</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first drew Bowser in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/File:SuperMarioBrosArtwork2.jpg">artwork used on the Japanese box<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> where he has blue/grey skin and black eyebrows. His sprite in the original game is green but lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead">red hair</a>.
</li><li> Starting from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf">Mario Golf</a>: Toadstool Tour</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Birdo</a> wears a ring with a giant diamond on her right middle finger.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand2SixGoldenCoins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand2SixGoldenCoins">Wario</a> originally wore a long-sleeved shirt, but since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandII">Wario Land II</a></em> he's often been seen wearing a short-sleeved one. He's consistently portrayed with short sleeves in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wario">Wario's own games</a>, but alternated between them and the long sleeves in the <em>Mario</em> spin-offs before permanently settling on the short ones.
</li><li> Pauline was originally depicted as a blonde in illustrations for the arcade and Famicom versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em>, but became a brunette in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94">Donkey Kong '94</a></em>, presumably to distinguish her from Peach (who at that point had already appeared in more games than Pauline and was a more recognizable character as a result). Her sprite always had her as a brunette anyway.
</li><li> With the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf">Mario Golf</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis">Mario Tennis</a></em>, Peach and Daisy both wore shorter versions of their main dresses (though the dresses date back to <em>NES Open Tournament Golf</em>). Starting with <em>Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour</em> both princesses instead began wearing sports-geared outfits. Peach also began putting her hair in a ponytail for sports games. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Rosalina</a> didn't get her own sporty dress until <em>Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash</em>. Before that she wore her normal dress in all games besides her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> appearances.
</li><li> Yoshi was <a class="urllink" href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/44Y33.jpg">less-anthropomorphized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> compared to how he would look later on. Certain spin-offs, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">Super Smash Bros. 64</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em>, also stayed closer to Yoshi's original depiction.
</li><li> The Swoop(er) enemy from <em>Super Mario World</em> was green in its initial game but blue in subsequent games. According to the games files, in development for <em>World</em> it was blue but they changed it to green later on.
</li><li> The Ninji enemies introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> were originally <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/a/af/SMB2Ninji.png">black star-shaped creatures with red fanged mouths<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, Ninjis were reinterpreted as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/e/ea/Ninji_SMR.png">chubby little white characters in ninja outfits (with their red mouths morphing into two big red buttons)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, a design that has been used for the species in all future appearances. The one exception has been their sprites in the <em>All-Stars</em> and <em>Advance</em> remakes of <em>2</em>, which used <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/images/b/b1/GiantNinji.png">revamped versions of their original designs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> despite official artwork at the time still using their current designs.
</li><li> Princess Peach's dress was first white with a red trim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, but later appearances would have her in the classic pink dress. The white dress was used as her Fire Flower costume in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em> and it was also used (along with her sprite) as her power up form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>. She was also depicted with red hair in the NES games due to graphical limitations. <em>Super Mario World</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyBlonde">made her a blonde</a> and she's since stayed that way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em>: The character designs in this game served the basis of subsequent 3D <em>Mario</em> games (unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em>, which featured completely different character designs). Even then, certain details were different here — Luigi's pant legs are rolled up (a trait that carried over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>), Toad's vest lacks the yellow trim, and the Boos' middle two fangs are missing. All of these have been updated with the more familiar elements in the 3DS remake.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDisplacement">oft-forgotten</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterI">Street Fighter I</a></em>, Ryu has reddish hair and wears a pair of red shoes. In the games chronologically after it, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes">Does Not Like Shoes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">has pointed it out numerous times</a>.
</li><li> In the same game, Birdie is a fair-skinned, light-toned man. In his next appearance (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em>), he's black and slightly bulkier. He explains: "I was pale because I was sick!"
</li><li> M. Bison / Dictator was fairly slim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em>, but was redesigned to sport a massive, muscular physique in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em>. Most subsequent games have kept the bulk from the latter design, with only a few non-canon crossovers like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom">SNK vs. Capcom</a></em> utilizing his original look. Canonically, Dictator's <em>Street Fighter 2</em> appearance is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyBackupDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyBackupDrive">cloned body</a> that he transferred his consciousness to after his original, larger body was destroyed at the end of <em>Street Fighter Alpha 3</em>. Also, he had distinctly Asian facial features (seemingly owing to his stage being in Thailand) and red eyes with visible irises in the early versions of <em>Street Fighter II</em>, while all subsequent games starting with <em>Super Street Fighter II</em> have depicted him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">racially ambiguous</a> and given him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes">Monochromatic Eyes</a>.

<ul><li> Though Koume and Kotake may be an exception due to just how truly and utterly ancient they are; if their comedic act after their defeat in Ocarina of Time can be believed they're both 400 years old, making them the second physically oldest "humans" in the history of the franchise next to the first Impa - who lived to be over 1,000. No other "human" character in the games come close to these ages, and both examples are almost assuredly due to magic or divine power, so how much the Twin-Witche's designs can be taken as indicative of their race is up to debate.

Melee</a></em>. This created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">popular fan theory</a> that <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.is/GsJ3y">the characters legs were replaced with prosthetics to handle extreme G-forces without passing out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which <a class="urllink" href="https://www.douglasbaderfoundation.com/dbf/who-we-are/sir-douglas-bader">just happens to make sense<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Miyamoto himself confirmed</a> that the prosthetics were originally a gaffe thought up by the developers as a way to justify the design choice to give them all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanlikeFootAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanlikeFootAnatomy">human-like legs</a>. Future games clearly depict the team wearing <em>suspiciously</em> large boots instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> The early games, prior to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, did not have the involvement of the later series art director Yoji Shinkawa, resulting in an inconsistent art style between them. The protagonist Solid Snake was depicted as a youthful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBiehn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBiehn">Michael Biehn</a>-type hero on the cover artwork of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear</a></em>, only to look more middle aged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em> (modelled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a>), despite the two games being set and released only three years apart.

</li><li> In the MSX2 version of <em>Metal Gear 2</em> in particular, Gray Fox and Master Miller do not even resemble their incarnations from later <em>MGS</em> games, with Fox originally being drawn as a tanned brown-haired man, as opposed to the pale white-haired man seen in later games, while Miller was originally a black-haired Asian-looking man instead of the sunglasses-wearing blond-haired man seen in the later games (consequently, his origin story was also changed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Peace Walker</a></em>).
</li><li> Snake had shortish hair in his first three appearances - in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, he appears with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair">a mullet</a>, which initially was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork">Escape from New York</a></em> joke but got made into a character trademark. He also lacks the flowing bandanna until <em>MGS2</em>, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI">PS1 tech limitations made it impossible</a>. In his first two appearances, he is depicted wearing realistic military gear; in his third, he's put into a more fantastical "Sneaking Suit". On top of this, certain aspects of his physical appearance were altered between his appearances in <em>1</em>, <em>2</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">4</a></em> even beyond what his accelerated ageing would account for - in <em>MGS2</em> his features get broader and manlier, and in <em>MGS4</em> he suddenly gains rather prominent nasolabial folds which weren't there in his earlier appearances, and his hair texture goes from wavy to straight. Snake is even depicted with blond hair in the Briefing segment of <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, and Campbell claims the only difference between him and Liquid is "skin tone", forcing Snake to change his appearance (mostly by cutting his hair short); a plot point in <em>2</em> was going to have Snake return to blond, in an idea that got as far as playtesting, but was scrapped for making the character look too unlike his earlier look, and the idea of him being blond was quietly retconned (the blond hair itself also a retcon, since Snake had been depicted with dark hair in the two previous games).
</li><li> Eye colour has generally been inconsistent. Snake's eyes go from dark green to pale blue. Otacon goes from having grey hair and blue eyes, to brown hair and brown eyes, to dark brown hair and dark blue eyes.

<ul><li> In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore">American Kirby Is Hardcore</a>, in early western media Sonic was portrayed with fauxhawk-like quills. The game sprites weren't edited but official art and adaptations used that design. Eventually it was phased out in place of the cuter canon design.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8dr6e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8dr6e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8dr6e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yuji Naka and Team Sonic arrived at Sonic's final design by working with the Sega of America team to come up with a design that would appeal to both markets and thought it was a seemingly perfect compromise. Naka wasn't happy to find out the American team changed it after saying they were satisfied with it (they wanted it to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">more '90s attitude</a>), and demanded it be changed back.</span> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic CD</a></em> also depicted Sonic with an angular design not used anywhere else, except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">retraux</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>.
</li><li> Dr. Robotnik's design was extremely inconsistent in western art during the series early years. Originally redesigned his Japanese design as Dr. Eggman with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore">demonic pitch-black eyes</a> (rather than sunglasses) and a differently shaped moustache, the western-developed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogSpinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogSpinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em> used a design that looked like a cross between his Japanese and western designs.. Shortly after, his design from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> was adopted by the games' western art. Like Sonic, these design changes weren't reflected in his sprites, outside of western-produced games like the aforementioned <em>Spinball</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoctorRobotniksMeanBeanMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoctorRobotniksMeanBeanMachine">Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine</a></em>. After 1995 or so, his Japanese design was adopted by the games worldwide, being used even in Western art and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DFlickiesIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DFlickiesIsland">Western</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR">games</a>.
</li><li> Super Sonic himself has shifted between having completely upturned quills similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Super Saiyan transformation it was based on</a> and having only partially upturned quills in a star pattern, similar to Shadow's hairstyle. For a long while it would shift back and forth depending on the game, but they've finally settled upon the original completely upturned style.
</li><li> In Knuckles first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em>, his fur is a pinkish color, he would be red in all future games.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> Super Shadow's main fur color was a silvery white. Afterwards it shifted between being as gold as Super Sonic and varying lighter shades gold before settling into a lemon cream color.
</li><li> Amy Rose before ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a>' is notably different; wearing a completely different dress and her quills were designed ver differently.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">original game</a>, the Varia Suit (or just "Varia" as it was then known) tinted Samus's armor a slightly dull shade of pink, making no other physical appearance changes. The iconic shoulder pieces weren't introduced until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a>'s black and white palette made a more physical distinction necessary. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em> splits the difference by making the Varia Suit just an orange-tinted version of her regular Power Suit, but adds the shoulder components when she unlocks the Fully Powered Suit late in the game.
</li><li> Early versions of the Power Suit's artwork included hoses or wires on the outside connected between the arm cannon and the upper arm. Sometimes they would also be on the other arm as well, connecting the forearm to the bicep. Some even show the Power Suit without the arm cannon attached, with a green gauntlet underneath. All of these features would be dropped, with the arm cannon not being removable except by removing the whole suit and the wires just being absent entirely. The red chest plate also was bigger, covering the whole chest down to about the navel instead of just to the bust line. The modern design, which has changed little since, was introduced in the artwork for the second game.
</li><li> Kraid was originally a yellow creature with two eyes, green hair across his back, two belly spikes, and spikes coming from his back. Most glaringly of all, he was the same size as Samus! <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> beefed up Kraid's size while changing his hair to reptilian scales, as well as adding a third belly spike and altering the back spikes to claws from his arms.
</li><li> Ridley's appearance in the original game's artwork was... <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/3/38/M1_Ridley.png/revision/latest?cb=20180814232611">very different to what he is now<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, looking more like a blue mutant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Birdo</a>. This wasn't the case in the Japanese version, where he looked more like his traditional appearance. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> made Ridley's proportions more reptilian, but the art colored him red as opposed to his in-game sprite's purple.
<ul><li> Kraid and Ridley's altered designs may have been the manual artists misinterpreting the sprites, as was common at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> Mother Brain's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">Metroid 1</a></em> sprite had a pair of small eyes (best seen in the manual) and tusks, her face overall resembling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastWithAHumanFAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastWithAHumanFAce">human's</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> changed this to a single large eye while adding in a mouth, the latter of which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em> (which has become the <em>de facto</em> pre-<em>Super</em> design) omitted.
</li><li> The Metroids themselves originally had tentacles coming from their underside in both the Japanese and American user manual artwork, but were different depending on region; the Japanese version still had the jaws but a thick cluster of tentacles taking up all of the space under its mantel. The American version instead had just six thin tendrils and no fangs at all, but also had a mostly opaque mantel with a clear front.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>: Jim Fitzgerald in <em>The Lost and the Damned</em> looks radically different from what he appears in the base game: originally a fat, bald, Caucasian generic biker, he is made mixed-race with a distinctive uniform and appearance in the expansion pack. You'd be forgiven for thinking that they were not even supposed to be the same character, since they don't share the same voice or even personality.
</li><li> Alucard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> is easily recognized by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/e/e7/Alucard.png/revision/latest?cb=20140711061545">appearance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which first appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>, but his first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a></em> gives him <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/9/98/CV3_J_Manual_Alucard.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20191031211710">a stock<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/8/80/Cv3_alucard.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20191031225541">design of vampires<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>:
<ul><li> Liu Kang did not have his trademark headband or wristbands in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1">the first game</a>. Johnny Cage also wore a pair of trunks, likely as a nod to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanClaudeVanDamme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanClaudeVanDamme">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>'s character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bloodsport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bloodsport">Bloodsport</a></em>.
</li><li> Shang Tsung was an old man with gray hair and a long beard in the first game. Most subsequent games instead depict him as much younger, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> explaining that Shao Kahn had restored his youth.
</li><li> Kano looks far different in the first three games than he does in the later installments. Rather than being a bearded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeAussie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeAussie">Awesome Aussie</a> with a full head of hair, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil">bald</a>, clean shaven, and wore martial arts gear. His more recognizable design came about due to the popularity of Trevor Goddard's portrayal of the character from the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> movie, which introduced several of Kano's most iconic traits, such as the beard and Australian accent.

<ul><li> Kitana is now portrayed with distinctly Asian facial features, whereas in previous games her appearance was always more vague. She was portrayed by Latinas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat">both</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation">films</a>, and by a white brunette in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3">Mortal Kombat 3</a></em> era, and her later appearances were always based on these cues. Most likely, the designers felt making her look Asian was only appropriate given that she comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> of East Asia.
</li><li> In addition to giving Jacqui Briggs a more distinct play style from her father Jax, her appearance was greatly reworked as well between her debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX">Mortal Kombat X</a></em> and this game. In <em>MKX</em>, she had caramel skin, a button nose, and microbraids. In <em>11</em>, she was given darker skin, larger facial features, and dreadlocks (at least in her default costume).
</li><li> A non-visual example would be Noob Saibot's voice. In older games, he spoke normally. Here, he talks in a deep whisper that players have compared to Dr. Claw from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>.

<ul><li> On a related note, Winbee and Gwinbee were originally generic Twinbee recolors. <em>Detana!!</em> gave them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution">new, distinct designs</a>.
</li><li> Also, no one could decide what color Winbee should have been. Official artwork for <em>Twinbee</em> and <em>Moreo! Twinbee</em> gave her a red color, but the in-game sprites made her pink. Even worse, <em>Twinbee 3</em> made her red in-game! Fortunately, <em>Detana!!</em> set things straight by making pink her permanent color.

<ul><li> While Taiga Saejima's default appearance (the one first seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza5">Yakuza 5</a></em>) nowadays has him with a shaven head and a thick parka jacket, his debut playable appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza4">Yakuza 4</a></em> showed him with a full head of long black hair and an ordinary coat, making him appear far smaller. Some parts of his story including his prologue show him in his <em>Yakuza 4</em> design and being a prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza0">Yakuza 0</a></em> shows him with his long hair from <em>4</em> in his character bio, but otherwise the shaven head and parka are now standard for him.
</li><li> Prior to becoming Tojo Clan chairman, Daigo's default outfit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza2">Yakuza 2</a></em> was a padded white jacket and black pants, and slightly messier. From all other games he'd be seen in prim black business suits and a neater hairdo more suited to his newly gained position as chairman of a criminal organization.
</li><li> In a case of this being retroactively applied to a later installment via the prequel, Kiryu and Majima don't wear their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">famous attires</a> from other games in the series, only getting their iconic designs in the epilogue of the game. Kiryu instead wears a brighter white suit with an orange, chain-patterned undershirt, and Majima, running a cabaret club at the time, wears an open-coat tuxedo with an undone bowtie (unless he's on the clock, wherein the bowtie is obviously done up properly and the coat is closed.)

The remakes, anime, manga, and Steam release all change it to exclude the blazer and change the tie to a blue bowtie. The original uniform is instead her old boarding school uniform.

<ul><li> In a 2001 <em>Ramyun Boy</em> (a South Korean flash animation series for children that was popular in the early 2000s) episode, the titular main character and his love interest look different from their final appearances. Examples are Ramyun Boy looking chubbier and Ramyun Girl having visible hair.

He lacks his fingerless gloves as well as the armor he wears on his arms. His hair is also significantly different, being purple instead of gray and styled differently in the front.
</li><li> Outside of battles, Nora originally wore a bow behind her skirt. This was scrapped after Volume 1 because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI">the bow was hard to animate</a>.
</li><li> Blake's cat ears were purple when she first revealed them in volume 1 but they later turned as black as her hair.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>AstroLOLogy</em>: All of the characters were changed in appearance between the 2016 Flash shorts and the 2018 CG shorts, some more greatly than others. Of note, every character initially had their sign somewhere on their person and most of them had eyes with colored irises before they switched to simple black eyes in the final product.
<ul><li> Aquarius/Albert had dark yellow eyes and braces and his sign was on his headband.
</li><li> Pisces/Priscilla had pink eyes, a cyan mermaid tail, the fish tail shape in her hair leaned forward instead of being in the back pointing upward, and her sign was on her earrings. She would be given legs and a cyan dress, as well as a larger mouth.
</li><li> Aries/Aaron had light blue eyes, his hood appeared to be a bodysuit that covered all but his face and had slightly different horns, he had a sleeveless dark green shirt with his sign in a yellow circle at the top and a yellow stripe at the bottom, and his pants were yellow. The bodysuit was removed and the hood left intact, his shirt was changed to a long-sleeved light green shirt, and his pants were changed to red.
</li><li> Taurus/Tiny had a large, round <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagNose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagNose">Gag Nose</a> with a bull-like septum ring, his tie was yellow instead of orange with his sign on a pin in at least one design, and he had hooves instead of normal feet.
</li><li> Gemini/Gerry and Gary had their signs on their hats, one had a green eye while the other had yellow eyes. They were both ovular in appearance, but one was changed to be cylindrical later.
</li><li> Cancer/Candy had turquoise eyes, her dress had a red body and a white bottom with a pink stripe, she wore red shoes, and her sign was on both of her hairbands. The dress was changed to pink with a darker pink stripe and she was given dark purple stockings.
</li><li> Leo/Leonardo's hair was more like a lion's mane, he wore a belt with his sign on the buckle, he wore shorts and no shoes, and he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlUnibrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlUnibrow">Big Ol' Unibrow</a>.
</li><li> Virgo/Victoria had green eyes, her dress was green with her sign at the top and a white stripe at the bottom and covered her legs, and she had brown shoes. She would later wear a shorter white dress with a blue collar and red stockings.
</li><li> Libra/Larry had red eyes and his sign was on his crest, but he was otherwise the same.
</li><li> Scorpio/Scotty had grey eyes and an eyebrow ring and wore a belt with his sign similar to Leo's. His legs were also much shorter.
</li><li> Sagittarius/Sally had orange eyes, one of them obscured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs">Peek-a-Bangs</a>, a red jumper with a green and yellow sash, and brown hooves, and her sign was on her hairband. She would be given a green tank top and more humanoid legs with brown pants and light brown shoes that give the impression of hooves, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs">Peek-a-Bangs</a> were removed, and her hairband now had an arrow going through it.
</li><li> Capricorn/Casey had dark green eyes, a dark green mermaid tail, a belt with his sign, and his ears were brown in one design. He would be given legs and would wear lime green pants with brown suspenders and a white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a>.

Cio went from a bug-eyed, insect-like humanoid to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> as her desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHatePastMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHatePastMe">leave her past behind</a> (in which she was an insectoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>) became apparent.

It seems like you changed how you were drawn, in this level." Although his basic features remain mostly unchanged, his face appear rounder, his build seem less muscular, and his hair shorter and spikier, thus giving him a more youthful and cartoon-like appearance.

The comic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltText">Alt Text</a> has this to say:
<div class="indent"><em>I'm sure this character won't look super different next time she shows up</em>

<ul><li> Certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a> characters have evolved greatly over time, even beyond the extent of the site-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>. For instance, Bruce was originally a photograph of British television host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceForsyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceForsyth">Bruce Forsyth</a>, and then a caricature of the same, before becoming a penguin-like creature; Kau was originally a caricature of American R&amp;B singer Macy Gray (and was named "Macy Gray" to boot); and Mynci started out as a redheaded human named Mellish.
</li><li> In the 2001 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">Mata Nui Online Game</a></em>, the Matoran look like their toy prototypes instead of the final designs (having flat and thin arms, no "rim" on their heels and a different head), and the appearance of the <a class="urllink" href="https://biosector01.com/w/images/bs01/2/21/Pakari_Onua.png">Pakari<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> and <a class="urllink" href="https://biosector01.com/w/images/bs01/c/ca/RuruNoble.png">Ruru<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> masks are almost always wrong. These were due to the rushed development and to the game sprites being based on bad photographs and primitive 3D assets from other games. Some confusion also stemmed from the Tarakava beast, which had a Pakari mask on its snout but the prototype had a Ruru. The game artists created various combinations of the two masks before getting them right and multiple characters who wore a Pakari were drawn with a Ruru and vice versa. The 2002 web animations redid most masks to be accurate to the toys but certain characters still had the wrong types and the Matoran still retained their prototype bodies. In the 2003 sequel game, the bodies were redesigned and the masks were finally fixed.

The latter was constantly in flux for the first few seasons, before they eventually settled on him being black.
</li><li> Nelson's parents both had different designs at first. His father was designed as a soccer coach whose character model has been used frequently in crowd shots, only to be later redesigned to resemble a much older Nelson. Oddly, recent episodes have used the older design. Mrs Muntz originally resembled an older Nelson in drag and was later changed to the design she has today.
</li><li> Chief Wiggum, Moe, and Milhouse all had black hair in the first season, though some later flashback episodes show Moe as having black hair when he was younger. Moe's bow-tie and apron were also originally pastel pink.

</li><li> In the first few seasons, DW's friend Emily wore a pink dress and had very short hair. She was eventually redesigned to wear a blue dress and have medium length hair.

For example, Johnny's design has a completely different shaped head, his skin is darker, and he has dark brown hair in a different hairstyle. There's concept art of early versions of the main cast that feature prototypical designs, but they didn't appear in the short. For example, Johnny's parents had different designs such as his mom being a blonde with a pixie cut, but they still had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife">housewife</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFiftiesFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFiftiesFather">Standard '50s Father</a> look to them.

In his first appearance in <em>Wise Little Hen</em>, the hat had a stiff brim, rather than the floppy hat he now has. Also, the hat was white until the early forties, and the bow on his collar changed from black to red. And for a brief period in the 1950s, the buttons on his shirt disappeared, also in his few several cartoons he had a slimmer body, long neck, and long bill.

The gloves were added later to make sure that you still see their hands even if they held them across their stomachs. Shortly after, they had shoes and gloves, and their eyes became simple black dots. In 1939, their eyes became more "human" eyes to give them more expression. Originally they had white skin however later they were changed to a more natural peach tone.
</li><li> Minnie also had a hat with a flower in it, but it was changed to a large bow by 1939. Traditionally she wore a skirt with no shirt however nowadays it's more common for her to wear a dress, though the skirt sometimes still appears.

Jerrica had a different haircut, wore pink and blue striped dress with a red belt, a hat and pink shoes, became white and blue striped with a white belt, without hat and blue shoes. Pizzazz received an bracelet, she lost a legband, and switched her sock to ther other leg.

<ul><li> The Dream Maker in particular, originally wearing a more humble patchwork robe, now wears a far more dignified attire. His hair now pointed upward instead of downward and his nose gained a more pronounced hook.
</li><li> Rufus and Amberley had more differentiating proportions (Rufus gained a bulkier upper body while Amberley became lankier) and had their clothing streamlined. The swords on both Rufus and the Urpneys' belts (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrnamentalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrnamentalWeapon">that they never used</a>) are now gone too.

</li><li> To a lesser degree Zordrak's robe changed from purple to blue, and Frizz lost his glasses with the exception of the blue lens tint, making it seem like he had blue eyes.
</li><li> Spildit had a longer snout and no irises in her earliest appearances. Oddly enough, Season Four animators kept zigzagging between her first and second designs.

</li><li> Patrick's eyebrows were extremely thin, narrow and rather crooked the first season, but his eyebrows soon became thick, straight and blocky from Season 2 onwards. He was also a bit fatter than what he would be later on.
</li><li> Mr. Krabs' eyelids were pink instead of red in the pilot short "Help Wanted". Squidward's skin was also a bluish-white color instead of cyan and his head was more pointy, resembling an actual squid rather than an octopus.

The pink mane has never canonically been referenced, leading fans to believe it was the result of the in-universe book illustrator trying to simplify Celestia's mane.
</li><li> The book <em>Ponyville Mysteries: Riddle of the Rusty Horseshoe</em> describes Lofty as a chubby pegasus and Holiday as a slender Earth pony. "The Last Crusade" introduces them in the cartoon with their weights swapped.

<ul><li> Pearl had the heaviest redesign. Her skin was blueish, her hair was shorter and longer on the top, her clothes were different, she wore earrings, and she had an overall more androgynous design. Pearl also had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">less mature and neurotic personality</a>, acting like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully">Big Sister Bully</a> towards Steven instead of an overprotective parent.

Eventually Happy Rabbit's mouth switched from apricot to white and thus, Bugs as we know him was born (though he received his name in 1939). While in his earlier appearances he looked more like a rabbit standing on twos, by 1943 he was streamlined.
</li><li> In several early shorts an unnamed black (or dark grey) cat with a white muzzle appeared. He is closest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SylvesterTheCatAndTweetyBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SylvesterTheCatAndTweetyBird">Sylvester</a> in the short <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCageyCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCageyCanary">The Cagey Canary</a></em>, where a prototypical Granny and an unnamed canary (proto-Tweety) also appeared.
</li><li> The prototypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd">Elmer Fudd</a> was a man who appeared in "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HareUmScareUm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HareUmScareUm">Hare Um Scare Um</a>" with purple bags under his eyes and medium length black hair, though some believe the character known as "Egghead" was the earliest version of Elmer. Elmer as we know him was much fatter in several early shorts as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IHaventGotAHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IHaventGotAHat">I Haven't Got a Hat</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig">Porky Pig</a> was presented as a juvenile pig in a green sweater. He looked more pig-like than he eventually came to become.
</li><li> Tweety started out as a featherless hatchling however due to objections about him being "naked" he was given feathers. He also gained eyelashes for the redesign, possibly to help distinguish him better as a child character or to make him even cuter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DefendersOfTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DefendersOfTheEarth">Defenders of the Earth</a></em>: In the first seventeen episodes (with the exception of "Root of Evil", in which the designs for most of the regular characters are markedly different from those used in the rest of the series) Jedda has brown hair. From "The Panther Peril" onwards, her hair is black.
</li><li> Most of the character designs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger">As Told by Ginger</a></em> pilot are completely different from in the series. Most glaringly, Miranda and Darren were white before being given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Race Lifts</a> to match their voice actors.
</li><li> Most characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> look the same throughout the series and only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> explains their minor differences, but there are exceptions, mostly from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons">Oh Yeah! Cartoons</a></em> shorts.
<ul><li> Tootie is the most obvious. In her first appearance, she wore a blue dress with pink leggings instead of a schoolgirl uniform, her glasses were pink instead of purple, and her pigtails were stylized differently.
</li><li> In her first appearance, the Tooth Fairy has red hair instead of blue.
</li><li> Cupid makes a cameo in "The Zappys", and he looks big with blonde hair and no shirt.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews">Hank Anchorman</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em> looked completely different in season 2 and beyond from when he was introduced in the season 1 episode "Johnny's Pink Plague". His appearance in the later seasons is actually an edited version of a robot anchorman that appears on TV for one scene in "Sonic Johnny".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>: When Dale's father Bug first appeared in the episode "Order of the Straight Arrow," he looked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyFamilyResemblance">pretty much exactly like his son</a>. However, when he finally made a full appearance in the Season 6 episode "My Own Private Rodeo," he was redesigned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> with a mustache.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>
<ul><li> The first episode, "Left in the Dark", had some small differences in character designs: mostly it's about how the characters' clothes are colored (Lola's dress is in a brighter shade of pink, Leni's dress is in a duller shade of teal, Luan's skirt, socks and scrunchie are a brighter, almost neon yellow and Lisa's sweater is a darker shade of green), but then there are Lana's hat (whose hole on the back is oval-shaped rather than rectangular) and Lucy's hairline (that leaves a bit of skin above her nose uncovered). <a class="urllink" href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/147/560/810.jpg">This promotional picture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> shows the designs used in that episode.

Other small design differences can be found in the poster<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note144w4b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note144w4b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note144w4b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Such as: everyone's eyelashes are disconnected from their eyes, Luna is missing her bracelets and her shirt has ripped sleeves, Luan has the entire upper row of her teeth exposed instead of just the two buck teeth, the bottom of Lisa's sweater has sharp edges, Lana's overalls are missing the buttons on the front, Lynn is missing the small tuft of hair behind her neck and Lucy's shoes are flats instead of slip-ons</span>
</li><li> In Season 1, Mr. and Mrs. Loud were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">The Faceless</a>, with only a few teasers here and there (such as the shadow of dad's face at the end of "It's a Loud, Loud, Loud, Loud House"). The Season 2 premiere revealed their faces towards the end, and since then they were constantly shown (except for three episodes that come before in production order but are aired later).
</li><li> When Sid Chang first appeared in the first few episodes of Season 4, she had no eyelashes. In the proper spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCasagrandes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCasagrandes">The Casagrandes</a></em>, she has two eyelashes per eye.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a> originally wore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail">Tomboyish Ponytail</a> when not wearing her supervillain costume. Later seasons changed her hairstyle to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">Girlish Pigtails</a> in order to emphasis her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Woman Child</a> traits and resemble her harlequin hat.
</li><li> The Scarecrow's design in his debut in <em>B: TAS</em> was different from what'd he's wear in other episodes during the <em>B: TAS</em> era, lacking the straw "hair" of the later design and sporting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankWhiteEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankWhiteEyes">Blank White Eyes</a>.

<ul><li> In Season 1, Superman and Wonder Woman sported cheekbones, which made them look older than they were supposed to be. Realizing this, especially as Superman's design was criticized by fans for excessive lines, their designs were tweaked to remove the cheekbones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a> initially sported a design that seemed vaguely inspired by her look from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush">Batman: Hush</a></em>, but was otherwise completely new (complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueLenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueLenses">Opaque Lenses</a>, a stylized "H" emblem on her crotch, and a differently-colored cape and mask).

The Jungle Movie</a></em>, her head was more circular and wore a green tank.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">Life With Loopy</a></em> pilot "Goldfish Heaven", Larry wore a long-sleeved orange shirt with a red jersey over it and olive green pants. For the rest of the series, he wears tan striped pants and alternated between wearing a long-sleeved red shirt with blue and yellow stripes and a white t-shirt with a red flannel shirt. Loopy's hair beads were also constructed as part of her head in "Goldfish Heaven" rather than separate like in all other episodes. Her eyes were also a brighter shade of blue in the pilot. All the characters also had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands">Four-Fingered Hands</a> in the pilot; they have five in the rest of the show.

Cartoons</a></em>:
<ul><li> XJ9/Jenny's hands were the same color as her hair and "clothes", she had lips, and her skirt had rivets on the bottom.
</li><li> Dr. Wakeman had a different hairstyle and a slightly less cartoonish design in addition to her clothes being completely white.
</li></ul></li><li> In earlier episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow">The Super Mario Bros Super Show!</a></em>, Toad's hat was red with white spots. After a while, it was changed to a videogame-accurate white hat with red spots.
</li><li> In the pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AaahhRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AaahhRealMonsters">Aaahh!!! Real Monsters</a></em>, Ickis wore glasses. He was even included in a Nickelodeon trivia question about which characters wore glasses. He doesn't have them in the series proper (although in at least one episode a close up on his face implies he wears contacts.)
</li><li> In season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SchoolForVampires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SchoolForVampires">School For Vampires</a></em>, Sunshine wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperTightsWithASkirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperTightsWithASkirt">white tights</a>.

<ul><li> Lady Richington had a burlier appearance, lacked a necklace and bracelets, and wore a differently-shaped wig.
</li><li> General Specific had hair on his temples and the brim of his hat was colored black instead of green.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first three seasons of the Dutch cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PurnoDePurno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PurnoDePurno">Purno de Purno</a></em>, recurring characters Sjakie and Kiet were more humanoid in appearance. Starting from Season 4, both of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">now-main characters</a> basically became walking versions of their heads.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> series has Beth, who wore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BracesOfOrthodonticOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BracesOfOrthodonticOverkill">Braces of Orthodontic Overkill</a> during her <em>Island</em> run as a competitor before she had them taken off from <em>Action</em> onwards.
</li><li> Perhaps the most extreme example would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a></em>, who in his earliest shorts had a red belly (instead of white) and green tail feathers (instead of blue). He also had buck teeth, fat legs and no gloves.
</li><li> The titular hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> lacked his iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestInsignia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestInsignia">Chest Insignia</a> for all of the first season.
</li><li> In the original pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers">The Angry Beavers</a></em>, "Snowbound", Norb looked more like a yellow version of his brother Daggett in contrast to his more diverse appearance of having spikier hair.
</li><li> In the first few seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, a lot of the characters had noticeable "thin-line" eyebrows, which disappeared completely by the third season, sans Stewie.
<ul><li> Chris originally wore earrings, which came from one of his earlier designs as a punk rocker, which also vanished after two seasons.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMansion">Super Mansion</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">Cooch</a> had a very different and much larger hairstyle from what she has from the second episode onward.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madeline">Madeline</a></em>, Lord Cucuface looks completely different in his debut in <em>Madeline's Rescue</em> than he does in the subsequent series. In the special he's thinner, with a narrow face, a long thin nose, gray hair and a gray mustache and goatee. In the series he's portlier, with a blocky face and big rounded nose, and his hair, mustache and goatee are just wisps. The design change corresponds with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">friendlier characterization</a> in the series.
</li><li> A notable example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog">Underdog</a></em> is Simon Bar Sinister's henchman Cad Lackey, whose complexion was pale in "Go Snow", "The Big Shrink and "Weathering the Storm". From "The Phoney Booths" onward, in addition to a few other tweaks, including a fuller hairdo, Cad gained a healthier complexion.
