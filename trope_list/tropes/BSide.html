</div></div><p>Often when bands release a single, they want to put a little extra on there for the fans. It so happens that back in the days of the 45 rpm record, there was a whole half of the vinyl record left over for the extra music; the side with the main song on it was the "A-side" and the side with the rest on is the B-side.
</p><p>Even today, now that the 45 rpm single is more-or-less extinct outside of a niche community of vinyl enthusiasts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">the terminology persists</a>. A B-side is a song released alongside a single. It may be a good song that doesn't fit in with an album (or recorded for the single), is not good enough for release on an album, something too experimental to be commercially viable on its own, or just a joke. It could be a song written by a young up-and-coming songwriter, or a cover of a pop, country, jazz or R&amp;B standard. It could also be a different version of the A-Side (i.e., instrumental, a cappella, remix, a different language, acoustic, etc.).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The single is usually denoted as "A-side b/w B-side", the b/w standing for 'backed with'.
</p><p>Occasionally, both sides of the single are promoted equally; the single is then called a "double A-side". Famous examples are "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions</a>". B-sides may be collected onto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits albums</a>, or be included on an extra disc for deluxe reissues and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxSet">Box Sets</a>. They might also turn up as bonus tracks on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">later printings of the album</a>.
</p><p>In Japan, this is a requirement for many bands, in order to control grey-market imports. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">It backfired</a>. The Japanese Editions are among the most wanted (and thus, among the most pirated) editions of the albums. In the past, it was a convention that European B-sides would contain non-album tracks (often outtakes or covers), while American singles would usually feature a second album track.

Since the B-side got 50% of the airplay royalties, the publishers would clean up.
</p><p>B-side songs may well become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hits</a>. Even if they don't, it's not uncommon for them to become staples of an artist's live repertoire and even become fan favorites.

<ul><li> An entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown">American Country Countdown</a></em> program (a special that aired Oct. 4, 1975, in place of that weekend's regular countdown) was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.popsike.com/American-Country-Countdown-10475-B-Sides-Special/110311141408.html">dedicated to B-sides of country music<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The special featured classic gems by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>, Patsy Cline, Hank Williams Sr., Lefty Frizzell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>, Ray Price, Hank Snow, Kitty Wells, Eddy Arnold, Merle Haggard and many others. The top song: "The Tennessee Waltz," as recorded by Patti Page.
</li><li> Hank Williams Sr. had multiple B-sided hits, plus one that never charted but has gone on to be one of his all-time classic performances and most covered:
<ul><li> <strong>1949</strong>
<ul><li> "Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door)," backed "Lovesick Blues."
</li><li> "Lost Highway," which backed "You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)."
</li><li> "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," backed "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It." Initially — according to at least one Time-Life Records compilation this song is included on — "I'm So Lonesome ... " was virtually ignored when "Bucket" was first released, unlike many other Hank B-sides. But then, in 1966, a handsome young country and pop singer from Hugo, Oklahoma, named B.J. Thomas recorded the song about loneliness in a troubled relationship, and Williams' song finally got the recognition it deserved, with Thomas reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. All of a sudden, country disc jockeys began playing Williams' original version (and sometimes, Thomas' new version as well), and although it never charted, finally was heard and appreciated. In the years since, more than 300 performers have recorded "I'm So Lonesome ... ."
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>1950</strong>
<ul><li> "My Son Calls Another Man Daddy," backed "Long Gone Lonesome Blues."
</li><li> "They'll Never Take Her Love from Me" backed "Why Should We Try Anymore."
</li><li> "Nobody's Lonesome for Me," backing "Moanin' the Blues."
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>1951</strong>
<ul><li> "Dear John," the flip side to the all-time classic "Cold, Cold Heart."
</li><li> "I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)," backed "Howlin' at the Moon."
</li><li> "Crazy Heart," the other side of a lonesome song called "(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle."
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>1952</strong>
<ul><li> "You Win Again," backed "Settin' the Woods on Fire."
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>1953</strong>
<ul><li> Perhaps his biggest two-sided hit ever — "Your Cheatin' Heart," backing "Kaw-Liga." Both were multi-week No. 1 country hits, with "Kaw-Liga" becoming the biggest country hit of 1953.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The B-side to 1970s pop singer Andy Kim's No. 1 hit "Rock Me Gently" was ... an instrumental of "Rock Me Gently." (It was simply the same music track, minus Kim's vocals.) This became <em>very</em> common in the years to come.
</li><li> The B-side to Napoleon XIV's "They're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa!" was called "!aaaH-aH yawA eM ekaT ot gnimoC er'yehT" and was a backwards version of the A-side. For added effect, most of the information on the 45 label is printed backwards.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage">Spitting Image</a> single "The Chicken Song" b/w "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">I've Never Met a Nice South African</a>" was jokingly promoted on the cover as a "double B-side", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">implying that both songs were of dubious quality</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">Marvin</a> released a "Double B Side" too.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8L_LbyE-cg">Dance You Fuckers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WallOfVoodoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WallOfVoodoo">Wall of Voodoo</a> is over 5 minutes long and the most awesome track both line-ups ever recorded.
</li><li> By his own admission, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperCarrott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperCarrott">Jasper Carrott</a>'s "Funky Moped" only charted as a hit single because the B-side had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedKidsShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedKidsShow">risqué</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a></em> sketch.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s B-sides are popular among fans for their strangeness and experimentation; "Kinetic" features a looped, backwards, slowed-down vocal part.
</li><li> Muse's B Sides are popular amongst fans. The most popular is Fury, which the band have played live, and Matt wanted on Absolution but the band voted him out. The band have a compilation called Hullabaloo which collects several of their B Sides, and another one called Random 1-8 which covers similar ground but has a couple of exceptions. Other popular B Sides include Agitated (a funk-thrash song that was a live staple for years), Eternally Missed (A 6 minute long epic that was in the running for Absolution but left off due to length), Nishe (a moody instrumental which the band still do live), and the band's cover of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You", (which even got radio airplay in the UK).
</li><li> The Protomen released a white vinyl record roughly one year prior to releasing their Act II CD with the single "Father of Death". The other side contained a remixed version of "No Easy Way Out" from Rocky IV.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur">Blur</a> have so many b-sides, that the situation is very close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic">Archive Panic</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur">Blur</a> recorded so often that they'd have brand new songs to release as B Sides, and not have to put out anything substandard (something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a> also did). This was particularly common during the "Leisure" and "Modern Life Is Rubbish" periods. In the case of the former, the more mature "Inertia" and "Luminous" were released as B Sides before "Leisure" came out, despite being recorded after it.
</li><li> Their Japan only release The Special Collectors' Edition which collects B Sides up to the Parklife singles. In terms of box sets, they have the more substantial 10th Anniversary Collection and the even more substantial Blur 21 set (of which all the albums were released as 2CD sets including most of the B Sides).
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a> has a few of these from the Anette era, notably "The Escapist" and "While Your Lips are Still Red."
<ul><li> "Wish I Had an Angel" was backed with a cover of Ankie Bagger's "Where Were You Last Night".
</li></ul></li><li> Self's "No B-sides": The back story is that Matt Mahaffey of Self was streaming one B-side (more accurately "outtake") from forthcoming album <em>Ornament And Crime</em> a day until the album's release date. When the anticipated release date came and the album didn't, the song for the day was "No B-sides", a catchy, jingle-like number where Mahaffey informed fans that there weren't any b-sides left, the album was delayed by record label issues but was still going to come out, and if anyone pirated the streaming songs in mp3 form, he would personally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a> them. Now that <em>Ornament And Crime</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a>, the song is a mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"Funny Aneurysm" Moment</a>.
</li><li> The B-side of Three Dog Night's "Shambala" was called, appropriately enough, "Our B-Side". The lyrics had the band speculating what they might do if they ever got to write a song that ended up as an A-side (since Three Dog Night almost exclusively recorded songs by established outside songwriters).
</li><li> The original "Garage Days Revisited" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>. This was the B-side to the European release of "Creeping Death," and contained two covers, "Am I Evil?" (originally by Diamond Head) and "Blitzkrieg," by the group of the same name. Metallica would use the "Garage" name for a number of future cover-based releases, and would release many NWOBHM cover tunes as B-sides (later collected into the "Garage, Inc." album).
</li><li> Birmingham stand-up comic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperCarrott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperCarrott">Jasper Carrott</a> had a hit single with a mildly diverting funny song called <em>Funky Moped</em>. However, what people were <em>really</em> buying it for was a B-side that because of content could not be broadcast on the radio: an adult-themed version of popular children's animation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a></em>, in which, among other things, aspersions are cast as to prim and proper Florence's sexual preferences.
</li><li> The B-side of Yes's "Leave It" was the same song <em>a capella.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWhitley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWhitley">Keith Whitley</a> had <em>three</em> B-sides that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> by other artists - two of which were themselves covers (see the notes):

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> had quite a few B-sided hits as well:
<ul><li> "Five Feet High and Risin'" — the flip side to the original studio version of "I Got Stripes" was a childhood memory of Johnny's. A harsh winter of 1936-1937 gave way to record rainfall and flooding in the Arkansas Mississippi Valley, and the result was water that kept rising, seemingly by the minute and hour, as entire farms — crops, livestock, buildings (including farmhouses) and all — and communities were washed away and dozens of people were killed. Eventually, the Cash family was forced to flee to higher ground to safety until the river crested and began to drop below flood stage.
</li><li> Examples from his Sun Records days: "Hey Porter" (backed "Cry, Cry, Cry"); "So Doggone Lonesome" (backed the original "Folsom Prison Blues"), "Get Rhythm (the flipper was the famous "I Walk the Line"), "Big River" (turn it over to get "Ballad of a Teenage Queen")
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard">Merle Haggard</a>: Lots:
<ul><li> To "The Legend Of Bonnie and Clyde," his fourth No. 1 hit from the spring of 1968, came the critically acclaimed "Today I Started Loving You Again."
</li><li> Briefly, when released in June 1969, "Silver Wings" was the A-side to the working man's anthem "Working Man's Blues." The two were flipped within two weeks of release, and while "Working Man's Blues" eventually went to No. 1, many radio stations still played "Silver Wings," a song that took Merle in a new direction: a pop-styled lament about loneliness on the road.
</li><li> The flip side his 1976 No. 1, the nostalgic "My Roots Of My Raising," was the equally nostalgic "The Way It Was In '51." "Roots ..." was a longing for home, while "... '51" was a yearning for the simpler, carefree days of just 25 years earlier. "... '51" went on to become a minor country hit in 1978, based on airplay.
</li><li> "If We Make It Through December," not explicitly a Christmas single despite many references to the holiday — it was much more a lament about being laid off and enduring other majorly disappointing news just before the holidays — did have a more blatant holiday tune for the B-side: "Bobby Wants a Puppy Dog For Christmas," a song about a young boy who, living in a community where there are no boys his age (it's unclear whether he was an only child or much younger than his siblings) yearns for a dog for companionship and friendship.
</li><li> Other flippers were listed along with many of Merle's songs, but are lesser known today. For instance, "Cherokee Maiden," a tribute to Bob Wills, had "What Have You Got Planned Tonight, Diana?" "Turning Off a Memory" was listed on the B-side of "Grandma Harp."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePostalService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePostalService">The Postal Service</a> only had a couple of b-sides that were original songs ("Be Still My Heart" and "There's Never Enough Time"), the rest being remixes and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion">Cover Version</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips">Flaming Lips</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSoftBulletin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSoftBulletin">"Suddenly Everything Has Changed"</a>. What was more unusual was that the "Such Great Heights" single included other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SubPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SubPop">Sub Pop</a>-affiliated artists covering <em>their</em> songs - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronAndWine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronAndWine">Iron and Wine</a> performing the title track and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheShins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheShins">The Shins</a> performing "We Will Become Silhouettes". Iron And Wine's version of "Such Great Heights" became fairly well-known on it's own when it was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GardenState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GardenState">Garden State</a></em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a> released four singles during their career as an active band, with extremely varied B-sides.
<ul><li> "Anarchy in the UK," their debut single, was backed with "I Wanna Be Me," a throwaway early song from a demo session some months earlier whose inclusion on the single is probably the most notable thing about it.
</li><li> "God Save the Queen," taken from the sessions that produced Never Mind the Bollocks, was backed with "Did You No Wrong," another song from the sessions that didn't end up on the album. The song originated as "Scarface" from when Steve, Paul and Glen were performing with Wally Nightingale as the Swankers. Since the group was essentially a pub-rock group before John Lydon became the singer, it's instrumentally a pretty straightforward rock 'n' roll song with Lydon's punk vocal and rewritten lyrics laid on top.
</li><li> "Pretty Vacant" had a cover of the Stooges' "No Fun" on the B-side. This was taken from the sessions where they first attempted to record the "Anarchy in the UK" single, which also happened to include a string of covers recorded live in the studio, the rest of which would surface on various bootlegs and film soundtracks in later years. It's an incredibly strong and spontaneous performance, especially considering that the band had just learned the song. It's also the longest single song they ever recorded: the full version comes in just under seven minutes, but the B-side edit cuts out the last 30 seconds or so of the chaotic AC/DC-esque ending.
</li><li> "Holidays in the Sun" features another cut from the Bollocks sessions that was left off the album, a recording of "Satellite," an older song about playing unpleasant gigs in small towns around London in the band's early days, trying to build a following. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's a fine song and a damned energetic performance that really benefits from the bigger-budget production and fuller sound available to the band at the time of recording.
</li></ul></li><li> Anyone who bought Dion's sentimental, patriotic 1968 hit "Abraham, Martin &amp; John" and flipped the record over suffered a huge case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>; the B-side was a much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> electric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues">Blues</a> song called "Daddy Rollin' (In Your Arms)".
</li><li> Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, there were several methods to ensure the intended song got radio airplay instead of the B-side:
<ul><li> Putting a quickly-recorded, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">not particularly great</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Instrumentals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Instrumentals">Instrumental</a> on the B-side. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector">Phil Spector</a> in particular was notorious for this. His protégé <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonnyBono" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonnyBono">Sonny Bono</a> adopted this for his productions, using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a> device of mentioning <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzal">quetzals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> somewhere in the title.
</li><li> Putting an instrumental version of the A-side song on the B-side. This has backfired at least once: the B-side of Cliff Nobles' "Love Is All Right" was its instrumental version under the title "The Horse" — the latter (not featuring Nobles) became a #2 hit in 1968 while the former was ignored.
</li><li> Only including the A-side song on promotional copies sent to radio stations, whether by leaving the B-side blank or by putting the A-side song on both sides. When stereo on 45rpm records returned in the late 1960's (following a brief experiment in 1958-61), some promotional copies would have the same song in stereo on one side (for FM-Stereo stations) and in mono on the other side (for AM stations).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers">Kenny Rogers</a> had two examples, both from 1984:
<ul><li> "This Woman"/"Buried Treasure". While the former was a #23 pop hit and #2 on the AC charts, country radio preferred the B-side "Buried Treasure", and it went to #3 on the country charts at the same time.
</li><li> "Evening Star"/"Midsummer Nights" from the same album was sent to country radio as a double A-side.
</li></ul></li><li> The European single release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCranberries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCranberries">The Cranberries</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">"Zombie"</a> was backed with "Away", which was featured in the film <em>'<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless">Clueless</a></em>, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">not included on its soundtrack album</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItaloDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItaloDisco">Italo Disco</a>/spacesynth duo Laserdance have "Galactica" backing "Laserdance Ultimate '88 Remix", and "Fall of the Wall" on "Megamix Vol. 3". The former was produced by Peter Vriends under the alias Andromeda, while the latter sounds like an outtake from the <em>Discovery Trip</em> sessions, and was also used for the intro and outtro of "Megamix Vol. 4".
</li><li> British instrumental rock group The Shadows did a similar "double B-side" gag to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage">Spitting Image</a></em> single up above with their "The Dreams I Dream" b/w "Scotch on the Socks" single in 1966. The promotional copies had a big red "B" on the labels, parodying the standard EMI promo label design of the time that had a big red "A" on the A-side.
</li><li> Helalyn Flowers' "E-Race Generation", from <em>A Voluntary Coincidence</em>, in addition to being a double A-side with "Voices" from said album, was B-sided by "Teargas", which is one of their few songs to not be included on an album or EP.
</li><li> Void Vision has "Black and White" for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">limited 7" vinyl release</a> of her debut "In 20 Years", and "20-20" for "Sour".
</li><li> Originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama">Alabama</a>'s "If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)" was the B-side to "I'm Not That Way Anymore". But due to radio showing more interest in the former, the sides were reversed after two weeks.
</li><li> In 1981, John Anderson released "Chicken Truck" and a cover of Lefty Frizzell's "I Love You a Thousand Ways" as a double A-side. Radio preferred the former, getting it to #8 on the country charts while the latter stalled out at #54. But in Canada, the reverse was true: "Chicken Truck" was not released there at all, so "I Love You a Thousand Ways" got the bigger radio push, making #11 on the <em>RPM</em> Country Tracks charts.
</li><li> Originally, Mark McGuinn's debut single was supposed to be "That's a Plan". However, stations were showing interest in the track "Mrs. Steven Rudy" instead, so that became the lead single and "That's a Plan" was relegated to the B-side. "Mrs. Steven Rudy" went on to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">McGuinn's only hit</a>.
</li><li> In 1971, italian singer Domenico Modugno (of <em>Volare</em> fame) wrote a song for the Sanremo Music Festival. When the song was released as a single, Modugno put on the other side <em>Questa è la facciata B</em> ("This is the B-side"): three minutes of random chatting and instrumental improvisations where, at some point, Modugno says "Well guys, since nobody listen the B-side of the Sanremo record, I didn't write the song at all".
</li><li> The Murmaids' one big hit, "Popsicles and Icicles", was issued with <em>four</em> different B-sides in the U.S. In order of appearance, they were "Blue Dress", "Bunny Stomp" (an instrumental), "Comedy and Tragedy" (a recording by another group released under the Murmaids' name) and "Huntington Flats" (another instrumental). Most non-U.S. releases of the single used "Comedy and Tragedy" as the B-side.
</li><li> Gary Lewis and the Playboys' "This Diamond Ring" was originally released with the instrumental "Hard to Find" as the B-side, a composition of jazz bassist Leroy Vinnegar. A few weeks later, the B-side was changed to "Tijuana Wedding", another instrumental. The composers of a B-side earned an equal amount of royalties on every single sold as the composers of an A-side, and the new B-side happened to be composed by Gary Lewis, his producer Snuff Garrett and his arranger Leon Russell.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre">Jean-Michel Jarre</a>'s "Moon Machine" was originally composed for <em>Zoolook</em>, but rejected due to not fitting with said album's theme. Instead, he released it as a B-side to "Rendez-Vous IV".
</li><li> Paul Hardcastle's US 12" single of "19" was backed with "The Asylum (It's Weird)". The UK editions of the single had one or two other non-album tracks; "Fly By Night" and "Dolores", and sometimes all three together as a medley.
</li><li> The B-side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TraceyUllman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TraceyUllman">Tracey Ullman</a>' hit cover of "They Don't Know" was a skit titled "The B-Side" in which Ullman played various characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussing B-sides</a>.
</li><li> When the cast of the musical TV drama <em>Rock Follies of '77</em> had a hit single with the rock song "O.K.?", the flipside was a song titled "The B-Side", a solo ballad in which, very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a>, one of the characters laments being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserStar">Lesser Star</a> of the band and therefore having her contribution relegated to the B-side.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IreneCara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IreneCara">Irene Cara</a>'s "Flashdance...What a Feeling" from ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flashdance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flashdance">Flashdance</a> was backed with Helen St. John's "Love Theme from Flashdance (Instrumental)" on its 7" single, and "Found It" on the 12".
</li><li> The B-side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s 1969 single "Man of the World" was "Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite" by the mysterious Earl Vince &amp; The Valiants, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback">Genre Throwback</a> rock'n'roll number that got very excited about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">the prospect of a forthcoming riot</a>. Who were these young upstarts? As it turned out, Earl Vince &amp; The Valiants were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand">Fake Band</a>. It was actually Fleetwood Mac themselves having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfGenreExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfGenreExperience">Out-of-Genre Experience</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s 1980 solo single "Coming Up" had a live version of the same song by his (by-then effectively disbanded) group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Wings</a> on the B-side. The actual A-side was a big hit around the world, but the US market preferred the B-side and made <em>that</em> the hit instead.

During the Showbiz era, the band released a Japanese tour EP called Random 1-8, which had a similar tracklisting to Hullabaloo (sans the Origin Of Symmetry era B Sides), but also had Agitated, a live version of Do We Need This, as well as three Sunburn mixes which were hidden tracks.

</li><li> <em> &amp; Giggles</em> by the Kleptones is a 2010 compilation of Kleptones b-sides from 2004 to the present day. The catch is that, as a mash-up artist, all of his albums have been released online for free and they've never had a proper "single".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> are notorious for producing a ton of songs that don't quite make it onto their albums, though this is mainly because they release a new album every four years on average as of late.

The band actually had plans to release a third album, but had to cut over ten songs at the insistence of management.
</li><li> To accompany their tenth album <em>I'm With You</em> (which contained 14 songs), the band released an unofficial series of tracks called <em>I'm Beside You</em>, with no less than <strong>17</strong> songs that didn't make it onto the album.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sloan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sloan">Sloan</a> released a compilation of them, along with bonus tracks, called <em>B Sides Win: extras, bonus tracks and b-sides 1992-2008</em>.

The last of these is a digital-only release that contains <em>114</em> tracks, and it still wasn't complete as of the time of its issue (and, because plenty of additional material has been unearthed from the band's vaults for the band's recent deluxe reissues of its discography, it's even less complete now). It's fair to say that Billy Corgan is one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Double A-sides </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">Hank Williams</a> had several two-sided hits, but his best known was "Kaw-Liga"/"Your Cheatin' Heart," both which went No. 1 in 1953, several months after his death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>: Also famous for scoring with dual-sided hits, his most famous was one of popular music's all-time most popular songs — from 1956, "Don't Be Cruel"/"Hound Dog." Both sides of this double A-sided hit were No. 1 on all three of the major charts — the Top 100 (as <em>Billboard</em> magazine called it at the time), the country, and the rhythm and blues charts. Incidentally, the song's designation as a double-A single didn't come until 1960.
<ul><li> Much like Linda Ronstadt as mentioned below, Elvis started using the strategy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> of having one side of a single aimed at the Pop market, and the other targeted at the Country audience, like with "Moody Blue" (Pop) and "She Thinks I Still Care" (Country), though the Pop side often ended up getting more airplay on Country radio anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a> had several, including "It's All Wrong, but It's All Right"/"Two Doors Down" and "Baby I'm Burning"/"I Really Got the Feeling". Both sides went to #1.
</li><li> Razzy Bailey also had two #1 singles with double A-sides: "I Keep Coming Back"/"True Life Country Music" and "Friends"/"Anywhere There's a Jukebox". "Midnight Hauler" also went to #1, with its b-side "Scratch My Back" reaching #8 soon afterward.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindaRonstadt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindaRonstadt">Linda Ronstadt</a> had several double A-sided hits in 1975 and 1976 alone, allowing her to have as many as six top 10 hits (divided between the country and Hot 100 charts) within a year's span:
<ul><li> <strong>Early 1975</strong>: The single "You're No Good"/"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)." "You're No Good" (with a searing rock guitar solo from Andrew Gold) topped the Hot 100 in February 1975, right around the same time the flip side — a cover of a classic Hank Williams Sr. song <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jchi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jchi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jchi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(and one of more than 150 cover versions)</span> — peaked at No. 2 on the country chart; the Hank Sr. cover included vocal harmonies from her good friend, Emmylou Harris. (And yes, both sides got airplay on both country and pop radio.)
</li><li> <strong>June 1975</strong>: "When Will I Be Loved," a soaring cover of the Everly Brothers' hit from 15 years earlier, was backed with "It Doesn't Matter Anymore." Although the flip side didn't chart on its own, it did get lots of airplay in both the country and Top 40 genres, going to No. 1 country and No. 2 Hot 100.
</li><li> <strong>October 1975</strong>: "Heat Wave"/"Love is a Rose." "Heat Wave" was a No. 5 hit, and Ronstadt's cover of the old Martha and the Vandellas smash from the early 1960s. "Love is a Rose," a cover of a Neil Young-penned album track, was the side of choice for country radio. Incidentally, <em>both</em> songs stopped at No. 5 on the Hot 100 and Hot Country Singles charts, respectively.
</li><li> <strong>February 1976</strong>: "The Sweetest Gift"/"Tracks of My Tears." Again, released to both country and rock radio stations, "The Sweetest Gift" — with Emmylou Harris providing backing vocals — got the nod early on at country radio, but it wasn't long before the pop side "Tracks of My Tears" (covering Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles) earned its keep at country radio and (depending on the chart) made the top 10 or stopped just short.
</li><li> <strong>November 1977</strong>: Some pressings of "Blue Bayou" (top 5 both country and Hot 100) had as the flip side the Warren Zevon-penned "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me," the latter which became a top 30 pop hit.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a> released a single in 1975 that ultimately became a double A-sided hit  "Touch the Hand"/"Don't Cry, Joni." The two songs were subsequent hits, with "Touch the Hand" (a ballad) becoming the first hit, becoming a No. 1 country hit in the summer of 1975. As that song's popularity began falling off, there came "Don't Cry, Joni," a tale about a 15-year-old girl's infatuation with her 22-year-old neighbor, his rejection of her, and  several years later, after realizing she may have been the girl for him all along  returning home to start a relationship but learning that she had wed his best friend. "Don't Cry, Joni," whose female vocal was by Joni Lee James (Twitty's daughter), became a top 5 hit that fall.
</li><li> Don Williams, country music's "Gentle Giant," had one of his earliest major successes in the late spring through summer of 1973 with a double A-sided hit, "Come Early Morning" and "Amanda." The double-sided hit never got any higher than No. 12 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, but like Kris Kristofferson on the Hot 100 in 1973 with his memorable spiritual "Why Me," it was one of those crazy occurrences where the song was popular in one area of the country early on, then caught on in a different region and/or at different radio stations just a few weeks later; toward the end of the run, "Amanda" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4jqzg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4jqzg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4jqzg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(the Bob McDill-penned song, not the rock song recorded by Boston that was a No. 1 pop hit in 1986)</span> was the listed A-side because that was the song getting more airplay than "Come Early Morning." That allowed the two-sided "Come Early Morning"/"Amanda" to spend 19 weeks in the top 40 (an extended run for any country hit at that time even for a No. 1 song <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note57uo1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note57uo1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note57uo1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(as at this time, 12 and 15 weeks was the average)</span>), but thanks to its long run and general all-around popularity, "Come Early Morning"/"Amanda" was the No. 5 song of the entire year on the Hot Country Singles chart. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ie21');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ie21" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ie21');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which, by the way, was the last time a song failing to reach the top 10 of the chart ever ranked as high on a year-end chart. Even more amazingly, "Amanda" was the listed song at No. 5 ... despite its own individual peak of No. 33.</span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7h98b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7h98b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7h98b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A postscript to "Amanda": The song is better known today in its 1979 cover version by Waylon Jennings.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a>'s "Reason To Believe"/"Maggie May", already listed below under "Famous songs that were originally B-sides", is similar to the Twitty single especially in terms of the second song's subject matter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> did this with the first single release from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HistoryPastPresentAndFutureBookI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HistoryPastPresentAndFutureBookI">HIStory: Past, Present And Future, Book I</a></em>, "Scream"/"Childhood".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Wings</a> had the double A side "Mull of Kintyre"/"Girls School". "Mull of Kintyre" was massively popular in the UK, while "Girls School" was ignored; in the USA, "Girls School" was a hit and nobody remembers "Mull of Kintyre".
</li><li> The commercial single of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a>'s "No News" (their second single) was a double A-side with its predecessor, "Tequila Talkin'."
</li><li> "We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>, both from their LP <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewsOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewsOfTheWorld">News of the World</a></em>, are usually played one after the other on radio stations.
</li><li> Since mainstream radio tended to avoid anything with blatant drug references, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pulp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pulp">Pulp</a> deliberately paired "Sorted For E's and Wizz" with the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioFriendliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioFriendliness">radio friendly</a> "Mis-shapes".
</li><li> Some acts have deliberately paired Christmas and non-Christmas songs as double A sides, so that there's still something for radio to play (and with a bit of luck, attract a few more buyers) come New Year. One particularly successful example was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wham">Wham!</a>'s "Last Christmas"/"Everything She Wants".
</li><li> Another double A-sided Christmas release was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama">Alabama</a>'s 1982 hit "Christmas in Dixie", paired up with "Christmas Is Just a Song for Us This Year" by Louise Mandrell (Barbara Mandrell's sister) and R.C. Bannon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEverlyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEverlyBrothers">The Everly Brothers</a> had a bunch in their heyday, often with a ballad on one side (ostensibly meant to appeal to female fans) and an uptempo song (for male fans) on the other. "Bird Dog" (uptempo) and "Devoted to You" (ballad) is a notable example.
</li><li> B-sides by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> quite often became big hits in their own right, but "We Can Work it Out"/"Day Tripper", "Yellow Submarine"/"Eleanor Rigby", "Penny Lane"/"Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Come Together"/"Something" were all officially considered double A-sides. On November 15, 1969, "Come Together" was #2 and "Something" was right behind at #3 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100. Finally <em>Billboard</em> decided to just change their policy and start listing a popular B-side along with the A-side, and two weeks later they combined as a #1 hit. <em>Billboard</em> also charted "The Long and Winding Road" and "For You Blue" as a double-A side.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Famous songs that were originally B-sides </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> From the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown">American Country Countdown</a></em> B-Sides Special came these songs where the B-side/intended B-side was the hit:
<ul><li> "The Jamestown Ferry" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TanyaTucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TanyaTucker">Tanya Tucker</a>, from 1972. The original A-side, "Love's the Answer" was not the answer to what would be the follow-up to the 14-year-old Tucker's first hit, "Delta Dawn."
<ul><li> In introducing the song, ACC host Don Bowman explained that by the late 1960s, record companies were servicing radio stations with vinyl 45 RPM records having the same song on both sides of the records, that is, a specific song the record company and/or artist wanted radio stations to play. (Plus, it allowed jockeys to play the other side of the record once one side became worn or "skipped.") <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note86xud');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note86xud" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note86xud');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">By this method, if the song flopped, it was no big deal; the song would fall into recurrent status and a new single would be released.</span> However, "Love's the Answer"/"The Jamestown Ferry" was an exception, since — according to Bowman — there seemed to be uncertainty at Columbia Records which song would be the stronger hit, so the label sent out copies of what also went to the stores.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Tennessee Waltz" by Patti Page, from 1950. The song was issued that October, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs">"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus"</a> as the A-side. The story was that, with only about an hour left in Page's recording session for the day, they would record "Waltz," put it on the B-side and forget about it. When the record sold better than expected, months before the holiday rush, someone asked why fans were loving "Boogie Woogie Santa Claus." It turned out they loved the B-side — a cover of a then 2-year-old Pee Wee King song, with vocals by Redd Stewart — instead ... and it was the B-side that became Page's signature song and about 15 years later one of Tennessee's state songs.
</li><li> "My Special Angel" by Bobby Helms, from 1957. The intended A-side, as the follow-up to "Fraulein," was "Standing at the End of My World." "... End of My World" was a flop, but it wasn't the end of that particular record by country radio, as disc jockeys found the real hit on the other side.
</li><li> "He'll Have to Go" by Jim Reeves, from early 1960. The original A'er was a nice ballad called "In a Mansion Stands My Love." Like "... End of My World," "Mansion" flopped. The jockeys flipped the record over and found what went on to become a country standard.
</li><li> "Big Bad John" by Jimmy Dean, from 1961. The original A-side was a cover of one of Stuart Hamblein's last drinking songs, "I Won't Go Huntin' With You Jake (But I'll Go On Chasing Women)." In the years since, Dean's cover version has gotten some classic country radio airplay. However, it was — both then and now — the B-side where jockeys and the public found a memorable tale of a miner who sacrifices his own life to save the lives of several hundred of his fellow miners.
</li><li> "Release Me" by Ray Price, from 1954. The Cherokee Cowboy had a few hits under his belt during the previous four years but not that one, definitive breakthrough. The original A-side, "I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)" did OK, but it was "Release Me" that became the real hit. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9rk10');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9rk10" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9rk10');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Incidentally, it was a cover version by Gail Davies 27 years later when "I'll Be There" finally became a hit.)</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Artie Shaw's 1938 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBand">Big Band</a> instrumental rendition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColePorter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColePorter">Cole Porter</a>'s "Begin the Beguine", originally relegated to a B-side due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords">RCA Records</a>' lack of faith in the tune's commercial potential, went on to become the first major hit for Shaw and one of the defining records of its era.
</li><li> Tom T. Hall's 1975 No. 1 country hit "Sneaky Snake." The original A-side (and one most often listed as the No. 1 hit) was a ballad called "I Care," but not too many cared about that song. Instead, disc jockeys, country music radio listeners and the record-buying public instead liked "The Storyteller's" flip-side silly story about a snake (metaphorically so) who had a fondness for others' root beer and girlfriends. "Sneaky Snake" was a rare novelty song to become a major country hit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a>'s "Maggie May," with the first A-side being "Reason to Believe." While "Reason to Believe" gained airplay during the summer of 1971, it wasn't long before "Maggie May"  the song about a young adult's infatuation and mixed emotions over his infatuation with an older woman  became the clear favorite of both the radio-listening audience and disc jockeys. Despite its length of 5:15 ("Reason to Believe" itself clocks in at just over four minutes), the song was fitted on a standard 7-inch single in its full edit (excepting for an early fade) ... and soon became a classic that is played heavily to this day.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneyM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneyM">Boney M</a> originally released "Brown Girl in the Ring" as the B-side to "Rivers of Babylon". Once "Rivers of Babylon" had become a hit and was slipping down the charts, they asked radio stations to start playing "Brown Girl in the Ring" instead  and then released that as the A-side of a single, with the B-side  what else?  "Rivers of Babylon". Effectively, many people ended up buying the same record again but upside down.
</li><li> The song "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" (by "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand">Steam</a>") was written for the purpose of being the inferior B-side song for a number of A-side songs. It became a hit, while most of the A-sides were forgotten.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce">Vanilla Ice</a>'s "Ice Ice Baby" was originally the B-side to his cover of Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music," which was also a top five hit but not as big as "Ice Ice Baby" and is today forgotten to the point where he is usually considered a one-hit wonder.
</li><li> "Move It" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CliffRichard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CliffRichard">Cliff Richard</a> and the Drifters and "Shakin' All Over" by Johnny Kidd and the Pirates (the first British rock record and rock number 1, respectively).
</li><li> "Beth", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a>' biggest pop hit, was originally the b-side to "Detroit Rock City." The latter is probably the better known song today, however.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>'s "S.O.S.", which was one of their first worldwide hits, first appeared as the B-side to the French issue of the less well remembered "Bang-A-Boomerang". France never did get "S.O.S." as a single in its own right, even after it became a hit elsewhere.
</li><li> "How Soon Is Now?" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a> was first released as a B-side to "William, It Was Really Nothing", then appeared on the compilation "Hatful Of Hollow" and the US version of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatIsMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatIsMurder">Meat Is Murder</a></em>, and only after that given a proper single release. This is commonly cited as the reason for its comparatively poor chart performance.
</li><li> Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" was originally the B-side to "Substitute."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis">Oasis</a>'s "Acquiesce" started out as the B-side to "Some Might Say". Such was its popularity with fans that it became a single itself a few years later (natch, it was as the lead-off single from <em>The Masterplan</em>, a collection of B-sides).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>'s "Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)" was originally the B-Side to Brain Stew/Jaded (itself a Double A-Side), but rerecorded for the following album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nimrod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nimrod">nimrod.</a></em>, and subsequently became one of their best known (if not <em>the</em> best known, period) songs. The song "Maria" on <em>International Superhits</em> was originally released in a different version as the B-Side to the 7" version of "Waiting", which meant it was widely regarded as a new song.
</li><li> Many songs by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> were originally released as B-sides, including such classics as "Rain", "I Am the Walrus", "Revolution", "Don't Let Me Down" and "The Inner Light". The album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PastMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PastMasters">Past Masters</a></em> compiles a lot of them.
</li><li> A really weird example is "Hey Hey What Can I Do?" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>. The band was no stranger to releasing singles, however, none of them were non-album songs. This one, released as the B-side of "Immigrant Song", was, and yet remains a beloved radio staple to many an American Zep fan (non-singles are usually not played on UK radio).
<ul><li> They originally recorded it to be a non-album single in the UK, but decided against it, so it was an obvious choice for interntational B Side. It was in the running for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinIII">Led Zeppelin III</a></em> at one point but not included.
</li></ul></li><li> "Incense And Peppermints" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStrawberryAlarmClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStrawberryAlarmClock">The Strawberry Alarm Clock</a>. "Birdman Of Alkatrash" was its original A-side, but radio DJs preferred the flip-side instead.
</li><li> An abridged version of "You Can't Always Get What You Want" was the B-side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' "Honky Tonk Women". When the full version was released on <em>Let It Bleed</em>, it became just as popular.
</li><li> "Dear God" is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XTC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XTC">XTC</a>'s most well-known songs - Originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a> from <em>Skylarking</em> due to the label's concerns about the album's length and potential controversy over its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionRantSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionRantSong">agnostic lyrical theme</a>, it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a> to the single "Grass". Despite the record label being especially concerned about the song getting negative reception in America, American DJs actually preferred playing it over "Grass". There <em>was</em> some controversy over the lyrics, and even a couple of violent incidents - a Florida radio station received a bomb threat for playing it, while a student in New York forced a faculty member to play the song over the school's PA at knife point... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">If anything, this just seemed to make the song more popular</a>, and "Dear God" was subsequently added to the US version of the album, with another song ("Mermaid Smiled") being cut for time instead.
</li><li> A near example came while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> was working on doing a B-side for a single off his new solo album. Visiting with his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>, who had a mini recording studio in his place, he ended up doing a little song along with a few other friends, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra">Jeff Lynne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomPetty">Tom Petty</a>, taking the name from a tag on one of Dylan's travel cases. When he sent it to the record company, they saw immediately that this was NOT B-side material song and asked for more. The result was that <em>Handle With Care</em> became the lead song from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTravelingWilburys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTravelingWilburys">The Traveling Wilburys</a>' first album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarefulWithThatAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarefulWithThatAxe">Careful with That Axe</a>, Eugene" was originally released as the B-side to the unpopular single "Point Me At The Sky", the latter of which even the band expresses dislike for. Nonetheless, CWTAE went on to become a live staple from 1968 to 1973, becoming increasingly longer and more elaborate, even seeing release on the live side of their fourth album, Ummagumma.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> &amp; The Attractions' cover version of Brinzley Shwarz's "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding", which came to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover up</a> the original. Not only was it originally a b-side, but it wasn't even a B-side to an Elvis Costello single - it first appeared as the B-side to "American Squirm", a single by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickLowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickLowe">Nick Lowe</a>, who wrote "...Peace Love And Understanding".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>'s "The Sweetest Thing" was originally a b-side to "Where the Streets Have No Name" in 1987. Eleven years later they re-recorded it for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">The Best of 1980-1990</a></em> and that version became a sizable hit.
<ul><li> U2 did it again with their B.B. King collaboration <em>When Love Comes To Town</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJoshuaTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJoshuaTree">The Joshua Tree</a></em>. While the A-side was certainly strong, many radio stations flipped it over and gave equal airtime to the B-Side, a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith">Patti Smith</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wave">Dancin' Barefoot</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a>'s "Colour My World" was a B-side twice; it backed "Make Me Smile" in 1970 and "Beginnings" in '71.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a> used "Home", a track off his debut album, as a b-side for <em>five</em> songs before he released it as a single off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits Album</a> in 1996. (He wanted to release it off the debut album, but backed down because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeDiffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeDiffie">Joe Diffie</a> had released another song of the same name.)
</li><li> "Kung Fu Fighting" by Carl Douglas was originally supposed to be a B-side to "I Want to Give You My Everything" (they had a three-hour recording session, and had to rush "Kung Fu Fighting" in the last ten minutes). The label decided to swap and make it an A-side. The novelty song kept him from ever being taken seriously again and led to him being a one-hit wonder.
</li><li> "Born Slippy .NUXX" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Underworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Underworld">Underworld</a> ("lager, lager, lager, mega-mega-white thing..."), famous for appearing in the final scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Trainspotting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Trainspotting">Trainspotting</a></em>, was originally a B-side to the very different track "Born Slippy" and was more or less thrown together as a joke.
</li><li> Feeder's "Just A Day" was originally the B Side to "Seven Days In The Sun", before it appeared on the Gran Turismo 3 soundtrack, from which it was released as a single in its own right. It ended up becoming a huge hit.
<ul><li> As with "Shatter", once the B Side to "Tumble And Fall", and then released on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits">Greatest Hits</a> album "The Singles" from which it was a single (albeit slightly remixed). The band really wanted this track on Pushing The Senses but the record company felt it was too heavy, so they were glad to have it on The Singles.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a> released their singles compilation <em>Substance</em> in 1987, they recorded the song "1963" to promote it, but when they came to produce a B-side for it, they came up with "True Faith", and "1963" got relegated to the flipside instead. However, "1963" was so popular with both critics and fans that when they put out their next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits">Greatest Hits</a> compilation a few years later, a remixed version finally got released as an A-side in its own right. The second disc of the CD version of <em>Substance</em> also collected the band's B-sides.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode">Depeche Mode</a> were famous for including exclusive B-Sides on almost all their singles, and their US label really liked their song "But Not Tonight" (the B-Side of Stripped) and flipped the tracks. The song was included on a movie soundtrack as well as the US version of the band's album "Black Celebration". The band were annoyed about this as they felt "Stripped" to be one of their best songs yet (something that many fans agree with), and felt that "But Not Tonight" was a rushed, thrown together pop song in comparison. "But Not Tonight" remains popular in the US, but "Stripped" is also widely known, largely in recent years thanks to the infamous version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s "Silver Springs" was left off of the <em>Rumours</em> album and became a B-side to "Go Your Own Way" (much to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks">Stevie Nicks</a>' chagrin). The song finally got its time to shine when the live version from <em>The Dance</em> became a single in 1997.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a>'s "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" became the greatest-selling single of all time since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BingCrosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BingCrosby">"White</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerryChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerryChristmas">Christmas"</a>, it was largely thanks to its B-side: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Princess Diana</a> tribute "Candle in the Wind 1997"; in America, it was "Candle" whose name usually appeared first during its reign atop the Hot 100.
<ul><li> Actually, "Something"/"Candle" was technically a double A-side, as both songs' names were prominently displayed on the cover; the <em>actual</em> B-side on this release was a third song called "You Can Make History Young Again", the title of which did not appear anywhere other than the liner notes and the disc itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s version of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs">Santa Claus is Coming to Town</a>" was a B-side to "My Hometown" (from the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA">Born In The USA</a></em> album).
</li><li> The first single for The Doobie Brothers' <em>What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits</em> was "Another Park, Another Sunday", with the album track "Black Water" as a b-side. "Another Park..." peaked at #32 on the billboard charts, which its writer Tom Johnston attributes to radio stations pulling the song from airplay due to taking the lyric "the radio just seems to bring me down" personally. Meanwhile, the b-side slowly started picking up enough regional airplay that the label decided to issue it as a single on its own, which became their first #1 Billboard hit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillHaleyAndHisComets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillHaleyAndHisComets">Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</a>' "Rock Around the Clock" was recorded in two takes at the end of a session which was mostly spent working on "Thirteen Women (and Only One Man in Town)". When both were released on a single in May 1954, "Thirteen Women" was the A-side; while that song made the Cashbox charts, it ended up being a commercial disappointment. "Rock Around the Clock" would have to wait until it appeared in the opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle">Blackboard Jungle</a></em> in 1955 (courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GlennFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GlennFord">Glenn Ford</a>'s son Peter's record collection) to become a hit.
</li><li> "Wipe Out" by The Surfaris was improvised and recorded in two takes within ten minutes because their producer reminded them they needed a B-side for "Surfer Joe". While "Surfer Joe" was a hit of its own (#62 in the <em>Billboard</em> chart), "Wipe Out" ended up being the more popular of the two sides, making the charts three times (in 1963 at #2, in 1966 at #16 and in 1970 at #110) and being well-known to this day.
</li><li> The Winstons' "Amen Brother", the B-side to "Color Him Father", became the source of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmenBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmenBreak">Amen Break</a>, the most overused sample in music history.
</li><li> Vicious Pink's "8:15 to Nowhere/Great Balls of Fire" was originally a B-side to their hit "Cccan't You See?". "8:15" later had its own single release with "The Spaceship is Over There" as the B-side.
</li><li> Danish synthpop duo Laid Back's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">only North American hit</a>, "White Horse", was the B-side to their 1983 single <em>Sunshine Reggae</em>, whose A-side was a hit in several European countries.
</li><li> Daniel Miller, as The Normal, only released one single, "TVOD" b/w "Warm Leatherette", both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilkSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilkSong">filk songs</a> based on J.G. Ballard's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Crash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Crash">Crash</a></em>. The B-side achieved international recognition, being covered by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GraceJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GraceJones">numerous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran">artists</a>, while the A-side is completely forgotten nowadays.
</li><li> Trance duo Rank 1's second single, "Black Snow", had the B-side "The Citrus Juicer", which ended up being chosen for their 2002 album <em>Symsonic</em>.
</li><li> "Sunrise (Here I Am)" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scooter">Scooter</a> side project Ratty is a vocal remix of "Sunrise (Ratty's Inferno)", the B-side to Scooter's "She's The Sun".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael">George Michael</a>'s "Fantasy" was originally a B-side to "Waiting for that Day" in the UK and "Freedom! '90" in the US. In 2017, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">shortly after his death</a>, it was rereleased as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCollaboration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCollaboration">Posthumous Collaboration</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chic">Chic</a>'s Nile Rodgers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a>-fronted R'n'B group Them had a big UK hit in 1964 with their cover of "Baby, Please Don't Go" but its Morrison-penned B-side "Gloria" became just as popular and enduring, perhaps even more so. It also became a single in its own right in the US and other places.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> had a minor UK hit in 1981 with the single "Computer Love". Then DJs started flipping it over and playing the B-side "The Model", a track from a previous album which had already been a flop single in 1978 and was just there to fill space. The single was subsequently re-promoted with the sleeve altered to list "The Model" first (although the disc itself still identified it as the B side) and the single went to number one early the following year.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yazoo">Yazoo</a>'s "Situation" was first released as a 2 1/2 minute B-side to the 7" single of "Only You", then as a 6-minute 12" single mixed by François Kevorkian, which was the version used for their <em>Upstairs at Eric's</em> album.
</li><li> Gloria Jones' "Tainted Love", famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a>, was originally the B-side to her 1965 single "My Bad Boy's Comin' Home".
