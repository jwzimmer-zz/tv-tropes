But sometimes a person takes this a bit too far. When somebody starts acting like second place is for losers, it doesn't matter if you've won a footrace with everyone on the planet and bested 6,999,999,998 people. All that matters is you didn't beat the one.
</p><p>Some real-life athletes feel that way quite deeply, coming so close and yet missing the mark. For example, one scientific study analyzed photographs of the facial expressions of many Olympians as they learned how they had placed. Gold of course was almost always ecstatic, and Bronze medalists were happy to have placed at all, but a Silver winner usually showed disappointment or dejection at coming in second best, unless it was their first time competing. This is especially true in tournament-style sports where the bronze team had won their game, but the silver medalists <em>lost</em> the game for gold. And then the presentation ceremony takes place immediately upon conclusion of the last match, giving the runners-up no time to compose themselves and put on a sporting face.

<ul><li> Nike famously misread their target market with their advertising campaign featuring Andre Agassi that ran during the 1996 Summer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympics</a> in Atlanta with the tagline "You don't win silver, you lose gold."

</li><li> An ad for NBC show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoOn">Go On</a></em> featured gymnast Shawn Johnson being brought to the support group and asked to talk about losing, having "lost" by getting three silver medals. Johnson herself is portrayed in the commercial as falling into this trope, insisting "I won" based only on her gold medal.

While the other members take it better, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> winning the second prize in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a> contest</span> is the catalyst that sends George into a life crisis, believing he can't connect with the public (and thus achieve success as a fashion designer) without compromising his personal artistic vision. Yukari also takes it rather dramatically. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Angst ensues, they break up.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: This is Seto Kaiba's outlook on life. He lost his <em>Duel Monsters</em> Champion title to Yugi and he didn't manage to defeat Yugi in a <em>fair</em> duel in the Duelist Kingdom. He creates the Battle City tournament to gather all Egyptian God Cards and to defeat Yugi in his tournament. However, Kaiba loses to Yugi in the semi-finals, so after the end of the Battle City, Kaiba blows up Alcatraz and the whole island to <em>kill</em> Yugi with his friends, but they escape. After Battle City, Kaiba loses his goal of becoming number one in favor of focusing on his Kaiba Land project, but defeating Yugi still remains a symbolic goal in his eye, proven by the way he blows his top in the DOMA Arc (anime only) when he finds out his rival has lost to Rafael.
</li><li> Kaiba's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> Jack Atlas gets hit with this <em>hard</em> in his duels with Yusei Fudo. When their first turbo duel gets interrupted by the Crimson Dragon crashing the final play, Jack sees a video recording of their cards and is shocked to learn that Yusei would've won the duel, sending him into a funk until he gets the chance for a rematch in the Fortune Cup. This duel ends with Yusei winning; once Jack loses his champion status, his fanbase almost completely disappears. On the plus side, this teaches Jack a hard lesson about the fickle nature of fame and the need to stick with one's true friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> takes this trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">the logical extreme</a>. Initially, when Shinji first surpasses Asuka's synch ratio, she's just pissed at him. Later, after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">curbstomped three times in a row with Shinji always scoring the kill instead of her</a>, she becomes extremely distraught, due to her past: she always prided herself on being the best so that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">won't need any kind of help from anyone</a>. By not being the best anymore and her rival consistently having a stellar performance, she's afraid of being put to the sidelines and as a result, her synch ratio is plummeting; seeing this, she also becomes afraid that if she drops low enough, she will be relieved of her duties which to her would be equal to being publicly humiliated in the worst way possible for a human. And the best part in all of this? <strong>She knows what's wrong but her pride doesn't let her admit it to herself.</strong> Oh, it gets even <em>better</em>. Right after her third defeat (technically second since she couldn't attack Leliel, much less harm it), she's sent into battle again, knowing that this is the last chance the NERV leadership is giving for her: if she screws up this time, it's game over. Not only she doesn't get a single shot off at Arael, <strong>she undergoes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> instead</strong>. And she gets saved by the person she hates the most. Next time she's sent up against Armisael, she can't even get her Eva to move anymore and is withdrawn; as an indirect result, Rei-II is killed by the Angel despite Shinji's intervention ("you didn't send him out for me... am I really that worthless?"). What do NERV does in this situation? Do they try to solve Asuka's psychological problems and cheer her up? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">Noooo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">they send her into early retirement and fetch a replacement instead</a> - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">who just so happens to be the final Angel</a></em>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>. It's made clear that many of the teams have players who are on their last chance to make it to the finals, and none of them are content with being 2nd.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a> Mashiro and Takagi are crushed to learn that they got third place with "The World is All About Money And Intelligence," (losing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Eiji</a> and someone else) even though it surpasses all their previous efforts, since it means they will not be able to submit it for serialization. Otherwise, this trope is largely averted with a few exceptions (mainly Iwase), as when the main characters are starting out and want to get up past ninth place, Miura tells them that rather than try desperate tactics to go up, they should maintain their ranking, as anything above 10th place will not come up for cancellation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Keith Goodman/Sky High</a></span> struggling with this after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barnaby Brooks Jr. takes his place as the highest ranking superhero</span>.

</li><li> Saber Tooth's guild master in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> believes this to the point that the guild model is effectively "To be the strongest". To drive the point home, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">he expels anyone who loses during the Grand Magic Games in the most humiliating way possible</a>.

Even when the n°1 is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> and almost had <em>the maximum score</em> minus 2 points. Yurine wishes nothing more than for Ayaka to best her though, and falls in love with her partly for this reason.

<ul><li> Goku got second place at the 21st and the 22nd Martial Arts Tournaments. He was specifically told by Master Roshi not to expect to win since he was still inexperienced. Goku didn't care and went for the win and was visibly upset that he lost. The second time, he lost to Tien after having the bad luck of running into a truck as he was falling and hitting the ground first (it's a long story). When Krillin tried to congratulate him Goku says, "A loss is a loss."

An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> of Scrooge, Flintheart is depicted as a miser, plutocrat, and tycoon, every negative quality associated with wealth, and despite having more money that most countries, is obsessed with surpassing his rival as the richest.

</li><li> Subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNewman">Kim Newman</a> short story "The Germans Won", in which an alternative version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor">John Major</a> lives life as a humble bus conductor.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0keui');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0keui" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0keui');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The real John Major actually applied for a job as a bus conductor, but failed the exam, and went into politics instead.</span> During an argument about the World Cup, one of the characters brings up this trope in relation to Britain and how they always come second at everything and how that makes them losers. The normally shy Major finds himself moved to argue this point with surprising passion:
<div class="indent"> "You're wrong, Jeffrey. There's nothing wrong with losing in a final. Being Second Best In The World means something. There's nothing wrong with being top of League Division Two. There's nothing wrong with being honestly Second-rate." <br/>"Show me a good loser, John, and I'll show you a loser." <br/>"Results don't matter, Jeffrey," said John. "Playing the game does. Life isn't results. When you die, they don't calculate your goal average and judge whether you should be promoted or relegated. Life is the game, the process of the game, moment to moment. If you do your best, no one can blame you. If you play fair, no one can argue with you. Better a successful dustbinman than a wash-out field marshall."
</div></li><li> Subverted in <em>Bill's New Frock</em> by Anne Fine. During a race in gym class, all the other kids agree that they will let a disabled boy win, but because of this trope Bill can't bear to come second and so he speeds up and wins. However, the disabled boy is <em>thrilled</em> with second place because it's the best performance he has ever made in the class.
</li><li> "No Second Place Winner" by Bill Jordan, a Border Patrolman and Marine during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The book covers that in gunfights, very often there is no second place, you win or die. The idea for the title comes from a man getting second place at a gun tournament, then being told that, in essence, "At least you got second". The response was, "I wouldn't wish second place on my worst enemy."

Its sequel, <em>The Shadow Club Rising</em>, has the kids suspected of doing it again to a new, popular boy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a>: Balance of Power</em>, an auction is selling off a well-known inventor's works to the highest bidder. The coveted lot is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, with the Federation, Klingon, Romulan, and Cardassian governments all bidding on it. The auctioneer invokes a rule that requires the second highest bid to pay up as well, without getting anything in return. This works to drive up the price of the item. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Picard (representing the Federation) and Worf (representing the Klingons) agree to pool their latinum into a single high bid to overcome the Cardassian bid, resulting in the Cardassian representative being forced to fork over a <em>lot</em> of latinum for nothing. But then the photon pulse cannon turns out to be a dud. Luckily, they come up with a way to screw over the Cardassians yet again by having a Ferengi "steal" the plans for the cannon and sell it to the same Cardassian representative.</span>

The subversion comes in that while stating that he'll come in first in nearly everything, he freely admits that he'll gladly accept a bronze medal in boxing, having been knocked out by a three-year-old during practice.

After <em>Samoa</em>, he acted like he was slapped in the face and practically <em>murdered</em> when he came in second out of <em>twenty</em> people, then third out of <em>twenty people</em>, all of which were former players and several of which were considered the <em>best</em>. however when he won the Sprint player of the year award, he <em>immediately</em> begun the typical Victory dance in <em>Heroes vs. Villains</em>.
</li><li> Russell basically acted like a terrible sport in Heroes vs. Villains. Instead of congratulating Sandra in not angering potential votes, Russell began to attack the game <em>itself</em> saying that it was "Flawed" if someone who played differently than him could <em>win</em>, and immediately proposing an alternative rule(set) that would most <em>definitely</em> favour <em>him</em>. Basically, he came across as someone who played the game well and deserved more recognition from the fellow players...or a <em>terrible</em> sport who needs to learn that the game is <em>not</em> just played his way.

It begins with Jason facing Tommy, a new kid in town, in a martial arts contest which ultimately ends in a tie. As Jason returns to his friends, the first words that come out of his mouth are "I didn't win." Granted, he doesn't dwell on it anymore after this one moment, but it's still an odd thing for a character like Jason to be concerned about.

<ul><li> Even before the reveal, its lampshaded that a preganglionic fiber and a postganglionic nerve are nothing alike and a student of his caliber couldn't have mistaken them, suggesting some motive or psychology for throwing the test.

It doesn't matter how highly they did place, or that competition is not the focus of show choir; if they don't place at the very top, they might as well be at the bottom.
</li><li> Normally averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a></em>, where simply appearing on the show is enough to grant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen">Drag Queen</a> superstar status in the gay community and nightclub circuit. However, Season 4 runner-up Chad Michaels did little to hide her disappointment at losing to Sharon Needles. When Chad reappeared on <em>All Stars</em>, she joked that Sharon was "borrowing" her crown and the other queens commented that she seemed to be still sore about losing. She would go on to win the <em>All Stars</em> season, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">Conspiracy Theory</a> is that RuPaul only conceived of it in the first place as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">Consolation Prize</a> for Chad.
<ul><li> Season 5 runner-up Alaska Thunderfuck had a very similar attitude about losing the crown to Jinkx Monsoon. When she went on to win <em>All Stars 2</em>, it was considered by fans to be just as much of a consolation prize as <em>All Stars 1</em> was for Chad. Queens in later seasons have been much more gracious about their placement, for the most part.
</li></ul></li><li> This is Archer's attitude in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, where he's is remembering humanity's first Warp 3 flight. Archer is upset to be passed over for the test flight. When a bartender points out that he'll probably fly the next one, Archer asks her if she knows what Buzz Aldrin said after stepping on the Moon. She doesn't. Archer says that no one does, because Neil Armstrong was first. His attitude changes later, though. In fact, he ends up captaining Starfleet's first Warp 5-capable ship.

<ul><li> American gymnast McKayla Maroney has been gracious in her public comments, saying that she is grateful and appreciative of her silver medal in the vault despite being an overwhelming favourite for gold. Still, her face is the picture for this trope, and it could sour fresh cream, as well as having launched a meme (which, to her credit, she's had fun with)  and, given that she <em>would</em> have won if she'd not sat down her second vault, it's difficult to blame her for kicking herself.
<ul><li> When the US Women's gymnastics team made history at the 1996 Atlanta Games by winning the first team gold, the Russian and Romanian teams (the silver and bronze medal, respectively) were shown to be in tears, clearly feeling this way.
</li><li> In another case in gymnastics, two Russian gymnasts won silver and bronze in the 2012 women's all-around final. Silver medalist Viktoria Komova was in tears after losing to American Gabby Douglas. On the other hand, bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina was quite happy after winning a tie-break against American Aly Raisman.
</li><li> In the 2018 World Championships, the Russian men's team lost to China by less than half a tenth of a point and they took it quite badly. Artur Dalaloyan in particular spent a long time crying and unable to stand up. The situation reversed the following year, when Russia won over China and Sun Wei had the same exact reaction.
</li><li> Going back to an earlier era, Czechoslovak gymnast Věra Čáslavská was very unhappy about her silver-medal finish in the balance beam final and gold-medal tie in the floor final at the 1968 Olympics, despite winning gold in the other three individual finals, and made no efforts to hide it. In her case, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">understandable</a>: both of those finishes were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackDefeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackDefeat">highly questionable</a> (the floor final especially, where a gymnast's score from an earlier round was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retroactively boosted</a></em> to the exact number needed to put her in a tie with Čáslavská), and both decisions were to the benefit of Soviet gymnasts, a country which Čáslavská had a personal hatred for as they had recently invaded her homeland.

See below for some egregious examples...
<ul><li> The Buffalo Bills made it to the Super Bowl four straight years, only to lose all four times. Instead of being thought of as a team that dominated the AFC by winning it four straight times<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u6ao');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u6ao" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u6ao');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Granted, this was during a period of time when most of the league's dominant teams were in the NFC (The Bills appearances being right dab in the middle of the NFC's <em>13</em> Super Bowl win streak).</span>, they're thought of as chokers, and spawned the initialism <strong>B</strong>oy, <strong>I</strong> <strong>L</strong>ove <strong>L</strong>osing <strong>S</strong>uper Bowls.
</li><li> The 2004 Philadelphia Eagles had one of the best seasons in the history of the franchise. They won 13 games in the regular season (a team record at the time), and had finally managed to win the NFC title game after losing it in the three consecutive years prior. Still, the most indelible memory of that magical season was team's horrible mismanagement of the clock and quarterback Donovan McNabb's apparent fatigue in Super Bowl XXXIX.
</li><li> The 2007 New England Patriots were undefeated in regular season play and were expected to win the championship. Analysts were calling them the greatest team of all time. Then they lost to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII and suddenly an 181 season just wasn't good enough to be the best.
</li><li> The 2013 Denver Broncos arguably had the most prolific offense of all time, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing an NFL-record 55 touchdown passes. They won 13 games, secured home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, and beat Tom Brady and the Patriots in the AFC title game. The season is mostly remembered for a different kind of history, however. The Seattle Seahawks drubbed the Broncos 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII, one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history.
</li><li> The 2015 Carolina Panthers were one of only seven NFL teams in history to win 15 games in a regular season. Little is remembered about that season today except for a sullen press conference by quarterback Cam Newton following a 24-10 loss to the Broncos in Super Bowl 50.
</li><li> To say nothing of the 2016 Atlanta Falcons, who had their best season since their last Super Bowl appearance 18 years ago and made it to Super Bowl LI against the Patriots, where they squandered a <em>25-point lead</em> and the Patriots forced overtime for the first time in the history of the big game, and it wasn't long before that lead was entirely for naught.
</li><li> The 2018 Los Angeles Rams were led by Sean McVay, who at 33 years old was the league's youngest head coach, and his team put up a whopping 527 points in the regular season, and an extra 56 points between their two playoff games against the Dallas Cowboys and New Orleans Saints. That made him the youngest coach to reach the Super Bowl, the team's first in 17 years, facing the team that defeated them last time at Super Bowl XXXVI, the Patriots. Despite sloppy play by both teams, the Patriots once again defeated them 13-3 at Super Bowl LIII, tying the lowest losing score with the Miami Dolphins at Super Bowl VI. It didn't help that during the NFC Championship Game against the Saints, the Rams were guilty of an overlooked pass-interference call, which made many people, especially Saints fans, feel that they didn't deserve to play in the Super Bowl.
</li></ul></li><li> One of Liverpool FC's most famous and successful managers, Bill Shankly, who founded the 'Boot Room', a managing dynasty that led to Liverpool dominating the English game for the best part of twenty years after he left the club, once said, "If you are first, you are first. If you are second, you are nothing."
<ul><li> Ironically, Liverpool have not been champions of English football since the 1989-90 season, even before the Premier League era, and they're the highest profiled of the Big Six of English football that have never won it (the other being Spurs). In the mean time, they've been surpassed by Manchester United in the most titles won race due to the efforts of Sir Alex Ferguson, and have come close to winning it in the 2013-14 and 2018-19 seasons, but having won 10 domestic cup titles and 5 European competition including 2 Champions Leagues and 1 UEFA Cup.

In the event they put out a respectable performance.
</li><li> A quarter of a century later, the Croatian Soccer team lost the 2018 World Cup final to France. While the team did look disappointed during the presentation ceremony itself, that soon evaporated. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.balls.ie/football/lose-world-cup-final-392896">The Croatian capital had scenes of celebration.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. After all, gritty, hard fighting underdog representing a small nation of 4 million don't usually reach a World Cup Final.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LebronJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LebronJames">Lebron James</a> is a straight example. Because of the constant expectation and pressure to be the best of his generation, and the critics comparing him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan">Michael Jordan</a>, Kobe Bryant, just to name a few, he is very disappointed when he comes up short in the basketball season, despite reaching the Finals for majority of his career, and winning 3 of them.
</li><li> The 1972 United States Olympic basketball team still has not accepted their silver medals, as they contend the officials in the gold-medal game against the Soviet Union robbed them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2k3tn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2k3tn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2k3tn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the appeal the US filed with FIBA was also denied  though the five-man jury's chairman, Ferenc Hepp, refused to reveal the exact vote, between Hepp (Hungary) stating he voted in favor of the Soviets, Rafael Lopez (Puerto Rico) and Claudio Coccia (Italy) both saying they voted for the US, and the other two (Adam Baglaewski, Poland; Andres Keiser, Cuba) being from Soviet-friendly countries, it's accepted as fact that the vote was along Cold War lines</span>; the medals remain in a Swiss vault. They don't intend to do so any time soon: one player has even written into his will that his relatives and descendants are <em>forbidden</em> from accepting the medal on his behalf when he dies. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yjl5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yjl5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yjl5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Whether it was a bad call or not is subjective, depending on the point of view; with three seconds remaining, the Soviet team attempted to call a time-out; because it was during a free throw with the clock running, and such a time out is is not permitted, it was not granted. But then a second referee recognized the time out, because the Soviet coach ran onto the field, committing another foul. <em>Then</em> because of this, William Jones, head of the International Amateur Basketball Federation, told the scoreboard officials to set it to three seconds even though he had <em>absolutely no authority whatsoever to do so</em>, which he later openly admitted. Nonetheless, the time was restarted, and as a result, the Soviet team won 5150.</span>
</li><li> A great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> is the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Men's 100m sprint in track and field, which was dominated by Usain Bolt (who got a world record at 9.69s effortlessly). But the silver medalist, Walter Dix of Trinidad and Tobago, acted like <em>he</em> won the gold after edging American bronze medalist Rudy Gay. Even Gay didn't look very heartbroken.
</li><li> Nancy Kerrigan clearly had this feeling after winning the silver medal at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, given her snarky to the point of cruelty comment regarding gold medalist Oksana Baiul's uncontrollable weeping as well as the clearly displeased expression that she wore throughout. It's slightly understandable given that (a) she lost the gold by a ridiculously slim margin (a mere tenth of a point gave Baiul the gold), (b) skated what is unanimously believed to be her best performance yet, and (c) a myriad of problems had to be overcome  succumbing to nerves, a polemic attack and subsequent physical injury, tremendous pressure to win. Still, petty and needless as Hell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">and the skating fandom hasn't forgotten it</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, although Japan's Midori Ito probably did not behave this way herself  she won silver at the 1992 Albertville Games after a disastrous week that left many wondering if she would win a medal at all  she knew her fellow countrymen would, especially since she had come into the games as the favorite. As such, she made a public apology for not winning the gold medal.
</li><li> After being edged out by Yuka Sato in the 1994 World Championships, French skater Surya Bonaly initially refused to come out for the medal ceremony, then refused to get onto the platform, then yanked off her silver medal, feeling that Sato, who was Japanese, had won solely because the competition was being held in Japan.
</li><li> Despite a magnificent career that concluded with her being the most decorated figure skater in US history—12 US Championship medals, nine of them gold, 9 World Championship medals, five of them gold, and two Olympic medals, a feat achieved by very few skaters, Michelle Kwan is remembered for the fact that she never won an Olympic gold medal, thanks to the uncharacteristically mediocre performances she turned in at both of her Olympic ventures in 1998 and 2002, where she'd been the projected favorite.
</li></ul></li><li> Hilariously, after failing to defend his title and finishing second in the men's individual figure skating at the Vancouver Olympics, Evgeni Plushenko initially displayed a <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/22/evgeni-plushenkos-platinu_n_472590.html">platinum medal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> on the splash page of his website, instead of the silver he won. When the media picked up on this, the page was quickly edited to show the silver medal.
</li><li> There was significant media controversy in Australia during the London Olympics centered around this attitude being incredibly prevalent towards the Australian swimming team, to the point where conflict around the long-standing tendency for this trope to be employed towards the team overshadowed the Olympics themselves for the first several days of competition, particularly Emily Seebohm all but bursting into tears in an interview after placing second in 100m backstroke because she thought she'd disappointed everyone, which many thought exposed just how much pressure the sporting culture places on athletes and how much backlash they really do have to fear if they take home anything other than gold. Todd Sampson summed it up on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGruenTransfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGruenTransfer">The Gruen Transfer</a></em>: "We like to think we're a sport-mad nation. The truth is, we're a winning-mad nation."
</li><li> Chinese athletes at the Olympics are typically under such overwhelming pressure from their home nation to win gold that anything less than first place is a massive disappointment for them. One example of this is Qiu Bo being caught crying on camera after David Boudia unexpectedly beat him for gold in men's 10m platform diving at the 2012 London Olympics, in stark contrast to Great Britain's Tom Daley who was so ecstatic to win bronze that he did a victory dive into the pool.
</li><li> Canadian swimmer Elaine Tanner came into Mexico City 1968 as a heavy favorite, and returned home with 3 medals, 60% of the country's tally that edition. But given none were gold, she was deemed a disappointment, nobody received her back home, and led to depression and retirement at just 18 - and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/13/elaine-tanner-olympic-heartbreak">one hell of a<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> life, where she even considered suicide before meeting her current husband. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/no-shame-in-silver-medal-tanner-tells-team-canada/article11181503/">Tanner later said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to be relieved to see Canada celebrating silver medals in later Olympics, but cringed at seeing Nike promoting Atlanta 1996 with billboards saying: You dont win silver  you lose gold.
</li><li> The Canadian Women's Hockey team was in tears with their heads hung low after losing to the United States in the gold medal game of the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympics, ending their 4-gold streak. When the medals were hung around the players' necks, one of the Canadian players took off her silver medal right away.
</li><li> The Brooklyn Dodgers were called "Dem Bums" in part because they would repeatedly win a league pennant before losing the World Series after, mostly against the Yankees. The Dodgers would finally win the World Series in 1955 before losing again in 1956 and moving to Los Angeles a few years later.
</li><li> Similar to the Yankees, if a Canadian national hockey team doesn't win a tournament they're playing in, it's deemed a failure. If enough of the various tournaments (IIHF Junior, Men's/Women's Olympic, World Cup) are lost in a row, a national discussion on whether we're "losing our game" ensues. The fact that on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">NHL</a> side of things the last Canadian team to win the Cup was the Montreal Canadiens in 1993 doesn't help; the national teams are suppose to bring redemption for the Canada's "NHL failures". Doesn't mean the wins aren't <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuJH2WXJGHI">appreciated.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The irony of this situation is that even now, when players come from all over the world to play hockey in the NHL, the league is still slightly over 50% Canadian. In short, even when American teams win in the NHL, Canada still technically wins because as often as not, more than half of the players on the winning team are Canadian.
</li><li> Dale Earnhardt was often quoted saying "Second place is just the first loser".
<ul><li> A slogan which appears on various T-shirts, and may have been adapted for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TalladegaNightsTheBalladOfRickyBobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TalladegaNightsTheBalladOfRickyBobby">Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</a></em>.
</li><li> A popular saying among NASCAR fans is that "No one remembers who finished second in the Daytona 500". Which is ironic given that one of things Earnhardt is remembered for is finishing second in the Daytona 500 over and over and over...
</li><li> Cale Yarborough had said "If he crowded me on the track it would be ok but when they ran us down we lost it". Basically the racing driver's way of saying "I don't like being shoved out and crashing but I really hate being outrun and finishing second".
</li></ul></li><li> For three seasons (2011, 2012, and 2013) NASCAR season, driver Martin Truex Jr. finished more closest to first than every other driver in NASCAR by coming in <em>second</em> in race after race after race after race. Rather than this consistent performance being rightly seen as a mark of a highly skilled driver, pretty much all of NASCAR (including Truex <em>and</em> his fans) consider him "underperforming".
</li><li> UCLA Bruins football coach Red Sanders and, more famously, Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, are both known for saying that <em>"Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing."</em>
</li><li> The Bayer Leverkusen squad which finished second in in all three of the Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League and the domestic German cup in the same season was nicknamed "Neverkusen" by the media, even though it was probably the best season in the whole history of the team.
</li><li> One of tennis star Serena Williams' more famous quotes; "At the end of the day, if you aren't first, you're last."
</li><li> The 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indianapolis 500</a> was Carlos Munoz's first ever and his first time in an Indycar race (Indy Lights notwithstanding), yet he managed to finish second behind Tony Kanaan. Most people would have been thrilled with this result, but he was disappointed with himself for not winning.
</li><li> When Denmark lost the final of the 2011 handball world championships, the Danish star player Mikkel Hansen quickly took off his silver medal. The story goes that he tossed it into Øresund<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4r36b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4r36b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4r36b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the world Championships in 2011 took place in Sweden, and Denmark played almost every game in Malmö, which is linked to Copenhagen by bridge</span>. He also took it off after the lost final in 2013, and put it under his tracksuit after the loss at the european championships in 2014. Hansen does not like silver medals.
</li><li> The almost eternal "curse" of the Chilean soccer club <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Deportivo_Universidad_Catolica">Universidad Católica<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which finished <strong>fourty-four</strong> times as second place in diverse Chilean championships until they finally won in April 2016. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>:
<div class="indent">"Since 2012, the club has always been in the fight for the championship, however, by one reason or the other, it has been unable to finish first, thus becoming the target of jokes by its rivals and adopting a reputation of a "2nd place team". The lack of titles and frustrating important match losses against bitter rivals and smaller clubs, has infuriated a demanding fan base that is now looking for changes at the top level. The hard core fans have been expressing their anger at the games by blaming the club's executives for keeping the club between the elite, not opening up the club to the masses, lack of investment in acquisition of players and poor decisions in the acquisition of a few foreign players that were not up to the club's standards."
</div></li><li> The most famed curse in football/soccer belongs to the Portuguese side S.L. Benfica. After considerable success in European competitions in the 1960's, coach Bela Guttmann quit the club after an argument with the club's board of directors over his wages. He proceeded to say that Benfica would not be European champions in 100 years, in what became known as "The Curse of Bela Guttmann". Ever since then, Benfica have reached five European Championship finals (1963, 1965, 1968, 1988 and 1990) and three UEFA Cup/Europa League finals (1983, 2013, 2014), losing them all. We're barely past half a century into the curse, approaching 60 years now while Benfica still waits.
</li><li> The famed Italian side Juventus F.C. has lost the European Championship/UEFA Champions League a record seven times, the most ever, while winning it twice. They've lost five finals (199697, 199798, 200203, 201415, 201617) ever since their last win in 1995-96. While there is merit in those accomplishments (as their fans argue), they are far behind AC Milan and behind Inter Milan in European competitions, the latter two's fans arguing that Juventus' second places mean considerably less than Juventus' fans would like to think.
</li><li> Mexican side Cruz Azul won their last LigaMX championship in 1997, and never again. They have reached the finals six times ever since then (1999, 2008-I, 2008-II, 2009-I, 2013-II, 2018-I), losing them all. What makes it more aggravating is that in most of those tournaments (and in 2011-I, where they didn't reach the final) they <strong>completely</strong> dominated the table and showed the makings of champions, only to lose them miserably in the final. A verb ("Cruzazulear" or <em>to-Cruz-Azul</em>) has been coloquially coined by Mexican fans to describe domineering teams that lose at the very last minute.
</li><li> Colombian side America de Cali entered professionalism in 1948, a decision that didn't sit well with ex-player and director Benjamin "Garabato" Urrea ("garabato" meaning "doodle" or "stick figure" due to his thinness and height). He thus proclaimed that the team might become professional, but that they'd never win the Colombian league. Thus began a 31-year drought where America couldn't win anything until 1979. Though "The Curse of Garabato" appeared to be lifted once and for all, it's considered that it was prolonged and plagued America in the Copa Libertadores stage, where they've become the South American side that has lost the most Copa Libertadores finals with 4 (losing once with Argentinos Juniors and Peñarol, and twice with River Plate).
<ul><li> The famed and historied America striker Antony "El Pitufo" De Avila ("Pitufo" meaning "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs">Smurf</a>" due to his small size) lost all those continental finals with America, plus another one while playing for Ecuador's Barcelona de Guayaquil, becoming the player who has lost the most Copa Libertadores finals with 5 to his name.
</li></ul></li><li> Colombian side Atlético Nacional, though being successful in Copa Libertadores (having won twice), has reached the finals of the Copa Sudamericana three times, losing two (to Argentina's San Lorenzo (2002) and River Plate (2014)), and ceding the dispute of the 2016 title to Brazil's Chapecoense due to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMia_Flight_2933">a plane crash that killed most of the Brazilian team<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while en-route to Colombia to play the first leg of the finals. The gesture was greatly received, and earned the Colombian team CONMEBOL's Centennial Fair Play Award, and a well deserved place in the history of the competition. The gesture was made further special due to the fact that Atletico Nacional was the last ever South American team to have had the opportunity of winning a continental treble of Libertadores/Sudamericana/Recopa in 2016 had they won against Chapecoense (as they had won the Copa Libertadores earlier in the year, and won the Recopa later against the same rivals), and could have played for an intercontinental flush in the FIFA Club World Cup that would take place some weeks after the Sudamericana finals. At the Club World Cup, the Colombians were defeated 0-3 by Japan's Kashima Antlers, and reached the 3rd place after defeating America de Mexico on penalties. <strong>No South American side ever won the Libertadores/Sudamericana/Recopa treble</strong>, and due to the fact that the scheduling format for the South American competitions was changed in 2017 (as Sudamericana and Libertadores did not use to overlap), the possibility of any other team winning a continental treble became impossible because the tournaments became simultaneous.
</li><li> The Argentina National Football Team is considered one of the most important national teams in the world and a powerhouse of South American football ever since its inception. However, the last international championship they've won has been the 1993 Copa América. Ever since then, they've reached four Copa América finals (2004, 2007, 2015, 2016) and a FIFA World Cup final (2014) and lost them all while boasting some of the highest-profiled, highest-paid and most celebrated players in the world in their ranks ever since the 90's. Though there have been call-outs about the players' lack of commitment to the national colors, it's largely blamed on AFA's mismanagement of the team and lacklustre oversight over benefits and logistics.
</li><li> Utterly subverted by Yael Arad, who won the silver at women's judo in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. She was hailed as a national hero in Israel for the simple fact that she was the first Israeli athlete to ever win <em>any</em> Olympic medal, and so was touted as a champion despite coming in second. What made things even funnier was that her last name literally means 'bronze' in Hebrew, so the joke was that she actually exceeded expectations by one medal.
</li><li> Hockey player Alexandre Daigle, after being picked first overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, said "I'm glad I got drafted first, because no one remembers number two". And then heapfuls of irony kicked in, as Daigle was an underachiever who was out of the league by the age of 25 (he came out of retirement 2 years later, but only had some success playing in Switzerland!), while the second pick, Chris Pronger, was a dominating defenseman who won a Stanley Cup, two Olympic golds and an MVP award.

The fourth and third-place prizes are a PP Up and a PP Max, respectively—useful items and difficult to find anywhere else. First place, as usual, is the coveted Master Ball. Second place, though, is a Rare Candy. In older games, this would have been a decent reward, but the newly-added Max Raids bombard you with so many XP Candies that the classic Rare Candy is practically worthless, other than as a moderately uncommon collectible.

Heck, because she lost honorably instead of taking a bribe to take a dive, they fashion a sign that says: "2 good 2 be #1."
</li><li> Parodied in "Deep Space Homer." One of the astronauts coming along on the mission is Buzz Aldrin, who insists that "second comes right after first," leading to awkward glances between the other characters.

Tino got 3rd place in a horseshoes competition, during a weekend sports meet, which he was pretty proud of, considering he took up the sport that weekend.

Even then, they're just barely in second place. Despite this they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">absolutely hate being second</a> and are frequently trying to dethrone Jem's band (usually by violence or other improper means). When it comes to their lead singer Pizzazz, this is related to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>. Her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">abandoned her</a> and her father when she was young and her father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">was very distant</a> and preferred to throw presents at her rather than spend time with her. She came to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">crave attention</a> and uses her fans as a substitute for it. Pizzazz wants to be the number one band and won't take second place. In one episode The Misfits lost a contest with the Holograms where the objective was to sell more records, losing by <em>one sale</em>. Stormer even reminded her two friends that they had managed to sell a million albums (the equivalent of a platinum) but Pizzazz was <em>still</em> furious.

<div class="indent"><strong>Applejack:</strong> Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue.

</li><li> Outright subverted during the running of the leaves. Twilight is extremely proud of herself for coming in 5th place, which is highly respectable considering it's her first race ever. Even the competitive Applejack and Rainbow Dash don't berate her for it; they're too busy moping about tying... for dead last.
</li><li> Rarity was traumatized as a filly when the go-kart she designed for the Applewood Derby got second place for creative design, though the fact that she lost to Derpy's go-kart which looked like a bunch of planks nailed together probably didn't help. Years later as an adult mare the memory of her loss <em>still</em> drives her to bitter tears.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>American Dad</em> shows Stan Smith as a living embodiment of the trope. Stan believes that when it comes to sports, you either win or you're just a pathetic loser. The episode "Every Which Way But Lose" has Stan constantly belittling his son, Steve, for not coming in 1st place in any sport. When Steve teams up with Roger and beats Stan's team in a football game, Stan takes the loss so badly that he almost commits suicide, believing he would rather die than to live life with a loss on his record.
</li><li> Also played with in an episode where Stan goes with Francine to her high school reunion, happy that he's married to the homecoming queen. Francine points out that she only won by one vote, and the runner-up had gone on to be fat, unattractive, and miserable since (she left the prom to eat at a Dunkin Donuts). But when the ballot box is shown, two uncounted votes for the runner-up are discovered. Francine happily gives her tiara to her, while Stan is unhappy to learn that he didn't marry the homecoming queen after all.
</li><li> The mother of Steve's Japanese friend Toshi, and his on-off-again romantic interest Akiko believes in this trope wholeheartedly, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerMom">Tiger Mom</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mama</a> who relentlessly pressures her daughter to study and work on countless competitions. When Steve beats Akiko in a spelling bee, Steve ends up forfeiting the win to her when he sees her mother openly berate her and promising to be even stricter from now on. Strangely, this ONLY applies to Akiko, as the mother is never seen doing much parenting with Toshi.

Her reaction? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She lost it and vowed to take Uncle Grandpa's job, taking on the alter ego "Aunt Grandma".</span>

<ul><li> To add insult to injury, in the country's earliest elections (prior to a change in the election system), the prize for coming in second was getting the oh-so-glamorous position of... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho">Vice-President!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Buzz Aldrin was described by Michael Collins as letting his disappointment at not being <em>first</em> on the moon, to cause him not to appreciate being second. However, many people <em>do</em> remember him as being the man who was <em>almost</em> the first to walk on the moon (among other things, such as punching a guy who claimed he didn't go to the moon; Aldrin certainly cashed in on Neil Armstrong becoming reclusive to escape being just a footnote), while the other 10 men on that ship generally feel lucky to have been on the moon at all.
</li><li> A common saying regarding not winning is "close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades". The former, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoes#Scoring">because you win points for almost hitting the post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the latter because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage">the shrapnel ensures damage even without a direct hit</a>.
