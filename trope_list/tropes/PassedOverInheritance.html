<div class="indent">— <strong>Heather</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama Action</a></em>
</div></div><p>The wealthy baroness Alice B. Tropenhiezner has passed away recently. Now all of her family and friends have gathered for the reading of the will.
</p><p>All of her children are in attendance, each expecting a large share of their dear old mother's grand fortune. But as the will is read by their executor or via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoWill">Video Will</a>, it turns out that all the children are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor">Inadequate Inheritors</a>. She will proceed to demean them all and list all their faults. She may, however, leave each child with some sort of gift, such as leaving her son Bob the collection of photo albums, and her daughter Carol all the fine silverware, and her youngest son Dwayne with a ball of yarn she's treasured for years. Or she may decide to leave them all nothing at all.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Instead, Alice decides to leave her entire fortune and estate to somebody completely unexpected. It could be a good friend from her college years, or a servant she's trusted for years, or an unknown relative who's been living in poverty for so many years. It could be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> child, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">married a woman other than the one she chose</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">supported himself and his family since.</a> It could even be a complete stranger that she only met once but feels deserves the money more than her own children. Sometimes the unexpected heirs are bastard children and paramours; or it could be that Bob, Carol, and Dwayne are suffering because they don't have perfect qualifications as the legitimate children of the family estate. It could be incredibly degrading for the children if Alice leaves her entire fortune to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetHeir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetHeir">pets</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The rotten children, after hearing the contents of the will, are of course very shocked and very angry for not getting nearly what they expected — <em>especially</em> if Alice was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>, and did not get it from her family. Expect a lot of screaming and whining. Also expect these children to become the plot's main villains, for these rotten people still believe that the money is rightfully theirs and are willing to do anything to get it back. They may plan to kill the unrightful heirs in order for the money to trickle back down to them. They may try to steal the money some other way, such as breaking into the estate and leaving with what they can like mere burglars. The more clever ones will devise a clever scheme to trick the heir into giving up his money. In more realistic works, it'll usually result in a lengthy court battle that will probably ruin family relations for a very long time, if not permanently, as said battle will often involve everyone involved sinking to their absolute lowest to get or keep what they view as their fair share.

This is regarded as particularly vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">if Alice had inherited it herself</a>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a> can reasonably expect the children to go out and repeat his work. Then there are the cases where Alice raised her children as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">Idle Rich</a> and now despises them for it.
</p><p>She may lay down who the heir will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition">On One Condition</a>, which often leads to the characters, or the better ones among them, organizing their own split at the end.
</p><p>Or Alice was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> between the normal heirs and the named one.
</p><p>Everybody who gains an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance">Unexpected Inheritance</a> from some aunt they hardly knew are bound to come across these people. These vengeful brats are not only used to serve as the antagonist of the honest and lucky unexpected heir but to also serve as their foil. This plot device is often used to demonstrate that good and honest people always get the best rewards and the greedy and rotten people are always left out in the cold.
</p><p>See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor">Inadequate Inheritors</a> who may fall victim to this trope if they don't correct their faults. Also note that completely disinheriting direct children can be illegal in some countries, such as in France. Laws guaranteeing surviving spouses a significant share of estates are common in the U.S.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBellairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBellairs">John Bellairs</a> did this in two of his series:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseWithAClockInItsWalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseWithAClockInItsWalls">The House With a Clock in Its Walls</a></em>, the first book established that Jonathan inherited his money from his grandfather, with the implications that his own father and siblings were this trope; two of Strickland's books go into more depth on it:
<ul><li> Book 10, <em>The Whistle, The Grave and The Ghost</em> reveals that Lewis's father Charles was a hard-working man who made a good living by himself (and thus didn't <em>need</em> the money), while Charles and Jonathan's sisters Helen and Mattie lost out because they were bossy, nosy and had married outside their religion (the rest of the family was Catholic, but they married Baptists). Jonathan, on the other hand, inherited everything because he was like his grandfather: "fat, lazy and too easygoing to worry about making money". (Also, he'd gone to agricultural college with the intention of becoming a farmer; Great-Grandpa Barnavelt approved of this since he'd started out as a farmer and homesteader himself before joining the army during the American Civil War and later building up a fortune in the railroad and livestock industries.)
</li><li> Book 12, <em>The Sign of the Sinister Sorcerer</em> reveals that Jonathan's father was also passed over because he and Great-Grandpa Barnavelt had had some kind of falling-out at one point.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTreasureOfAlpheusWinterborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTreasureOfAlpheusWinterborn">The Treasure of Alpheus Winterborn</a></em>, the first book of the <em>Anthony Monday</em> series, Alpheus Winterborn left his business and most of his money to his son Alpheus Junior when he died, and very little to his sister (he was on the outs with her, though apparently not enough to keep him from visiting from time to time during the last two years of his life) and her son. The son, Hugo Philpotts, has always felt he should have gotten more and is now determined to claim his uncle's hidden treasure to make up for it.

</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToniKelner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToniKelner">Toni Kelner</a> used this in at least two of her series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LauraFlemingMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LauraFlemingMysteries">Laura Fleming Mysteries</a></em> features a reversal in the very first book. Reverend Glass, who runs the church next door to Ellis "Paw" Burnette's house, has been after him to leave his house to the church so they can expand. He's most dismayed to find that Paw left it to his only surviving sister Maggie (and asked her to leave it to the titular character, his granddaughter, in Maggie's own will), due to the Burnettes having long since sworn to keep the house and what was left of their land in the family after having had to sell off a lot of the property during the Depression.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FamilySkeletonMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FamilySkeletonMysteries">Family Skeleton Mysteries</a></em> features a past attempt at this in book 3. Treasure Hunt (real name <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nelson Paul McQuaid III</span>) left home to live his own life rather than follow what his father wanted and was cut from his father's will in retaliation; however, the man wasn't able to fully disinherit his son due to the conditions in Treasure Hunt's <em>grandfather's</em> will, which left <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">McQuaid Hall and a lot of surrounding property, now part of McQuaid University, to the eldest living male descendant in each generation.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyLSayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyLSayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>' <em>The Unpleasantness At The Bellona Club</em>, a wealthy widow leaves her fortune to her elderly brother and his grandsons, or, if he predeceases her, to her poor niece.

Wimsey finds out that the younger brother was left a significantly larger chunk than the elder, and asks if the elder felt passed over. It turns out the elder not only knew but approved since his brother had a wife to support but couldn't hold a job due to his PTSD, whereas he was single and had a steady job.
<ul><li> In the short story <em>The Undignified Melodrama of the Bone of Contention</em>, Lord Peter finds that an elderly misanthrope, hoping to break his family apart, willed his money to his youngest son before the deceased's burial, and to the elder son afterwards. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The older brother tries to hide the will until after the funeral, but the younger son's friends find out, steal the body and have it entombed above ground, not fulfilling the condition.

</li><li> In <em>Unnatural Death</em>, one problem is what motive the apparent murderer might have for her crime. One possibility Lord Peter investigates is that the murder victim actually has a nearer relative who will inherit instead of her grand-niece — who came to look after her in her old age and was assured she would inherit the money.

Subverted by Kraft's stepdaughter Valerie - he had actually named her his primary heir, with the stipulation that Ned got everything meant for her if Valerie predeceased Kraft (which is what happened).

In a happier turn of events, Concepción subsequently meets Fran, who can't bring herself to mention the money and instead welcomes her into the family and invites her to Fran and Maxwell's upcoming wedding. This act of kindness leads Concepción to willingly share her inheritance with her siblings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> had Tony being contacted by the estate of a wealthy uncle that had recently passed. Believing he was about to come into, he spends the entire episode trying to call back, all the while making plans to purchase an expensive sports car. Finally, in the end, it is revealed that he's getting nothing and the whole estate went to a cousin who cared for the uncle when he was sick and gave his eulogy. What Tony was being contacted over was the cousin found evidence that Tony owed the estate money for his student loans, and now wants him to pay up.
</li><li> A sketch of the short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> series <em>Nick Swardson's Pretend Time</em> revolved around a cat who is wheelchair-bound after receiving a massive inheritance from his late owner and nearly being killed by his enraged son.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em>, during the reading of Caesar's will, Atia and Antony are shocked that Octavian gets it all. Antony's reaction also foreshadows the conflict between him and Octavian.

Hank expects he will be getting everything or at least a boat. However the uncle leaves almost everything to his young ward, and all Barb gets is a small case of jams. (This isn't out of spite - the ward clearly needed the support and money far more than the Thundermans did, but Hank is still upset.)
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em> episode, a wealthy millionaire performed this to make sure his son wouldn't be lazy. He donated the estate to charity and left his son a Bible in an orphanage in a nearby town.
</li><li> Brazilian TV show "Você Decide" (You Decide) had one episode where a wealthy man didn't want to leave his children (his son and his daughter) anything more than what was required by law. (Brazil is one country where one cannot completely disinherit one's children) He made a will bequeathing everything else to a center of medical research. It also includes a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. When his children (even as adults) kept mooching off him, he had them sign IOU notes for any money he gave them. (According to Brazilian Law, anything a father gives his children while he's still alive is considered early inheritance).

They get Gianni Schicchi to impersonate Buoso on his deathbed so a new will can be made. The new will gives the church a token amount, Buoso's relatives more, and Gianni Schicchi the most. This leaves the relatives angry, but they can't do much except loot the house a little on their way out since it's better than nothing.

When the guests start dying, the obvious implication is that someone is unhappy with that decision and wants to increase their share of the inheritance by reducing the number of people the fortune will be divided amongst. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's actually the player's best friend, who doesn't care about the money and is offended by the fact that this will proves that her grandfather didn't care for her any more than he did anyone else. By eradicating the rest of the family, she hoped to become his favorite relative by default.</span>
</li><li> Multiple examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen">Long Live the Queen</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bennett was disinherited by his family after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunaway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunaway">running away from home</a>, and because of this, he wasn't home when his mother passed away, which subsequently estranged him from his siblings Brin and Banion. He lives with his wife and children in their home country and doesn't appear in most playthroughs, but should either of his siblings die or be stripped of their titles, he can pick up their titles by virtue of there being no one else who is entitled to them (neither Brin nor Banion has an heir).
</li><li> The former Duke of Ursul chose his younger child Julianna as heir over her older brother Ignatius; the reason for this decision is never given. This is part of why Ignatius remains in a loveless marriage with his philandering wife since he and his children have no titles to fall back on without her. If the player chooses to jail Julianna indefinitely, however, she has no choice but to give Ursul's title to Ignatius, and this will eventually prompt Ignatius to divorce his wife; it even opens up Ignatius as a potential romance option.
</li><li> If Arisse dies during the game, her title goes to younger son Kiran rather than older son Kevan. This is possibly justified in that Kevan is already an Earl, whereas Kiran and his siblings were fathered by a commoner and thus have no titles of their own.

Part of the reason this makes Cleveland so mad is that a good chunk of that estate was originally his—Loretta won almost everything in their divorce, despite the fact that she had cheated on Cleveland with one of his best friends. Junior, for his part, makes it clear he would share the money with Cleveland if he could (and <em>does</em> share it with the rest of their family).
