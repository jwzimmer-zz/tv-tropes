Also, outright controlling someone's mind tends to require either magic or technology, and depending on the nature of the story, the villain might not have access to either of those.
</p><p>To that end, mind control in some cases requires a lot of foreplay, independent of magic influence, on the part of the villain. You can't force someone to reject <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> until you pick away at their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealousy</a> and convince them they <em>want</em> to turn on their friends. You can't overcome the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust">Power of Trust</a> until you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">get them to doubt their own perception of reality</a> and make them <em>want</em> to believe you're the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>. You can't erase someone's memories until you talk them through the most painful ones and convince them they <em>want</em> to forget everything. You can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IControlMyMinionsThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IControlMyMinionsThrough">make someone join you</a> without convincing them their current life is worthless and they don't <em>want</em> to continue with it. It's <em>essentially</em> mind control, yes, but it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">more than mind control.</a></em>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>What makes this "more than mind control" rather than simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulation</a> is that this can still be <em>assisted</em> by magic or technology. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">Magic forces may be at work</a>, but it's really the despair, trickery, lies, and sometimes even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">carefully-selected</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">truths</a>, that are thrown in that successfully break the victim's spirit. Instead of the villain forcing a victim to do something against their will, the villain <em>changes</em> the victim's will. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">meets</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Break Them by Talking</a>. This can even be justified depending on the setting; a very common limitation on mind control across many different works (for example <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>) is that the would-be-controller simply cannot induce an idea or a command into the victim that is either completely alien to their mind or goes against their base instincts. Much like a body's immune system will fight against a virus or a bacteria, the mind in-question will recognize the thought as a foreign object and will resist or even completely reject it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>So, if you have to talk someone into mind control, what's the point of using magic or high tech at all? Creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">illusions</a> can help make your case. Isolation is key, so magically cutting them off from support is effective. Maybe science or sorcery is just needed to accelerate the effects. In extreme cases, outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> is utilized. This type of brainwashing, called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> in the real world, supposedly requires a minimum of 72 hours, but with a sci-fi or sorcerous catalyst, it can be achieved in less than 72 seconds.
</p><p>Also, it can overlap directly with actual mind control. In many instances, More Than Mind Control is simply a method of making the process of the takeover <em>easier</em>, because by removing their resistance to your ideas, you remove the struggle in taking control of their thoughts. By having them <em>submit</em> to you, they essentially hand their free will over to you, making your spell or device much more effective on them. It also makes it harder for them to revert, because they now have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInMindCOntrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInMindCOntrol">active resistance towards their own original beliefs.</a>
</p><p>More Than Mind Control requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharmer">charisma</a>, finesse, and a lot of patience, but villains usually don't mind because they find it so much more satisfying. They also get a great deal of amusement out of telling the victim's friends, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBrainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBrainwashed">I didn't force him to do anything he didn't want to do</a>." It's also more resistant to the powers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">friendship</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">love</a>. Plus, it's just a lot cooler to watch. Villains don't even necessarily need special powers to do it, if they can goad the hero into doing something they'll regret by pushing the right buttons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">The Corrupter</a> in particular is a master of the art.
</p><p>Sometimes, the villain will try this on the whole team at once; they're usually saved by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">The Heart</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>, who will point out the ways that the villain is distorting the truth. Usually accompanied by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation">Kirk Summation</a> to the culprit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">or something more violent</a>.
</p><p>This is a favorite technique of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastards</a>. Victims may or may not exhibit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlEyes">Mind-Control Eyes</a>. It also frequently comes with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep">creepy voice change</a>, which is probably as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to Darth Vader of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>.
</p><p>It's popular with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> villains and in the West, too. Indeed, it's been around much longer than television. This form of mind manipulation was, for example, a standard talent of personifications of despair in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Renaissance British literature</a> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene">The Faerie Queene</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PilgrimsProgress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PilgrimsProgress">Pilgrim's Progress</a></em>.
</p><p>Occasionally, the victim's friends will have a standard counterspell, anti-psionic technique, or other fantastic means of quickly canceling vanilla mind control common to the setting. Expect them to try it on the More Than Mind Controlled character, only to react in dismay as they realize: "He's acting of his own free will!"
</p><p>This is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, because real-life hypnosis requires that the person subconsciously want to do whatever they're doing. Even more so in that there does not appear to be any true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">mind control</a> that works in real life, only more and more extreme versions of More Than Mind Control that can in extreme cases appear like straight brainwashing to third parties. The general term for this is coercive persuasion, and it is used by most cults, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Church of Happyology</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSvengali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSvengali">Svengali mentors</a> will use this. Psychopaths, or at least the intelligent ones, are also very good at using this in real life to make their way up in the world and get girls. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering">Social Engineering</a> is a milder (but no less nefarious) form often employed by shady types like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">con artists</a> and spies in persuading their victims to turn over passwords or sensitive information, to trick them into paying for fraudulent goods or services, or even gain access to restricted areas. Oftentimes this takes the form of phishing, a real life tactic used by cyber-criminals to gain access to the computers and accounts of unwitting victims by convincing them to install spyware or computer viruses, or even to suck their bank accounts dry by participating in costly scams.

The spell is not inherently evil, but see below.
<ul><li> One spell, named <em>Suggestion</em>, fits this trope to a tee - the more reasonable and/or in line with the target's inclination the Suggestion is, the harder it is to resist, even to the point where phrasing it differently can affect things ("Go jump in that vat of acid!" vs. "How about a nice bath?", for example).

</li><li> The first part largely works under Tzeenchian rules (being the master of scheming to the point that he doesn't see the future, he sees ALL POSSIBLE futures and works things to the one that benefit him the most.) Slaanesh is right on as well. Even Papa Nurgle is surprisingly duplicitous: he won't 'cure' the plagues he gives you, he'll just make sure you're happy about it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Khorne</a> on the other hand...

Whereas Majesty allows very powerful emotional control with some compulsion as well. Pairing both makes most humans (and quite a few vampires) ridiculously easy to control. Add in the addictive vampire blood vitae and its natural ability to make the drinker obey and love the vampire and... well, let's just say more than a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shells</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRenfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRenfield">mad Renfields</a> have resulted.

<ul><li> The Presence discipline synergizes very well with Social Traits/Skills, and can work on crowds.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> there is an Epic Manipulation knack called "God's Honest". The scion gives a statement along with some gesture of sincerity: cross my fingers hope to die/pinkie swear/I give my word. If their legend rating is higher than or equal to the target's then they will believe the speaker without question. Only solid, incontrovertible proof can sway them to believing it is a lie, and even then it has to be a good speaker. On top of that, if the scion uses "God's Honest" to enforce a truth then almost nothing will convince the target that that truth is a lie.
<ul><li> There's another knack called "Inspirational Figure" which forces people to stop and pay attention to a speaker as long as he/she is saying something intentionally inspirational. Some GMs allow you to use these knacks together.
</li></ul></li><li> This is implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em> to be how possession by the demonic Shedim works. The victim is still present in their own head and unaware of the visitor, eventually coming to believe that the selfish and evil impulses sent by the demon are entirely their own idea. And since each suggestion has to be worse than the last, most of the demonic Band will work slow, easing a person down the road step by step.

Kazavon doesn't really mind, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">so long as he can cause misery and destruction</a>.</span>
</li><li> A simple matter of practicality in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em>.

Conversely, the same novel suggests that Arthas was capable of independent thought and rationalizing his actions as being his choice.

Although he does "brainwash" his victims with forced repeated viewings of <em>The Sound of Music</em>, his favorite means for messing with their heads is by bringing up things they'd rather not think about, questioning the purity of their motives, and fighting them with their own inner demons.

<ul><li> There are several references to Jillian's history of repeated captures and (apparent) escapes, implying that the events of the story are the culmination of an ongoing campaign of psychological manipulation.
</li><li> Note also that in the summer text updates, there is a reference to Jillian observing the work of her new Turnamancer, a unit specializing in part in manipulating an enemy unit to serve a new side, but deciding in the end that she "Didn't play right."
</li><li> With Wanda's arkenpliers, the corpses she "decrypts" genuinely seem to grow a sort of love for her, be it to worship her or think of her as a sister. It seems to warp entire personalities, like Ansom's. There <em>are</em> limits, however; the spell needs something to latch onto, and can't completely override their essential nature. In Ansom's case it twisted his religious zeal from Royalism to Toolism, and he shifted his priorities to match. His honor-obsessed brother was controlled right up until they started using tactics he considered too underhanded, at which point he defected to his original side.

<ul><li> "In the best cons, the sucker cons himself." To expand, you use their suspension of disbelief (whether denial or ambition) to get them to buy into your Big Lie.
<ul><li> Specifically, the whole point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering">Social Engineering</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In real life, any effective "mind control" usually amounts to this. Nazism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">cults</a>, propaganda, advertising, talking heads on the news: if anyone gets you to do anything, it's by convincing you that you want to do it, or have to do it.
</li><li> Abusers often do this to their victims, convincing them that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victims</a> who deserve their mistreatment. They also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">deny that they are in the wrong</a>, convincing the victim that they're doing wrong instead.
<ul><li> Or, alternatively, rapists that use natural body reactions (such as a women's vagina being lubricated or a man having an erection) to convince the victim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization">that they enjoyed it to keep them from claiming it was rape</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hypnotism only works if the planned subject is <em>willing</em> to go along with being hypnotised, and even when under hypnosis, the subject will only go along with the hypnotist's suggestions if they <em>want</em> to do whatever the hypnotist tries to "make" them do. That said, when in a trance, the subject does become generally more susceptible to suggestions, and if the hypnotist can somehow frame a suggestion in the right context, it is easier to trick the subject into doing something they wouldn't normally do.
<ul><li> In the 1950s, an unethical hypnotherapist induced a patient of his to rob a bank in part by convincing him that the take would be used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">fight communism</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Not exactly mind control, but there is the curious case of the debate about whether the administration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoChavez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoChavez">Hugo Chávez</a>, former President of Venezuela, was authoritarian or not. While there's no doubt that he had no problem stamping out opposition, for the most part he actually didn't have to. He was <em>genuinely</em> adored by many Venezuelans, enough to win three elections fair-and-square, and so he could often let his supporters silence his critics for him without actually having to do anything. For example he allowed freedom of the press, but only because his critics were automatically relegated to the fringes by society already.
</li><li> The discoveries made by the field of memetics are often utilized to do this on a widespread scale. A properly-created meme that is funny enough, cute enough, or (the most effective) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">rage-inducing and argument-provoking</a> enough can cause an idea to 'infect' huge swaths of the population. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> does make this very unpredictable, the result is essentially mind control on a massive scale. Numerous pervasive cultural artifacts of the modern age, such as the widespread fear of Islam in the United States, the anti-vaccination movement, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Scientology</a>, are believed by some scientists to be products of highly successful memes that have infected large numbers of people, deliberately or otherwise.
