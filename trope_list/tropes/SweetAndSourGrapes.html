<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>.The protagonist, Miho, who doesn't think winning is everything, <em>has</em> to win, lest <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her school shut down, resulting in her and her friends being separated</span>, something she finds out when she's prepared to surrender to prevent people from getting hurt. Her older sister Maho, who follows their family's ideology of winning at all costs, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">does so in order to allow Miho the freedom to live and practice tankery the way she wants, and gladly accepts defeat against Miho, especially now that she's found a way of tankery that she can call her own</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji">Muhyo and Roji</a></em>, during the decision on whether to choose Muhyo or Enchu for the post of Executor, the committee found some factors that made Enchu, who was desperate for the position when Muhyo was apathetic, less suited to the position, especially his preoccupation with his sick mother (whom he had hoped to support with his job, and who died <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as part of Teeki's plan to corrupt him</span> shortly before the decision). According to Page, thing Enchu lacked that Muhyo had was "thinking of others,"; Muhyo had said if he was appointed, he would give the position to Enchu.
</li><li> In the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, Kirie, the first to pilot after the realization that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the loser's universe is destroyed</span>, enters his battle unwilling to fight because that revelation, combined with some of his personal issues regarding his family, makes him wonder whether the world deserves to continue existing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the cost of another's existence</span>. At that moment, his opponent commits suicide, and surprisingly enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he lives through the fight because he didn't move Zearth. He regains his resolve in time to pilot again, defeat his enemy, and die like everyone else</span>.
</li><li> This comes up fairly early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki">Saki</a></em>. In Saki's first few matches with Nodoka, she ends up with the same score she started with, which, despite indicating Saki getting in second or third place out of four, shows that Saki has almost superhuman skill and luck at mahjong- Saki adopted this tactic because her parents would punish her if she won or lost family mahjong games, causing her to dislike the game itself. Nodoka, who has played in mahjong tournaments, and is trying to get her father to allow her to stay in her current school by winning the national tournament, is infuriated with Saki's attitude toward winning and being effectively defeated by her in spite of that. However, Nodoka starts to warm up to Saki after Saki drops that playstyle, and reveals that she hopes to see her estranged older sister again in the national tournament and reconcile with her, so the trope stops being in play after a few chapters.

He came to the tournament intending to wish for a cruise ship so he could take his family on vacation. However, he is inspired by the heroics of his teammates and instead wishes for the revival of all the losing universes. The Grand Priest reveals that the whole tournament was essentially a test to see if the winner would be willing to show compassion to those of other universes. If a selfish wish had been made, Zeno would have erased everything. By making a selfless wish, 17 proved that the multiverse deserves to exist. Bulma goes on to reward 17 by buying him the cruise ship he wanted.</span>

Furthermore, she returns his feelings after the conversation they have makes her realize everything he's been through and remember every timeline herself.</span>

All For One shows his brother a man whose Quirk causes his parents to be disgusted by him, and a Quirkless man who can't defend himself from those with powers. He solves the problem by giving the former's Quirk to the latter, with the expectation that both men will be in his debt and help him when he needs it.

Original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHeroOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHeroOrigin">Super Hero Origin</a>; genius scientist Alec Holland, while researching a plant growth formula that he hopes will end world hunger, is killed by a bomb planted by a jealous fellow researcher who covets his wife. His body, soaked in the formula, falls into the bayou where The chemicals, and forces within the bog, mutated (him) into a muck-encrusted mockery of a man! Except, that's not what happened. Alec Holland died in the original attack. His body fell into the bayou. The plants in the bayou ate his body, soaked in the growth formula, "And they become infected by a powerful consciousness that does not realize it is no longer alive!" Swamp Thing is thus not Alec Holland, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">"a plant that THOUGHT it was Alec Holland...

He never was Alec Holland... He's just a ghost... A ghost dressed in weeds."</a> Bummer, eh? Except that where a human turned into a plant is a monster seeking to regain his humanity, a plant with the mind and memories of a human is <em>an extension of all plantlife on earth.</em> It can perceive all that occurs among plantlife. It can recreate itself anywhere plantlife exists. And it can command that plantlife as an extension of itself.

</li><li> In a way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is actually this. Batman can never get back his parents and his war on crime serves not only as an outlet for his rage but also to try and ensure that no one suffers like he did, even if he has to do it alone. Ironically, through this and despite his status as a loner, he would end up with one of the largest families in the DCU, starting with his sons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Jason</a> (who despite it all, does sometimes make it back), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Tim</a> and Damian. Then we have his surrogate daughters in Barbara (who is Commissioner Gordan's daughter), Cassandra (whom he actually adopted) and even Stephanie. Then you have his various friends and confidants in other heroes and the Justice League (special mention to Superman and Wonder Woman). And of course, surrogate father figure Alfred and surrogate mother figure, Dr. Leslie Thompkins. So, Batman's decision to love in spite of his crusade rewards him with the family he lost.

Naturally, each one botches the tryouts for the one they wanted due to stressing over what to do, but they succeed in getting a spot on the other's team, leading the first girl to wonder why she couldn't do well when it mattered for her.

The first time he is denied when he puts on a good show and talks about how he's been rehabilitated and has served his penance, sounding like a typical inmate and he is summarily rejected. When his turn comes back around years later, and after Andy escapes he then talks down to the parole committee, describing them as a bunch of young, college-educated suits using made-up words to describe washed-up old cons and saying he doesn't care whether they approve or deny his parole request, sounding instead like the wizened old man that he was...they set him free.
<div class="indent"><strong>Red:</strong> "I know what you think [rehabilitated] means, sonny. To me, it's just a made-up word, a politician's word, so that young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie and have a job. What do you really wanna know? Am I sorry for what I did?... There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then, a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I wanna talk to him. I wanna try to talk some sense to him — tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I gotta live with that. Rehabilitated?

In the story, a wandering knight rapes a young maiden and is sentenced to death. He begs the queen of the country for a chance at redemption, and she offers him a challenge: he has one year to find the answer to the question "What does a woman want?" If he gives a satisfactory answer, he'll live, and if he fails to come up with a solution, the death sentence will be carried out. The knight travels around the world, asking various wise people for answers, but none are correct. When his time is almost up, an ugly, elderly woman offers to teach him the secret if he agrees to do her a favor. The knight agrees, and the crone explains that what women really want is the freedom to make their own choices.

He accomplishes a number of good deeds but to no effect because by thinking about the wand while performing the actions, he renders the otherwise-selfless actions selfish. Only after he has become disenchanted with the whole idea and completely forgotten about the magic wand does he complete the task and summon the wizard.

</li><li> Many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> books have the heroes go on a life-changing journey across Xanth in order to accomplish some goal or obtain something they think they need, but when they finally get there, they don't want it any longer, because the life-changing journey changed their life and priorities. On the other hand, the same journey has enriched their life, broadened their horizons, and (extremely often) helped them to fall in love with one of their stalwart companions. Other times, the trope plays a little straighter. In the course of their journey, their original goal is set aside in light of a greater mission they must undertake. Upon completing the mission, they usually have to be reminded about their original goal...and find it has either been rewarded to them or they achieved it during their mission.
</li><li> Jeaniene Frost's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> series has somewhat of an odd example: Mencheres' wife has recently died, he's lost his ability to see the future, and he doesn't feel his people need him anymore, so he attempts suicide to prevent an old enemy from manufacturing criminal charges that ensnare his partner. Only, in the process of trying to end his life, he meets the new love of his life, leading to him regaining his ability and turning the tables on the bad guy. As a bonus, his second wife isn't the murderous bitch his first one was.
</li><li> Bertol Brecht's play <em>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</em> (which is itself based on an ancient Chinese play, <em>The Circle of Chalk</em>) features an example similar to the "Wisdom of Solomon" mentioned below. The wife of a grand duke gives birth to a child but abandons it while fleeing a coup, and the boy is found by a poor peasant woman, who raises the baby as her own. Eventually, though, the birth mother returns, demanding her infant be returned to her (though she only wants this because she needs her son to claim an inheritance). The local judge determines that the best way to determine who is the child's true mother is to draw a circle of chalk on the ground, place the toddler in the middle, and have the two women engage in a tug-of-war using the infant's body as a rope — if they both pull, he'll be torn in half, and each will get a portion. The birth mother cruelly yanks the infant toward her, but the peasant woman, rather than harming the child, instead releases its arm, fearful of hurting him. The judge thus decides that the peasant woman is the boy's mother, as she couldn't bring herself to see her baby harmed. As an added bonus, the judge also "accidentally" divorces the peasant woman from her cruel husband, freeing her to marry the man she loves.

When Ron is about to apologize, Harry realizes he doesn't need to hear the apology. Just knowing Ron was going to make it was enough, and forgiving him before he could apologize will repair the friendship that much faster.

Harry refuses to do so, despite this goal causing him to separate himself from Ginny and lose all hope of a safe, normal life, on the grounds that he'd rather sacrifice his personal desires to ensure no one else is hurt by Voldemort. Even when he learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he needs to let Voldemort kill him to ensure Voldemort's demise, completely removing any chance at all of returning to his loved ones</span>, he goes through with it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out the whole thing was a gambit set up by Dumbledore. Turns out that Voldemort damaged his soul so much that when he tried to kill Harry and gave him that scar as an infant, he made Harry into an <em>8th Horcrux.</em> This explainstheir connection, Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue and so on. Harry willing letting himself be killed instead kills off the soul fragment in him and leaving Voldemort more vulnerable (with the last horcrux being destoryed in Nagini thanks to Neville) and leaves him just as himself. Not only that, but because Harry willingly died to protect everyone helping him, he invoked the same magical protection his mom gave him, ensuring that Voldemort really <em>can't</em> hurt anyone else for the rest of the battle. Voldemort loses when he tries to use the Elder Wand on Harry (but due to wand rules and disarment, Harry became the master after disarming Draco who became it after disarming Dumbledore). The wand refuses to kill its master and backfires, ending Voldemort once and for all.</span> And then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow">Where Are They Now</a> epilogue confirms that Harry ends up marrying Ginny and having the family he's always wanted.

Cue <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, where she gives birth to a perfect baby girl immediately before being transformed, becomes a newborn with perfect self-control and almost no bloodlust, remains in contact with her parents, her father aware that she's not human exactly anymore, has a cottage in Forks with Edward (neither show any signs of moving out anytime soon), and neatly avoids any Jacob or werewolf-related trauma when Jacob <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">imprints on her daughter</span>, making everything quickly resolve itself.

When he does after a few months of traveling and growing together, he realizes that if he rewarded her for her good behavior, it would cheapen their friendship into a transaction (relevant to both of them, because Meg's abusive stepfather alternated soul-crushing punishments with lavish rewards, and Apollo's relationship with the Sybil of Cumae soured when he granted her immortality and demanded her services as oracle in return). Meg agrees, but shyly asks if it's too much to ask for a unicorn. Apollo gives her one, as a gift between friends rather than payment.

But the seeds were there from the beginning:
<ul><li> In one Season 2 episode, the main cast ends up stuck in an airport on Christmas Eve, and their airline loses the luggage containing the girls' presents. Everyone complains about this, but Jesse inspires everyone to change their minds by pointing out that Christmas is based on feelings, not material things...and then he starts comparing the items in the airport to <em>material things</em> (a vending machine becomes a Christmas dinner, for example). To make matters worse, the next day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">the real Santa Claus</a> shows up and uses his magic to make the lost luggage appear, so the girls get their gifts anyway.
</li><li> A similar treatment became even worse later in the show: Jesse notices that Stephanie and Michelle are being especially greedy one Christmas season, so he promises them a great gift. The gift turns out to be their spending time volunteering at a local homeless shelter, so they can get an idea of how lucky they are. Unfortunately, not only do the girls still get a good pile of presents, <em>we never see them volunteering</em> — they just come home and talk about what an eye-opening experience it was. That's all kinds of wrong.
</li><li> In "The Day of the Rhino," Michelle sends away for a toy advertised by Rigby the Rhino, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>. When the toy turns out to be much smaller than advertised, she, her friend Denise, Joey, and Stephanie all travel to the mall during a Rigby performance and angrily protest. It seems as though they're unsuccessful, but Joey encourages Michelle to take heart: she may have been ripped off, but her good deed has kept other children from making the same mistake. Seconds later, the doorbell rings — it's Rigby, and he's so touched by Michelle's protests that he's decided to give everyone who ordered a toy a free large doll, starting with her.

Carl is understandably upset about the loss but does his best to remain professional, especially since the new captain is a nice, if indecisive, guy. Things get tense when a major gang war is in danger of breaking out, and the captain can't decide what to do. He sincerely begs Carl for help, and though he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">briefly tempted to let his rival fail</a>, he ultimately realizes that the innocent lives at stake are more important than his envy, and develops a plan which averts the fight. When the commissioner shows up and praises his son for a job well done, Carl remains quiet rather than complain, which ends up being the right choice, as the captain admits that Carl was the one who solved the problem and deserves the leadership role more than he does. It also turns out for the best for him — he actually <em>preferred</em> his old job and never wanted to be captain in the first place. The commissioner, impressed by the whole situation and with a newfound respect for Carl, promotes him to captain and restores his son to his previous position, while the younger men remain friends and colleagues.

Heaven had all his mortal enemies, and Hell all his friends.
</li><li> King Solomon is an interesting take on this trope. God offered him a gift of whatever he wanted, such as riches or lovers or what have you. Solomon, terrified that he's going to screw up while he's on the throne, asks God for wisdom instead. By choosing wisdom, he shows that he already possesses that quality, because with wisdom all the other offered things can be obtained, however, none of the other things can impart wisdom itself. God is so impressed that he gives him all the things he <em>didn't</em> ask for, reasoning that a man whose first concern was to rule <em>well</em>, rather than to surround himself with riches, was the sort of man who <em>deserved</em> riches.
<ul><li> Another example featuring Solomon is so well-known that it's become known as the "Wisdom/Judgment of Solomon." Two women who have recently given birth appear before the king, explaining that during the night, one of the mothers rolled over on her child and smothered him to death. Each woman claims that the living infant is hers, and the dead one the other woman's. Solomon announces that, because the truth cannot be determined, he will cut the child in half and let each woman have a piece. One agrees, but the other instead tells the king to give the whole infant to her rival, rather than see him killed. Solomon thus announces that the mother who was willing to give up her child to another woman is the <em>true</em> mother, as only she would rather suffer the pain of losing the child than have him be murdered.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in "The Parable of the Beggar and the Diamond," a Hindu myth. One day, Parvati, wife of the god Shiva, becomes distressed when she sees an old beggar named Ramu being tormented by children on the streets; Ramu becomes so distressed that he curses his fate. Parvati begs Shiva to aid Ramu, and he does so by summoning a gigantic diamond—big enough to ensure the man's wealth for generations — and dropping it into his path. However, by this point, Ramu has had some time to reconsider his rash prayer and begins listing all of the things that <em>aren't</em> wrong with him—for instance, he still has his sight. To appreciate that gift, he shuts his eyes and walks for a little while...moving right past the giant diamond. Ramu then opens his eyes and praises the gods for his ability to see, then continues on his merry way; Shiva puts the diamond back where it came from and instead places a sturdy stick in Ramu's path, knowing that he'll find it.

These words lit a fire under Zayn, who put his career on the line and slapped Neville in anger, finally done with being the nice guy that always has to show respect.

At this point, he is able to use it again, just in time for an operation that would be impossible without it.
<ul><li> When Derek first uses the Healing Touch, his boss warns him not to use it at all - it takes a great toll on the mind and there's the risk of becoming reliant on it. So refusing to use it <em>unless it's critically important</em> is the best solution, and it's that realization that gives Derek the power back.

Just as she's explaining to her friends why she chose to give up on her lifelong dream rather than her honor, Captain Spitfire runs up and points out that she <em>agrees</em> with Rainbow Dash that—contrary to the belief of everyone involved, including Lightning Dust—Lightning was grossly out of line, and if Rainbow'd bothered to stick around for ten more seconds after dropping out, she'd have been told that sooner. After unceremoniously booting Lightning Dust out of the program, Spitfire makes Rainbow Dash the new cadet team leader at least in part that the Wonderbolts need a new recruit of such character who is willing to sacrifice her dreams on a matter of honor.

However, when Cozy flunks, Twilight believes the CMC intentionally set Cozy Glow up to fail in revenge for not being allowed to attend the school and bans from the school grounds. Fortunately, Cozy Glow later admits her mistake; she deliberately failed her test in hopes that it would convince Twilight to let the CMC be students like they wanted, and Twilight allows them to come back to the school not as students but as official friendship tutors.

Despite Trixie repeatedly proving to be an unfit vice-headmare, Starlight can't bring herself to drop her from the interview process due to wanting to work with a friend so much. Later on, Trixie teleports a portion of Froggy Bottom Bog into the school, unaware that it had a hive of flash bees in it, endangering the students and creating a mess in the classroom. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">After Starlight blows up at her for her actions</a>, Twilight helps her realize that hiring someone for a job is about who's most qualified regardless if they're a friend or not.

Once they stop obsessing, a welcome pregnancy can come along.
</li><li> Romance. Many people have observed that it's only when you stop trying to find romance that you actually succeed. Probably because when you're trying really hard, you come off as desperate, which is not attractive. When you stop obsessing over whether or not you're in a relationship and learn to be happy with yourself as a single person, you come off as confident and self-possessed, which <em>is</em> attractive.
</li><li> The same can be said for friendship and being liked. Some people try <em>way</em> too hard to be cool or likeable, which makes them come off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> poser who reeks of low confidence and either drives people away or attracts insults and bullies. These same people will find that, by just chilling out and not caring if they impress others or not, people are a lot more attracted to them as they're more fun and pleasant to be around. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>" is a lesson hammered into our heads for a reason, after all.
</li><li> Most cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance">Magnum Opus Dissonance</a> — given up trying to write that bestseller? Cue writing a bestseller!
</li><li> Lost something in the house? Good way to find it: Stop looking for it! You'll run <em>right</em> into it.
</li><li> Trying hard to remember something? <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presque_vu">Relax<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it will pop into your mind later.
</li><li> This trope happened to athletic boater Lawrence Lemieux in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">the 1988 Seoul Olympics</a>. During a race where Lemieux was in second place and all but guaranteed to advance to the medal round, he noticed that the Singapore team had capsized, were injured, and the crew was in serious danger of drowning. Deciding that winning a medal was not worth letting people die, Lemieux turned back to save the Singapore team, even waiting until rescue workers arrived before rejoining the race, and Lemieux came in dead last. However, since the world saw this act of selflessness, the International Yacht Racing Union unanimously voted to officially award Lemieux with second place anyways. In the end, Lemieux didn't get a medal for a top-three place in the medal round... but he was awarded the Pierre de Coubertin Medal, the supreme and rarest of all Olympic medals, for exemplifying the spirit of the Olympic games at its finest.
</li><li> In a 1973 Formula One race in The Netherlands, British driver Roger Williamson crashed and got trapped upside-down in his burning car. Fellow countryman David Purley pulled over and ran to the scene to try to save Williamson's life (disqualifying himself from the race to do so), but he was unable to put the fire out and burned himself trying to turn Williamson's car over. Williamson died in the accident, but for his bravery, Purley was awarded the George Medal (the second highest possible civilian award for bravery) by the British government, and the Jo Siffert Trophy by Formula One.
</li><li> Sarah Hughes at the 2002 Winter Olympics was 4th place in the Women's Figure Skating. Knowing she was out of the running for the medal, she seemed to relax and just enjoy her routine (which was practically flawless). The leading three made mistakes in the last round, leaving Sarah to collect the gold.
</li><li> Sometimes it's easier to find a good movie or television show on accident, rather than spend hours searching for one on streaming services or in stores.
