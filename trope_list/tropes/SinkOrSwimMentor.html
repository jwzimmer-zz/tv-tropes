There's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> with this guy. The bad news? That's because there's no training at all with this guy, at least, not before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">you've already survived a pretty critical situation</a>.
</p><p>The Sink-or-Swim Mentor is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a>: the strong survive, so it's best to cull the weak as quickly as possible. So instead of training a student for any length of time, this mentor throws them in at the deep end, where his own life — or that of others — depends on his success.
</p><p>Well, maybe that's a bit extreme. This character can exist in any type of setting, and it's unlikely that an accountant or receptionist would have lives depending on them. They might walk in the door only to be thrown an important project though, and be warned that a major client is relying on its completion.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This mentor is definitely at his most dramatic when lives are on the line though. He hands the hero the tools of the trade, be it a sword, a scalpel, or a gun, and tells him to get on with it. Often this mentor is such a cool character that it isn't until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> kicks in that the viewer thinks "Wait a minute...if the mentor's that good, why didn't he just save those people himself rather than sending a teenager to do it?"
</p><p>Occasionally justified in that the main character needs to be able to cope in that kind of situation in order to progress with his vocation; a dragon slayer who needs constant instructions is going to be turned into a kebab before he can say "Now what?" Sometimes, though, it seems as if the mentor is just stroking his own ego, forcing his student to prove themselves "worthy" of their tuition. Generally, however, a benevolent mentor will remain close by during the test-crisis, ready to assist when the students get in over their heads (but not a second before). If they're really feeling generous, the mentor will craft their own realistic crisis simulation so that the students can be tested without any undue risk (naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerRoomColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerRoomColdOpen">the student will be unaware of that detail until the end</a>).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Usually, after the initial crisis is resolved, the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">training</a> begins. If you're unlucky, this just consists of more of the same, but in ever-more-dangerous situations.
</p><p>Sometimes overlaps with being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Trickster Mentor</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor">Fair-Weather Mentor</a>. In the case of the latter, chances are that the poor student won't last long. He'll be tested so constantly that he's bound to fail at some point, in which case he'll be disowned. Their reliance on testing their student secretly means that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">Stealth Mentor</a> can easily be mistaken for one of these until they reveal that they haven't just been throwing them to the wolves.

<ul><li> Lisa Lisa (pictured above) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency</a></em> puts Joseph Joestar through a number of grueling exercises, including placing a "breathing correction" mask that forces him to either breathe in the proper manner required to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Hamon</a> or suffocate and kicking him down a pit and forcing him to climb up an oil-drenched pillar. The pit wasn't her usual method for a student so new, but Joseph was going to die anyway if he couldn't defeat two of the Pillar Men in a month's time. Regardless, her other student insists on joining.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> overlaps this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, while Ichigo trains with Urahara. The only difference is that rather than having real enemies trying to kill him, Urahara and his associates attempt to do it themselves. First lesson: defeat an opponent who will kill you if she manages to land a single punch. Second lesson: We'll separate your soul from your body, chuck you in a hole, bind your arms, and make you climb out before you turn into a Hollow. By the way, if you fail, we have to kill you for safety reasons. Third lesson: Knock my hat off with your sword. Of course, I'll be trying to kill you with my sword the whole time. Urahara's reasoning is apparently that if Ichigo fails here, he'd end up getting killed anyway, so he doesn't have anything to lose. However, they didn't have time for traditional training, having only two weeks to invade Soul Society single-handedly and rescue Rukia, so the more extreme "do or die" method of training was warranted.
</li><li> The teachers of the Team Summer A candidates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>. They teach them basic and intermediate survival skills, including randomly grabbing a student from behind, asking how they'll get themselves out of this mess. Things reach the peak during the Final Test when the teachers completely abandon the students and give them vague hints which may or may not help them survive, just so they can see which of the students <em>will</em> survive to be chosen to be sent to the future.
</li><li> The master <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lyu-Ui</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/IWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/IWish">I Wish</a></em> was this, especially towards K. He once actually took him to a cliff, asked him if he can swim and, when the answer was No, shoved him off the cliff and into the water. The purpose was to teach K the emotion of "getting a shock" but it actually is a Sink or Swim example.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eriol</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> combines this with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">Stealth Mentor</a> trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy">Dazai</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BungouStrayDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BungouStrayDogs">Bungou Stray Dogs</a></em> was this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Akutagawa</a>. He would punch, kick, and even <em>fire bullets at</em> the boy when he failed to meet his expectations, just so Akutagawa would become strong enough to survive in the Mafia. Overlapped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The headmaster of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">orphanage</a> is implied to be this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Atsushi</a>, although the mentee doesn't realize it until later. He purposely tortured the boy to ensure he would be ready to face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">crueler outside world</a> when he left the orphanage.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em>: K and Tohma, while not really mentors in the strictest sense of the word, figure that the best way to promote Bad Luck and inspire Shuichi is to throw the band in front of television cameras at the first available opportunity. This continues well into Shuichi's career, with most of the jobs that K lines up for him being done on the spur of the moment. Perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> (or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a>) by both K and Tohma's assertion that a true star should be able to cope with this kind of pressure all the time.
</li><li> Biscuit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterxHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterxHunter">Hunterx Hunter</a></em>. The first part of her training of Gon and Killua consists of having them fight for two weeks with a lunatic serial killer who is, by her own statement, stronger than either of them individually. If they don't manage to land a clean hit on him in those two weeks? She'll kill them herself.
</li><li> Kalos Eidos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em> subjects Sora to extremely hard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to get ready for her roles, and at one point he even fires her when she fails to meet his expectations. To be fair, the Stage's super star Layla was subjected to similar training, and at some point, she tells Sora <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that Kalos told her and Yuri Killian that they'd be fired if they didn't win the Circus Festival. And that was when Yuri and Layla <em>had pretty much reached their peak of popularity and techniques</em>, unlike Sora who still had a way to go</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, pretty much every single mentor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Tsuna</a> has had? It <em>does</em> tend to pay off, though - each time Tsuna goes through a life and death situation, he tends to come out with more badass weaponry.
</li><li> Meta Knight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em> isn't afraid to defend himself, but very rarely intervenes much beyond exposition and small pieces of advice when Kirby is facing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, leaving Kirby to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copy an ability</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">get with the ass kicking</a>, or Tiff to figure out the problem, or on occasion with other characters as well. Tiff frequently calls him out on this but eventually gives up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki">The Law of Ueki</a></em>, the rules say that a god candidate (the mentor) can't help their student in battle. If they do, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard">they get sent to Hell</a>. The end result: A bunch of junior high school kids with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">relatively useless or restricted supernatural powers</a> running around, who are essentially making things up as they go along. Kobayashi more so than the others. He didn't tell Ueki anything about the tournament until the poor kid had already gotten into a fight, and even then he only spilled because Mori and Ueki broke into his house. To be fair, though, Koba-sen did say he only participated in the first place to test Ueki's sense of justice, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">energetically told Ueki to drop out of the tournament and live his own life the way he wanted to before suffering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard">Mentor Occupational Hazard</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Evangeline foists this on Asuna to get her to use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb">Kanka</a> ability correctly. She dumps Asuna in the Himalayas, essentially forcing her to figure out the technique or freeze to death. The scary part is that this was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">admissions test</a>. Asuna was left with a (presumably) enchanted bell with which to "tap out", and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">refusal to do either that or die of exposure</a> was what convinced Evangeline to start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">training Asuna for real</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Evangeline</a> stayed in the mountains for the entire time, just in case something went wrong (presumably something along the lines of Asuna passing out from cold before being able to ring the bell). However, Asuna <em>did</em> pass out from cold before ringing the bell. Twice. The first time her repressed memory of how to use Kanka saved her, but by all rights, she should never have woken up the second time. When she did wake up she was covered in ice, unable to move, barely able to think, almost too far gone to reactivate the kanka and save herself. Chachazero even said, "she was almost dead, too!" If Eva had actually been there to save Asuna, that would have been the point to pull her out.
</li><li> Later on, Pseudo-Eva does this to Negi: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> either beat your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> into submission</span>, or die trying.

The weapon training at least was justified, with ninja as military forces. Traditional training methods tended to involve carefully choreographed full-contact kata with weapons which could at least cripple, the theory being that until you had experienced being on the wrong side of a lethal attack a few thousand times, you weren't emotionally prepared to handle a real battlefield.

<ul><li> Consider the ever-so-brilliant martial arts teacher, Genma Saotome. Genma's shown methods of training his son have included hurling a nest of agitated wasps at him and watching the poor bastard fend for himself, dragging him to a cursed training ground simply on the basis that it was dangerous and without finding out why it was considered dangerous, and reminiscing about how, when Ranma was a child, he routinely forced him to fight for every scrap of food he got, remorselessly eating Ranma's food if he couldn't defend it. He also admitted that he tried to "cure" Ranma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">Neko-Ken</a> induced cat phobia by throwing him into the pit of starving cats again.

Coupling this with his willingness to simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">throw Ranma into his own trouble and expect him to sort things out</a>, often with barely any idea what's going on or why it's happening, he could border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor">Fair-Weather Mentor</a>. If it weren't for his moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant">Idiot Savantdom</a>, it would be the conclusion of most fans that not only was Ranma lucky to survive, he's gotten as good as he has despite Genma's training, not because of it. And as bad as Genma is, Happosai is <strong>worse</strong>; his nature as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor">Fair-Weather Mentor</a> is an obvious fact.
</li><li> Cologne is just as bad, even if she (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">sometimes</a>) means well. The training for the Bakusai Tenketsu (swinging multi-ton boulders at the trainee until he can make them explode with a finger) and the Hiryu Shouten Ha (wrapping the person in "memory-metal" that will shrink, seize up, and lock down, turning him into a human pretzel if he sheds the slightest amount of heat) would be deadly if these people weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, and if they end up knocked unconscious from the blows, or drowning in a hot spring, well, that's their fault. Only by learning the fundamentals of these techniques <em>on their own</em> can the trainee even withstand the training itself.
</li><li> Interestingly, as Ranma's mentors are either this or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherMentor">Fair-Weather Mentor</a>, Ranma himself seems to take the Sink or Swim method. For example, in the Fine Dining arc, his needs to learn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">jab accurately and quickly with his utensils</a>, and his training plan involves setting up buckets and pots of hot and cold water so that if he fails, he turns back into a man in a very restrictive iron corset.

Justified by the incredibly grueling job of being a Judge, which doesn't allow for any margin of error. The only exception is the Psi-Judges, who have a slightly more lenient training, as the rarity of psychics means the Academy can't afford to waste recruits.

<ul><li> A Zen parable tells of a burglar who promised to teach the trade to his son. He takes the son to a rich and well-guarded house and shows him the way into the center of the house. Then the father excused himself, went outside, and promptly raised the alarm, alerting the entire house to the intruder - and sauntered on home. At dawn his son arrived, panting and exhausted but alone. "Why did you <em>do</em> that to me? I had to use all of my wits to get out of there!" The father said, "And that was our <em>first</em> lesson on burglary."

<ul><li> Granny Weatherwax is often the benevolent version, especially with Tiffany Aching. According to Granny "witching school" (i.e. the world) gives you the exam <em>first</em>, and then you spend the rest of the time finding out whether you passed. And everything is a test. Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AHatFullOFSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AHatFullOFSky">A Hat Full of Sky</a></em>, when Tiffany is engaged in wholly unjustified paranoia about the witch she's been sent to train with, she tries to tell herself that Granny Weatherwax and Ms Tick wouldn't have arranged it if it was dangerous... and then realises that they probably would, on the grounds that if she couldn't cope she'd have no business being a witch.

E. Doc Smith</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> series, the appropriately named Mentor of Arisia is an example of this trope. Though Mentor does relent and give the protagonist some training in psychic combat, he generally avoids directly aiding his students and criticizes them for asking him for help or advice when they don't really need it. And since he's effectively omniscient, he <em>always</em> knows whether or not they really need it. He "trains" Kinnison how to defend himself psychically by <em>continuously psychically attacking him</em>. The justification is that every mind is unique, so each person must develop his own method of defense. And the best way to develop callouses is to hit the tender part over and over. Though he does scale his attacks to Kinnison's ability to survive them.
<ul><li> Not just that, but the Arisians are this to the whole of Civilisation. They provide the Patrol with the Lens, but they very definitely refuse to provide any other assistance, of any kind whatsoever, either to the Patrol as a whole or to individual Lensmen (below Second Stage). They do not even provide any instruction on how to use the Lens - it is up to the Lensmen themselves to work out what it can do and how to use it. If Civilisation cannot defeat Boskone of its own resources with no more assistance from the Arisians than the provision of the Lens, then it is not yet ready to become a civilisation and Boskone will be allowed to defeat it and flourish until a more capable Civilisation can develop.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> <em>Triplanetary</em> reveals that the Arisians have tried this on numerous civilizations before the present one, almost invariably without success.

His way to teach a lesson starts with an offhanded mention of "one more possible solution" to the current problem, continues with sending an apprentice into action with a very vague idea of how they're going to do the job and ends with "See? You can do it easily... and there are old and supposedly smart wizards who still for some reason think it's impossible".

He had to beg Hermione to help him and she whispered instructions to him, helping him to successfully brew the potion.
</li><li> In Robert A. Heinlein's "Tunnel in the Sky", the protagonist has one last class before he is able to become a pioneer and help colonize other planets. The final class is survival on their own on an unknown planet, with unknown conditions, for an unknown amount of time. The students are allowed to bring anything they want with them that they can carry, and a pet, and most spend much of their time preparing what gear and gadgets they will bring. The protagonist asks his teacher what he should bring, and his teacher tells him he shouldn't bring ANYTHING, although he admits when the protagonist complains and says his sister, a survival expert herself, that he should at least bring a knife, that it makes sense. The protagonist ends up following his mentor's advice, takes the knife along with a blowgun and darts with poison, and finds out why firsthand when he meets his first classmate; he's been torn apart along with his dog, despite having some serious firepower. His mentor was trying to tell him that the biggest part of survival was the ability to adapt and respect your surroundings, something nearly impossible to do when guns and other gear make you over-confident.

A Gangrel will usually embrace the target of their choice, then abandon them to survive their first winter without guidance. It's a weeding-out process really; siring a mortal is relatively low cost, but caring for a fledgling can be challenging, risky, and time-consuming. So only those that can survive that long deserve to be taught. Not that the sire is the one to teach them, though. Usually it's the responsibility of whichever Gangrel finds them first. All Gangrel greet each other by asking "How Many Winters?", a question a newbie Gangrel is bound to get wrong. In that case, whoever found the neonate is responsible for them. So it's a Sink or Swim Mentor system where the mentors who do the mentoring aren't necessarily the ones who put them there in the first place.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Panthera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Panthera">Panthera</a></em>, you could argue that this is the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Tigris</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Onca</a>.

When Katara questions the effectiveness of this method, Toph agrees... then decides to make Aang do it blindfolded to force him to sense the boulder's approach through the ground.

She's very content with sending the Mane Six to be risking their lives in various missions, whether it be driving off a smoking dragon, saving an Empire from the dark essence of a fallen king, or even taming a mischievous-malicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>, all without getting directly involved. The only time she ever gets involved, as seen in "Lesson Zero", is when Twilight <em>really</em> screws up.
<ul><li> She pulled both in the very first episode, sending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">Twilight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">Sparkle</a> to make friends, brushing off her warning of the return of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Nightmare Moon</a>. Twilight declares "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">The fate of all Equestria does not depend on me making friends</a>". Celestia doesn't even bother to tell her that it actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">does</a></em>, and leaves her to learn about the Elements of Harmony all by herself (though, admittedly, learning about things is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Twilight Sparkle</a> does best).

Despite overcoming it enough to stop Dr. Eggman's latest plan, all it does is just <em>reinforce</em> Sonic's fear of water.

When Brock complains that he can't swim well, Gathers "motivates" him by throwing live grenades into the swimming pool.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, the paladins are trying (and failing) to form Voltron.

He ends up being this to himself. It makes as little sense as it sounds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YinYangYo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YinYangYo">Yin Yang Yo!</a></em>, Master Yo eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">fakes his death</a> in order to force Yin and Yang to face Eradicus on their own. In this case, however, it's not his usual method, but because they weren't even trying to get stronger and were simply making him constantly save them.
