</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Naturally</a>, this is often handled differently than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a>. An irrationally jealous female partner is often used as an element of comedy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">treated as "normal"</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">more inherently justified or sympathetic</a> behavior for a woman, whereas the irrationally jealous male partner is more likely to be treated as if he has a serious flaw: he's portrayed less sympathetically, criticized more harshly by fans, less frequently played for comedy, and has a higher tendency to either rape the girl he's in love with or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a>, rather than drag the object of their affections away by the ear or pummel them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleInTheSky">space</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceMallet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceMallet">Hyperspace Mallet</a>. Interestingly, though, at the far end of jealous insanity, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> is far more often female.

As long as the comedy comes from making the guy look like a fool and not from making his partner suffer, it's okay (though the latter being funny isn't statistically impossible).
</p><p>Of course, all bets are off when this trope is mixed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">Boys' Love</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>, which is certainly not all that rare; in fact, the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> examples tend to come from this field.

<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>, Urd's ex-boyfriend Troubador was one of these. According to Urd, back when they were dating he would use his powers to make bugs and insects crawl out of the bodies of any men who tried to flirt with her. He tried the same thing on Keiichi when he mistakenly believed Keiichi and Urd were seeing each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi">Ai no Kusabi</a></em>:
<ul><li> Riki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a> Guy. He is so in love with Riki that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gives him an unwanted penectomy (to remove the pet ring that was on his penis), as he's told that as long as Riki wears Iason's pet ring he'll never be free of him. He also blows up a fortress to kill Iason, Riki's lover</span>.
</li><li> Iason Mink himself is one of these, and like Guy, he becomes extremely obsessed with Riki. It's not touched upon in the OVA, but the novel and audio drama have scenes where Riki sleeps with a female pet and is subsequently brutally tortured by Iason for "betraying" him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear">Air Gear</a></em> the Agito side of Akito's personality is normally the rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> one but Akito is even shown to have a dark side of his own, becoming jealous to the point of scaring Kururu when she gets too close to Ikki.
</li><li> Elias from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride">The Ancient Magus' Bride</a></em> has had some moments of this; in particular, after his fiance Chise starts spending more time with friends, he doesn't know how to express his jealousy, and so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">transforms into his giant monster self and holds Chise a little too tight in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">shadow/tentacle cavern</a> until she threatens to kill herself to make him let her go</span>. And she's still all about staying with him afterwards.
<ul><li> Apparently he didn't learn his lesson the first time, because Elias takes it to the extreme when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he attempts to sacrifice Chise's ten-year-old friend Stella in order to save Chise's life</span>.

After Guts left the Hawks, Griffith's life went to hell and he grew to hate Guts and obsess over Casca instead. Learning first hand that Guts and Casca were lovers ultimately cause Griffith to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">snap</a>. No, it does not end well for either of them when the Eclipse goes down.
<ul><li> Guts himself has shades of this, due to his feelings towards Casca he gets angry that she blames him for Griffiths injuries and Guts bitterly laments to Judeau that Casca will never look past Griffith. Even after Guts is proved wrong and gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> with Casca, he still gets pissy that Casca still cares deeply for Griffith. Post-Eclipse Gutss fierce love for Casca is exploited by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">Enemy Within</a>, who plays upon Gutss sexual frustration (since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">he couldnt touch Casca</a>) and nearly forces him to ravish her.
</li><li> The King of Midland is this towards Charlotte. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Whose his daughter</a>. When the King discovers Griffith has taken Charlottes virginity, he personally whips Griffith and has him tortured for a year, then he tries to rape Charlotte while she sleeps. Last time we see the King before he dies hes still obsessed with his daughter and still loathes Griffith.
</li><li> Serpico is definitely this towards Farnese (whose his half-sister) since he has devoted his entire life to her and really doesnt appreciate Guts flipping Farneses world on its head. Serpico has fought Guts three times over Farnese and he even admits to Guts he wanted to kill him out of jealousy for giving purpose to her life. Thankfully Serpico mellows out and thanks Guts.

</li><li> Alois Trancy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> has tendencies of this sort towards Claude.

Also says he'll never let her quit, which is usually said in a cutesy manner, but can probably be mistaken for this trope as well.

Taichi seriously considers destroying it, but his jealousy surprisingly recedes when Chihaya suddenly appears at the match as well and the three old friends are reunited. However, he doesn't care when other any other guy looks at Chihaya, and barely reacts even when she's asked out, because he knows that a) the vast majority of guys get turned off when they realise what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> karuta fanatic she is, and b) she connects to people strongly through karuta so he only sees strong opponents like Arata as threats.

He has even gone so far as to trick a half-blind Shoei into thinking he was Mio so he could attempt to seduce him, later telling Mio that he didn't do that because he loves Shoei, but rather because he would be "willing to do anything if it means I could separate you from that guy".

She's reluctant to get involved with him because he always seemed "scary" and she was genuinely terrified of him for a bit, due to an incident when they were younger where she suspected that he pushed her down the stairs. She gradually develops feelings for him, but still has moments where she feels extremely put off and scared of his overly possessive and violent nature. His violent obsession over her develops to the extent where he firmly states that she's not allowed to even think of/love any other guy except him, even her own brother. He also demands that she should keep conversations with all men under one minute, answer the phone on the first ring when he calls, and show up at least an hour early to all dates; he also often overreacts when a male's name is mentioned in conversation, even if it's just her little brother. If he happens to see her with another guy, he tends to go off on a jealous rage and hit her. She finally tells him she can't be with him anymore when he orders her to make the impossible decision of choosing between him or her family. When she leaves, him he says, "That stupid woman... If she can't be mine she should just die." She eventually gets back together with him, though, and agrees to marry him at the end in the hope that he'll start being nicer to her if she stays with him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hatsumi ends up with Ryoki in the ending of the manga.

So, on one occasion when there's a scuffle going on, he tries to get Sen out of the way by stabbing him with a pencil - but accidentally ends up stabbing his inmate Walter instead, who was trying to protect Sen in the hope of getting protection from Swordfish. When he finds this out, Norman holds a knife to Walter's neck telling him, "If you don't want to die, don't butt in again, Walter!"

Because he doesn't love you. I'm the only one that can kill you."), rapes him with a mop handle, ties him up, and hides him in a dryer. And when Swordfish finds Sen, he gives him CPR. Lain responds to this by stabbing Fish in the arm with a fork and tries to stab him again while screaming at him, "Get off of Sen! He belongs to me!" Immediately after that, Lain is shot and killed by security guards.

</li><li> Poor Janet Van Dyne aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">The Wasp</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse">gotten several</a> of these over the years:
<ul><li> The first is David "Whirlwind" Cannon. Working as Janets chauffeur he made his move on her when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank</a> was seemly dead but to his fury she rejected him. He made several attempts to kill Hank and in a later comic he even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">molested Jan</a> while she was unconscious before being stopped by a ten foot tall and seriously pissed off Henry Pym.
</li><li> Similarly Erik Josten from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures">Marvel Adventures</a></em> due to his own obsession with Jan, made it look like Hank had disappeared in an attempt to get close to Janet. He failed to woo her and became enraged at Hanks timely return and desperately tried to kill him could have her for himself.
</li><li> In more recent comics Hank being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a> unfortunately has become this to Janet himself due to fusing his body and consciousness with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron">Ultron</a> (who incidentally is also obsessed with his mother). Ultron-Hank spells it out upon reuniting with his ex-wife saying he knows all about her new relationship with Tony and considers it a wrinkle in his schemes. Ironically hes still not as bad as Ultimate Hank when it comes to Janet (see below).

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickJonas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickJonas">Nick Jonas</a>'s "Jealous" is about the singer talking about how he feels jealous of other guys looking at his girlfriend. He says that even though he knows that she loves him, he wonders if she wants the guy who's eyeing her. He even says that it's his right to be hellish and jealous towards anyone who wants her.
</li><li> "Genghis Khan" by Miike Snow is about a man who is possessive of his lover despite not being in a committed relationship with her.
</li><li> "Come A Little Bit Closer" by Jay and The Americans is about an American tourist in Mexico who gets on the bad side of one of these when said jealous guy's girlfriend starts flirting with him:

He so strongly believes that he is entitled to seeing Makoto model with him (not to mention Makoto looking up to him as a brother again, or perhaps something more romantic) that in the Main Story he actually <em>kidnaps</em> him and traps him in a soundproof room, keeping him from sleeping and only allowing him to eat when Izumi's hand feeds him until he will be 'honest'. After Makoto gets out of this, he still routinely stalks him and is extremely clingy whenever they meet, trying to separate Makoto from any other potential friends and allies. Eventually, Makoto manages to strike a bargain where he won't run from him on sight if Izumi heavily cuts down on the creepy behavior; he only mostly succeeds, and while Makoto stops being scared of him, when Izumi graduates Makoto is still basically happy to see him go, even if he hopes he'll be successful (far, far away from him).

</li><li> Rio from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> is easily jealous and quick to temper when it comes to both his girlfriend Jerrica and his crush Jem. Luckily, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle">they are the same person</a>; unluckily, he doesn't know that. There's even a song called "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LptOaJpvrc4">Jealousy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" about Rio being peeved at Jem being around another man. Rio outright punched the guy in the face for kissing Jem <em>while filming a movie</em>. Rio isn't even dating Jem, he's Jerrica's boyfriend, which effectively makes him a cheater.
</li><li> Hades in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOfTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOfTheTitans">Class of the Titans</a></em>, though normally very pleasant, is this way regarding his beloved wife Persephone. She uses it to her advantage in one episode when his father Cronus attempts to invade the Underworld; by pretending to be interested in Cronus's advances toward her, she spurs Hades into action.
</li><li> Bender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, sometimes to love interests (such as Angelyne in "Bendless Love") but <em>frequently</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">his best friend Fry</a>. It provides a lot of impetus for the plot of the film <em>The Beast With a Billion Backs.</em>
<div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> Because Bender <em>knows</em> love.

In contrast with Marinette, Chat Noir's jealousy is less openly antagonistic...but he's also less willing to listen to his kwami when Plagg tells him what he's doing is wrong.

<ul><li> The famous Filipino painter Juan Luna endured a particularly gruesome example of this trope. Luna's marriage with his wife, Maria, in Paris, became increasingly unstable as he harbored suspicions of her going out with a Frenchman. It didn't help that he was part of a family known for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeneralLuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeneralLuna">legendary temper</a>. In a fit of rage, he got hold of a gun, stormed to the room containing Maria and her mother, and shot both in the head, killing them.
<ul><li> Murder charges filed against him were eventually done away with, possibly due to Parisian society then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">forgiving the crime of killing an unfaithful wife</a>.

</li><li> Despite being constantly unfaithful to her, OJ Simpson was very jealous of other men showing interest in his wife Nicole, both when they were married and after they divorced.
</li><li> John Sweeney, the boyfriend of actress Dominique Dunne, was very jealous, especially over actors with whom she did love scenes. She ended the relationship due to his abuse and possessiveness and was tragically killed by him. He was jailed for 6 1/2 years for manslaughter in 1983. The case provoked considerable controversy due to the perceived leniency of the sentence.
</li><li> Raoul Moat. After getting out of prison, his ex told him that she was in a relationship with a police officer (she was actually lying in an attempt to get him to leave her alone). He responded by posting threats to police and others on his Facebook profile and making further detailed threats in two subsequent letters and several phone calls to police stating he would continue to shoot police officers until he was dead. He then shot his ex and her new boyfriend (killing him and seriously injuring her), killed several other innocent bystanders and blinded a policeman. He later died of suicide after a standoff with police.
</li><li> Nikki Sixx wrote in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> autobiography <em>The Dirt</em> that he planned to shoot his wife's lover in the testicles, but realized he would ruin his own life by doing so.
