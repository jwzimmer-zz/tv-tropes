</p><p>This isn't just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily">Dysfunctional Family</a>, this is a family with members so numerous, relationships so tangled, and circumstances so bizarre that it's impossible to keep track of them without a flow chart.
</p><p>Tangled Family Trees are commonly seen in comics and soap operas, both of which have long-running continuities focusing on one group of characters through decades of changing hands from writer to writer. It is also a common phenomenon in mythology, folklore, and oral traditions for much the same reasons (with "long running continuities" being measured in centuries, and different "writers", including oral retellings by people who may or may not have been literate). Indeed, tropes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> and the Tangled Family Tree happening in modern works of fiction can help us understand exactly how ancient mythology evolved.

Only for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepCoverAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepCoverAgent">cover</a>, but it's still strange</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Let's map the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> family tree, which can be quite a doozy due to all the clones, adoptions, and miscellaneous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a>-related goodness. First there's the Takamachi family with Nanoha, who's now the adoptive mother of Vivio, who's now also the adoptive daughter of Fate, who in addition to being the creation-daughter of Precia (who was seeking to remake her own daughter Alicia, who would have been Fate's older sister if she were still alive), is also the adoptive daughter of Lindy, connecting her to the Harlaown family which includes Chrono, Amy, Erio, and Caro. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vivio was cloned from Olivie Segbrecht</span>, who has romantic ties with Klaus Ingvalt, the person Einhart was reincarnated from. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vivio</span>'s creator-father is Jail Scaglietti, who is also the creator-father of the Numbers, four of which are now <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a part of the Nakajima family</span>, and is also the creator-father of Zest's clone, who was the father figure of both Lutecia and Agito. He was also the co-creator of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fate herself</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Agito</span> has since been adopted into the Yagami family, which includes Hayate, Reinforce Zwei, and the Wolkenritter. Speaking of the Wolkenritter, it includes Signum, who is implied to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Agito's original Master</span> and thus the person she was born from. Incidentally, Reinforce Zwei was born from the Linker Core organ of both Hayate and Reinforce Eins (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which had been merged</span>). Back to the Nakajimas, Subaru and Teana seems to have romantic ties, and Subaru was going to have her father adopt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tohma, who is currently in a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with Lily and Isis, and is also being sought out by the Huckebein family since they plan to adopt him into their family</span>. All clear? Good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke, I Am Your Father</a>. Yuzu and her three extra-dimensional counterparts (Serena, Rin and Ruri) are reincarnations of Ray, the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Professor Leo Akaba, who was split into four when the original world was split into four dimensions. The Professor is also the father of Reiji, whose has an adopted sibling (Reira) through his mother, Himika. Yuzu also has another father, Shuzou (who may or may not be biologically related to her, though it's implied that he was merely given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> of being her father), and Ruri has unknown parents and an older brother, Shun Kurosaki. That makes Yuzu one-fourth of Reiji's older sister (despite being younger than him post-reincarnation) one-fourth of the Professor's daughter and the whole daughter of her adoptive father, and simultaneously is and isn't Kurosaki's sister. Reiji is somehow Kurosaki's half-brother, despite not being related. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Shuzou has four daughters, despite only having one daughter.</a> Reira, being adopted by Himika independently from the Professor, is only related to his mother and Reiji. Yuzu and her counterparts are biologically the Professor's kids, despite not fathering any of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> has one of these, once you bring all the relationships between the characters into it. A rough chart of these relationships looks <a class="urllink" href="http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6298/negima2.png">like this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> Even if one would remove everything but the romantic and family ties, it would still be a mess. Naturally, time travel and the creation of sentient robots factor into this. If you think about it hard enough, you can actually make a case that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild">Negi</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Chachamaru's</a> great-great-etc grandfather. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chachamaru's "mother", Chao, is actually Negi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a>.</span>

Explaining it would spoil the show so you've been warned. The short version of it is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">half the cast is related to Ayato</span> in one way or another. As for the long version: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maya, Ayato's adoptive mother is actually his aunt. She was married to Watari who is Ayato's father. Ayato's real mother is Quon, Maya's twin sister. Quon lived with Itsuki who claimed to be her brother. He is actually her son and Ayato's twin brother. For further confusion let us take a look at how the Shitow family factors into this. Rikudou was Maya's adoptive father and is the uncle to Haruka and Megumi Shitow, who are sisters. Ayato met Haruka earlier but her name was Mishima before her mother remarried so he didn't know it was her when he met her the second time. This led to Ixtli the soul of the titular RahXephon taking her form to try to guide Ayato</span>.

Then the first brother and two of his sons die, and the other marries his widow and adopts his surviving children, with the cousin/stepsiblings generally referring to themselves as "siblings."

<h2>Marvel</h2>
<ul><li> The Summers family of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> to itself - ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Scott Summers</a> started out as an orphan with no known family. Thanks to time travel and alternate realities, no fewer than three characters in the main continuity of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics can be said to be the child of Scott Summers, and none of them are more than about ten years younger than their parents. None of these children have full siblings in the continuities in which they live, either.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RachelSummers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RachelSummers">Rachel Summers</a> is the daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast">Days of Future Past</a> timeline. Upon arrival in the present, she suffers quite a bit of existential angst when she finds that in the new timeline she will never be born. She later joins the X-Men and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur">Excalibur</a>, and takes on her mother's mantle as Phoenix. In an alternate version of her original timeline, Rachel had a son named Jonathan with Franklin Richards who grew up to be the supervillain despot Hyperstorm.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Nathan Christopher Charles Dayspring Askani'son Summers</a>, better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable">Cable</a>, was the only one to be born in the main Marvel Universe timeline: he is Scott's son with Madelyne Pryor, who was later revealed to be Jean Grey's clone. Sent into a dystopian far future as a baby in order to save his life and raised under the name Nathan Dayspring, he later returned to the present day as a grey-haired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a>. The supervillain Stryfe is Cable's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">evil clone</a>, and may be the father of Cable's son Tyler Dayspring (the villain also known as Tolliver and later Genesis). Cable has also adopted a daughter of his own, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HopeSummers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HopeSummers">Hope</a>. Cable was also raised for twelve years by "Redd" and "Slym" Dayspring, who were actually artificial human bodies created for Jean and Scott (whose minds had been transported to the future) to occupy to raise Nathan.
<ul><li> A younger version of Cable, who may or may not be the original version's past self, was also recently introduced, and is colloquially called Kid Cable. He killed his original self and has demonstrated knowledge that the original Cable did not have at his age... but Jean is sure that he's her son and he's been treated as such.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan">Nathaniel "Nate" Grey</a>, aka X-Man, is Cable's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> counterpart from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a> reality, who was shunted into the main Marvel Universe timeline when it was restored. He was created by Mr. Sinister using Scott and Jean's DNA; despite being genetically identical to Cable, Nate Grey is significantly younger, and his relationship with Cable could generally be summed up as "grumpy younger brother".
</li></ul></li><li> There are also Scott's children seen in various alternate futures: probably the most significant being Ruby Summers, his daughter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bishop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bishop">Bishop</a>'s home timeline, who was a major supporting character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>. In the miniseries <em>X-Men: The End</em>, Scott and Emma are seen to have four children, including a daughter Megan Frost and a son Alex Frost-Summers.
</li><li> Scott's brother Alex adds to the complication in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers">Uncanny Avengers</a></em> storyline, where he marries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">Janet van Dyne</a> in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> — and have a daughter Katie, who is kidnapped by Kang and put in an isolated timeline so that she doesn't get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a> while they try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>. This daughter links the Summers to the equally convoluted Pym family tree, which includes more robots than you'd think.
</li><li> There's also a third Summers brother, Gabriel Summers aka Vulcan, the supervillain ruler of a galactic empire. Vulcan himself is married to Deathbird, former sister-in-law to Charles Xavier (Scott's childhood father figure), meaning we can add <em>him</em> to the list now, too. Since Deathbird is pregnant with Vulcan's child, that hybrid offspring adds another branch to the Imperial Sh'iar house. Please note that this means the Summers family <em>is now tied to an alien royal family</em>.
</li><li> Before Vulcan's introduction, several other characters were hinted as being the long-lost brother of Scott and Alex. Minor character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">Adam X the X-Treme</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">originally intended</a> to be revealed as the son of Catherine Summers and Shi'Ar Emperor D'Ken  Adam is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-human</a>, and Catherine was the only known human woman in Shi'ar space at the time  but this was never confirmed and the plot point was later dropped. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gambit">Gambit</a></em> was also considered to be made into the third Summers brother; in <em>X-Men: The End</em> he was made a product of Mr. Sinister and Scott Summers' DNA. Notably, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.uncannyxmen.net/sites/default/files/images/article/sinister.jpg">the panel that started this whole mess<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> only says "brothers" and doesn't imply a specific number, so there could potentially be even <em>more</em> Summers men.
</li><li> The villainous immortal Amanda Mueller was married to Daniel Summer and had a son who's the direct ancestor to Cyclops and company. Mueller also had the mutant daughter Fontanelle (but not by Daniel Summer).
</li><li> Scott, Alex and Gabriel's father is Corsair, who is a space pirate. Their mother is dead, but Corsair has been in a long-term relationship with alien cat-person Hepzibah.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MutantX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MutantX">Mutant X</a> timeline, Scott's brother Alex Summers has a son with Madelyne Pryor named Scotty. In the same timeline, Nate Grey was created by Mr Sinister as the son of <em>Alex</em> and Jean rather than Scott and Jean, although his DNA from Alex was later overwritten with Scott's DNA.
</li><li> Cyclops is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a>' father-in-law, although you do have to go through two different alternate timelines to get to that point. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX">Earth X</a></em> trilogy, it's revealed at the end of the first series that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Franklin Richards</a> is destined to take Galactus' place. And more than one timeline shows that he and Rachel would have fallen in love as young adults had she grown up in her own time</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a> are the crux of another nightmarish family tree usually seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> and related titles:
<div class="indent"><strong>Wanda:</strong> I think our family trees must be the most convoluted in <em>history</em>, Vision!
</div><ul><li> It Scarlet Witch and Vision's marriage. Vision is a robot built by another, evil robot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron">Ultron</a>, who was himself built by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Henry Pym</a>. Ultron has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Oedipus Complex</a> with both Pym and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">The Wasp</a>, considering them both his "parents", and bent on killing them.
</li><li> The Vision was built using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderMan">Wonder Man</a>'s brain patterns — in spite of Wonder Man being dead. When Wonder Man came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, much like Vision, he had a crush on Wanda.

The Vision was also built (or not) using the body of the World War II-era Human Torch, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> of its own.
</li><li> Scarlet Witch's twin brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, was formerly married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans">Crystal of the Inhumans</a>, and together had a daughter, Luna Maximoff. Crystal is currently married to Ronan the Accuser, and is the sister to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MedusaMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MedusaMarvelComics">Medusa</a>, Queen of the Humans. Medusa's husband is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackBolt">Black Bolt</a>, the king and head of the Inhumans Royal Family.
</li><li> Wanda is formerly-but-still-possibly the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>. Besides the Maximoff twins, Magneto also is the long-lost father of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Polaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Polaris">Polaris</a>. Had Polaris not been forsaken at the altar, she would have married Havok, one of the Summers brothers, and tied together the two biggest and most snarled family trees in Marvel.
</li><li> The Vision and Scarlet Witch have two sons (thanks to magic). They were both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">erased from existence</a>, but then reincarnated into Wiccan and Speed of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a> — a team with a <em>different</em> Vision, rebuilt from the original's brain patterns by Iron Lad, a younger persona of the time-traveler Kang the Conqueror. This led to a love triangle between Stature, Iron Lad, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the Vision with Iron Lad's brain patterns</a>.
<ul><li> Through Kang is a link back to the Summers family — he's a descendant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Doctor Doom and Nathaniel Richards</a>, the latter of whom is Mr. Fantastic's dad — and great-grandfather of Hyperstorm. This also throws in Nathaniel's family (including his other children), Kang and Immortus's litany of sons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">named Marcus</a>, and Kang's lady friend Ravonna who posed as Nebula for a while.
</li></ul></li><li> Wiccan's fiance is Hulkling, who's the son of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainMarVell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainMarVell">Captain Mar-Vell</a> and the Skrull princess Anelle. Mar-Vell also had an artificially conceived and forcibly-aged son, Genis-Vell, with his lover Elysius (herself an artificially-created being from the DNA of the Eternals of Titan). Genis-Vell, with his vast cosmic powers, did a Universal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> — and in doing so retroactively created his own sister Phyla-Vell. Then Phyla wound up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and in a romantic relationship with Moondragon, the daughter of Mar-Vell's old ally Drax the Destroyer.
</li><li> The Vision also built himself a robotic family - Virginia, his wife, who was constructed with the Scarlet Witch's brain patterns, Vin, his son, and Viv, his daughter.
</li><li> Ultron didn't stop with the Vision: he created Jocasta (with Wasp's brain patterns), Alkhema (from Mockingbird's brain patterns), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VictorMancha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VictorMancha">Victor Mancha</a> (who joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a>). In keeping with the Oedipal theme, Pym had a relationship with Jocasta after the Wasp died, and Alkhema has a "daughter" named Antigone.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy">Avengers Academy</a>,</em> the abomination that is the Pym family tree has another new branch in William Nelson, the son of Tigra, who is Hank's biological son via a Skrull infiltrator who was using his DNA at the time. From a certain point of view, this makes him Ultron's half-brother. A <a class="urllink" href="http://waitingforthet.tumblr.com/post/51584929655/im-gonna-start-posting-some-of-my-older-stuff-so">fancomic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> poking fun at William's family tree shows Wiccan playing with baby William. Hulkling asks how they're related and after doing some math, Wiccan concludes that the toddler is his great-uncle.
</li><li> In an alternate universe, Scarlet Witch has a daughter Nocturne with the X-Men's Nightcrawler. Since Nocturne lives in the main universe, by Marvel standards she would be included in Wanda's family tree (see: Summers family tree). This attaches Nightcrawler's mother, Mystique, Mystique's deceased wife Destiny and their adoptive daughter Rogue, and Mystique's current husband Charles Xavier into the tree as well as a few other notable characters.
</li><li> We can now add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnstoppableWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnstoppableWasp">Nadia Pym</a>, Hank Pym's long-lost daughter (from his first marriage, where his wife suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Death by Origin Story</a>) and the All-New Wasp, who get formally adopted by Janet.

<ul><li> Magneto has children with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> in at least two realities, Charles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em>, and Magnus, a member of the original Exiles team, in another timeline. In <em>Age of Apocalypse</em>, Rogue and Magneto's marriage created its own issues, because now Mystique and Destiny are both Magneto's mothers-in-law, Rogue is Quicksilver's step-mother (but somehow <em>younger</em> than him), Quicksilver is Storm's lover, and Rogue permanently absorbed roughly half the powers and personality of Polaris, Magneto's long-lost daughter who was on the enemy's side (but neither of them know it in this reality).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique">Mystique</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a>'s ex and mother of his son, Graydon Creed. It's been revealed that she may someday have children by <em>both</em> Wolverine and Charles Xavier, as said children (Raze and Charles Xavier II, respectively) have traveled back in time from the future. She's Nightcrawler's mother by Azazel (and she was once planned to have been his <em>father</em> instead, with Destiny as his mother) and Rogue's foster mother.

These include Graydon Creed (son of Mystique) and some members of the Trask family (whose DNA was copied by Xavier's sister Cassandra Nova). This would add robots (including the Sentinels) to the mix, as well as Warlock's son Torgo.

</li></ul></li><li> In Marvel Comics, the Olympian gods are just as twisted as their Mythological counter-parts, if not more so: The Elder Goddess Gaia is the sole "earth-mother goddess" of <em>all</em> of Earth's pantheons. She achieved this by, in different guises, mating with each pantheon's father god — even those who were her own descendants. This means that all of the different gods of different pantheons are related to each other through her; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> is Zeus's uncle (and grand-uncle).

The short version:
<ul><li> Prince Khufu of Egypt and his wife Chay-Ara are continually reincarnated. They become several familiar couples, including Brian Kent (himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBraveAndTheBold">possible ancestor of Jonathan Kent</a>) and Lady Penbrook, and Nighthawk and Cinnamon. In the 1940s, they become Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders, who become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> Hawkman and Hawkgirl. They get married and have a son, Hector, who grows up to be the Silver Scarab.
</li><li> Hector marries Lyta Trevor, <em>a.k.a.</em> the Fury, daughter of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> Fury and adopted daughter of Miss America (itself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>; Pre-Crisis Lyta was the daughter of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>). Then he dies and ends up in The Dreaming, taking on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">legacy</a> of Garret "The Sandman" Sanford. He takes Lyta there to live with him, but when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">the Lord of that realm</a> returns, he's banished to the afterlife and Lyta is sent back to Earth. Lyta then has a son, Daniel.
</li><li> Daniel, meanwhile, goes on to become <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the new Dream</span>, which makes him in some sense <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a sibling to the rest of the Endless</span>. This also makes him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Superman's spiritual uncle</span>.
</li><li> Shiera's cousin, Speed, has a granddaughter, Kendra, who tries to kill herself because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> that led to at least three different Hawkmen existing in the same continuity.

Meanwhile, Hector is reincarnated as the son of Dawn "Dove" Grainger and Hank "Hawk" Hall (no relation to any of the other Hawkmen running around), but he still thinks of Carter Hall as his father. Dawn's sister, Holly, became the new Hawk.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bat-Family</a> is a mild version of this (well, relative to other comics):
<ul><li> Bruce Wayne has four adopted children: his adopted sons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NightwingRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NightwingRebirth">Grayson</a>, Jason Todd, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Tim Drake</a> (the first three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robins</a>), and his adopted daughter Cassandra Cain (the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl</a>). Cassandra's biological parents are David Cain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyShiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyShiva">Lady Shiva</a>, two of the world's most infamous assassins and Bruce's former teachers.
</li><li> Bruce also has a number of biological children. His son Damian Wayne, the fifth Robin, is the child of Talia al Ghul, daughter of one of Batman's greatest enemies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a>. It's also revealed that Bruce has two further biological sons, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Terry</a> and Matt McGinnis</span>, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">genetic manipulation</a> and a surrogate father. In Earth-2 continuity, he has a biological daughter, Helena Wayne (<em>a.k.a.</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a>), the daughter of Selina Kyle.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">timeline</a>, Damian's counterpart Ibn al Xu'ffasch is romantically involved with Nightstar, who is herself the daughter of Dick Grayson and Starfire (which basically means she's dating her adoptive uncle).
</li><li> Not to be outdone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> claimed in one story that he was the son of Batman's confidante and adoptive mother figure, Dr. Leslie Thompkins. But the Joker's got an incredible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a>, so he's probably just making it up — but we can't be sure. And one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Anarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Anarky">Anarky</a></em> revealed that the title character was the Joker's son; this was originally planned to be just the Joker playing mind games with Anarky, but the series was cancelled before they could get there.
</li><li> And then there's the Kanes. Start with the five siblings: Nathan, Philip, Martha, Jacob, and Unknown. Nathan married a woman named Katherine Webb (Kathy Kane) who became the first Bat-Woman after his death, and was secretly a Spyral agent. She was the daughter of Otto Netz, the founder of Spyral. Philip didn't marry or have kids as far as is known. Martha married Thomas Wayne, see above. Jacob married a woman named Gabrielle and was the father of Katherine "Kate" Kane, the <em>second</em> Batwoman, and her twin sister Elizabeth, the criminal Alice, which is why Kate is Bruce Wayne's cousin. After Gabi's death, he married Catherine Hamilton, because there aren't enough versions of that name in the whole mess. And the unknown sibling is the parent of another Elizabeth: Bette Kane who may or may not have been her Aunt Kathy's sidekick Bat-Girl, but almost definitely had a solo career as Flamebird before teaming up with her cousin Kate as Plebe or Hawkfire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em>'s supporting character Tefe Holland is the daughter of Swamp Thing and Abby Arcane Holland. Tefe was originally a floating spirit called Sprout, who tried to find a body from a recently deceased person, was eventually given a body through Abby Holland's fetus, which was conceived through the Swamp Thing possessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">John Constantine</a> and having sex with her. Due to Constantine having the demon Nergal's blood in his veins at this time, Tefe is also part demon. She eventually became an Earth elemental like her father, beginning a line of human Earth elementals as a new Swamp Thing in Swamp Thing vol. 3, having all of her father's powers, but retaining a human appearance.
</li><li> The Harper Family:
<ul><li> James "Jim" Harper (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Guardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Guardian">Guardian</a> I) has been cloned a number of times and had his DNA used to create experimental subjects which makes his family tree confusing, and his guardianship/adoption of the original Newsboy Legion adds both the originals and <em>their</em> many clones to the mess. His most prominent clone has adopted his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a> as well as Jim I's grand-niece Bobby. Jim had three siblings, all of whom have decendants mixed in with the superhero crowd in the modern age including the aforementioned Bobby.
</li><li> His grand-nephew Roy Harper (Speedy/Red Arrow/Arsenal) had/will have a daughter named Lian with the super-villain Cheshire and was adopted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Oliver Queen</a> tying him to that family. He started out as Jim I's nephew but is now his grand-nephew due to a sliding timescale that required another generation be added in to the mix. Roy is also known to be descended from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a>, tying him to another large disfuntional family.
</li><li> Jamie Harper is pregnant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valor">Mon-El/Lar Gand</a>'s child, meaning that even without the Cadmus experiments their family was going to end up with some extraterrestrial DNA. She is Jim I's other grandneice, and spent time as a GCPD officer and the police contact for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin/Red Robin</a> before moving to Metropolis.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em> originally played fast and loose with mythology, with the Olympians that appeared being played more like powerful aliens that some people might worship. Later iterations imported the mess of the original mythological family ties of the Olympians from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> and added to it:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Golden Age</a> Diana was the daughter of Hippolyte and, depending on one's reading, Aphrodite as while Di only calls Hippolyte mom both women call Diana daughter and were the two who together brought about her birth. Aphrodite does not seem to be related to the other iterations of Olympians who appear in this continuity, but her relationship with Mars retains romantic overtones despite the fact that they've been fighting for thousands of years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Post-Crisis</a> on Hippolyta is confirmed to be Ares' daughter as in mythology, making Diana Ares' granddaughter, and Zeus' great-granddaughter. This means that Diana is the grand-niece of the much younger Cassie Sandsmark, illegitimate daughter of Zeus, who is Diana's sidekick as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a>. Diana's family ties to the Olympians get brought up very rarely, with Ares only pointing it out when she asks why he's gone out of his way to save her life, but Cassie has these ties thrown in her face constantly and doesn't appreciate it. The Olympians have a habit of addressing each other by relationship, for instance Zeus calling Hera his sister-wife, which highlights the mess of their incestuous family tree.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011">The New 52</a> further complicated matters by revealing Diana was Zeus's daughter rather than the daughter of Hippolyta and Aphrodite/five goddesses as she had been in previous iterations. Cassie was eventually revealed to be the daughter of one of Zeus' other illegitimate children. This was all retconned to have been false implanted memories by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth">Wonder Woman (Rebirth)</a></em>, until Robinson treated Zeus as Diana's father and muddled the continuity. Rebirth is also the first mainstream DC continuity to treat Aphrodite as Zeus' daughter.

<ul><li> On top of all that, even the relationships between established characters can vary from country to country and era to era. For a while in Italian comics it was taken for granted that Scrooge and Grandma Duck were brother and sister (even though this doesn't technically make sense — given that they're supposed to be Donald's uncle and grandmother respectively, they must be at least a generation apart). Meanwhile American comics have traditionally held that they're not even related except by marriage.
</li></ul></li><li> The genealogy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> is a nightmare, thanks to the elves' millennia-long lifespans, promiscuous mating habits, and tendency to forget who their relatives are after a few centuries or so. Almost every named character in the comic's 30-year run (to date) can be linked to every other named character through a complex chain of offspring, siblings, and significant others. Family trees turn out to be <em>even more complicated</em> than the books would suggest. Particularly Rain's primary family tree, which includes <em>main</em> characters Pike, Rainsong, Mender, Wing, Newstar, Kimo and Sust, and about twice as many <em>secondary</em> characters.

In an attempt to keep the family alive, inbreeding might have happened.

<ul><li> True to its comic book roots, the Petrelli family tree on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> is like this. It started with mom Angela, sons Peter and Nathan, and Nathan's wife and sons. Then Claire is also revealed to be part of the Petrelli family as Nathan's daughter, tying in Claire's adopted family, the Bennets, and her biological mother Meredith. It is later revealed Meredith has a brother, Flint, and Angela has a long-lost sister, Alice.
<ul><li> For a while, it was teased that Sylar was a third Petrelli brother, but this turned out to be a big fat lie. But Sylar has his own problems, as his relationships with his parents and their siblings are kind of screwed up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he joined the Petrelli tree for real by becoming Nathan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a>. However, the brainwashing and mindrape eventually wore off mid-way through season four.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Soap Operas are notorious for this trope, to give a few examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em> - Bianca's first child is the result of rape by Zach's brother. Her second is the result of artificial insemination using Zack's sperm. Zach is/was married to Kendall, Bianca's sister, and they have a child. Kendall also had a child by Ryan who one donated sperm and was suspected to be the father of Bianca's second child, but was actually the father of another child entirely.
<ul><li> What it boils down to is that Miranda, the elder daughter of Bianca and Gabrielle, the younger daughter are half-sisters as well as first cousins. Sharing the same mother, but their fathers are brothers. Gabrielle and Ian, Zack and Kendall's son are first cousins and half-brother and sister. Sharing the same father, but their mothers are sisters. Miranda and Ian are double first cousins since their fathers are brothers and mothers are sisters. Making this even more complicated is that Kendall and Bianca are half-sisters also, sharing the same mother in Erica Kane meaning that Gabrielle and Miranda only share one grandparent with Ian.
</li><li> That doesn't even cover the half of it. Let's just consider the Chandler family for a moment. Adam Chandler has been married <em>thirteen times</em>, and had two affairs. Between those marriages he had five children (Hayley, J.R, Anna, Colby, and Miguel) and raised Skye as his own before discovering they weren't related. And he adopted his nephew Scott. J.R had an affair with Annie (wife #13) to break them up, and now they've fallen in love. But Annie is engaged to Scott, and used to be married to Ryan, who she had a daughter Emma with. Ryan was engaged to Greenlee (who's also Emma's godmother), but she died and then came back and married David out of spite because Ryan had started a relationship with Madison. He also had a child with Kendall, Erica's daughter (and by the way, Erica married Greenlee's dad Jackson). But wait! Because Erica's been married just as many times (including to Adam) and almost fell in love with Caleb, who's the nephew to Palmer Cortland. And his ex-wife had an affair with Adam. Plus there's the situation with Tad. He lives in a house with two daughters, each from different previous marriages, has a grown up son who was also from a previous marriage, adopted Damon (who turned out to be his biological son anyways) and had a fling with Liza, who's Colby's mother, who's dating Damon. And then there's the fact Liza's mother married Adam's twin brother while Adam and she were married. It's like one giant loop-de-loop!

Holden and Lily then become a supercouple and the family tree only gets more complicated from there.

In the beginning, Martín was the son of Loli Falsini and Pablo Catáneo, and everybody was happy. Then the telenovela began, and Loli realized that Martín's true father was Andy Goddzer, who had a one-night relation with her during the high-school graduation night in 1989. It was confirmed with a DNA test. This gave Martin a whole new family, and a total of 2 parents and 3 grandparents. Pablo has a brother, Augusto. Clemente Falsini, Loli's parent, got married with the younger Patricia, who in fact attended high school with Loli. And then... Pablo and Patricia had a secret romance, and Pablo left Patricia pregnant, but they told everybody that it was Clemente's son.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>: Among the usual twists and turns, Jessica Buchanan is related to CJ and Sarah Roberts through both their father Cord (she is Cord's half-sister, making her their half-aunt) and their mother Tina (who is <em>her</em> half-aunt, making them her half-cousins as well).
<ul><li> Oh its a lot more complicated than just that. Originally within the show, Jessica was believed to be the only biological child of series heroine Viki Lord and her then-husband Clint Buchanan. When she was a teenager a woman named Natalie Balsom came to town as she grew up believing that she was the daughter of Roxy Balsom and her husband Walter and the older sister to their son Rex. She revealed that she and Jessica had been switched at birth and SHE was Viki and Clint's daughter. Of course, later on it was revealed that they BOTH were half-twins as Jessica was conceived when Viki was raped by series villain Mitch Laurence and Natalie was the biological daughter of Clint and Viki. Then the story gets even MORE twisted as it is revealed that Rex was was the result of a one-night-stand that Roxy had with Mitch, making him Jessica's biological half-brother. Before people can come to terms with that, it is THEN revealed that Rex was taken from his biological mother and switched with another baby Schuyler Joplin making HIM Jessica's half-brother instead. Rex was revealed to be the product of an affair that Clint had with Echo <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiSavoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiSavoy">Di Savoy</a> making him Natalie's biological half-brother after all though at first everybody thought that Viki's husband at the time Charlie was his father. By the end of the show, it was revealed that Mitch WASN'T Jessica's father after all making Jessica and Natalie full siblings and Rex their half-brother.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> has some issues with this as well. Considering that the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">treats siring like family</a>, you have The Master siring Darla, Darla siring Angel, Angel siring Drusilla, and Drusilla siring Spike. Then Angel killed Darla, who was brought back to life as a human. Then Drusilla sired Darla again, making her—as Dru puts it—both Darla's granddaughter and mother. By extension, this makes Darla Angel's mother and granddaughter and Spike her brother and great-grandchild. Then Angel and Darla screw like bunnies, defy the laws of the natural universe and conceive Connor, Angel's son, who, by the whole siring thing, is also Angel's brother and great-grandson. Then Connor sleeps with Cordelia (who Angel is in love with) and conceives Jasmine, Angel's completely evil granddaughter/niece/great-great-granddaughter. And this isn't taking into account that Angel probably sired even more vampires than Dru and Spike, including Penn from the episode "Somnabulist" and, possibly, James and Elizabeth from "Heartthrob". So, theoretically, any on-screen vampire younger than Angel is theoretically "related" to him. Plus, there's the fact that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy Season 7</a> Spike sired a whole bunch of vamps under the First's control, who may have sired others. Angel also sired at least two other vamps in his past, who may have turned others as well.
<ul><li> Cordelia also had at least one other pregnancy that didn't go to term (a good thing, since it would have killed her in being born). And considering Buffy's romantic involvements with both Angel and Spike, it's something of a relief that Buffy Summers and Scott Summers aren't related...

Plus, Wish!Hook's Alice gets engaged to Zelena's daughter Robin. Also, Emma and Hook have a daughter named Hope, Henry's baby half-sister.

Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella are Cersei's and Jaime's sons/daughter and nephews/niece, Tyrion's double nephews/niece, Tywin's double grandsons/granddaughter, and each others' brother/sister and cousin... and it only gets more complicated when marriages are arranged with the Tyrells. Lady Olenna Tyrell gives a speech about the complications of these arranged marriages. Her granddaughter Margaery is getting married to the current (inbred) king, Joffrey, and her grandson Loras is betrothed to the king's mother, which would make him the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. Cersei will be Joffrey's mother (as well as aunt) and sister-in-law, though this depends on definition. A lot of people nowadays don't count the spouses of your siblings-in-law as additional siblings-in-law, but in this society they seemingly do. Loras will be Margaery's brother and father-in-law. Then she goes on to explain how any children would fit in, specifically that Margaery's and Joffrey's son will be Loras's nephew and step-grandson. Furthermore, Tywin's marriage to his first cousin Joanna makes him both father and cousin to Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion. Later, Tommen was married to the same woman as Joffrey.

The family tree, which involves four families (Nielens, Kahnwalds, Dopplers, Tiedermanns) intertwined across three generations, gets progressively more tangled with each season.
<ul><li> To begin with, Season 1 reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the protagonist Jonas Kahnwald's father, Michael Kahnwald, is in fact Mikkel Nielsen, who traveled back in time over thirty years and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInThePast">Trapped in the Past</a>. The problem? Mikkel is the sibling of Martha Nielsen, Jonas' ex, which means that he's unwittingly been in an incestuous relationship with his <em>aunt</em>. Also, Mikkel/Michael's wife Hannah is having an affair with Ulrich Nielsen, who unknown to both of them is her <em>father-in-law</em>.</span>
</li><li> Then in Season 2, we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Noah, a character who previously seemed to be separate from the four families, is the brother of Agnes Nielsen - tying him in with the Nielsen family. Noah is also revealed to be the father of Charlotte Doppler - which ties the Nielsen and Doppler families together. To make matters even more complicated - turns our that Charlotte's mother is in fact Elizabeth Doppler... who's also her <em>daughter</em>, resulting in a convoluted case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyOwnGrampa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyOwnGrampa">My Own Grampa</a>.</span>
</li><li> By Season 3, this is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jonas and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> Martha conceive a child who in turn has a child with Agnes Nielsen in <em>both</em> realities - starting the Nielsen line. This means that the entire Nielsen family, including Jonas, is part of a causal loop with no beginning or end. Moreover, Jonas is revealed to have a half-sister named Silja (the product of an affair between his mother Hannah and Egon Tiedermann), who eventually marries Bartosz Tiedermann. Their children - Agnes and Noah. This ties together the Nielsen, Tiedermann and Doppler families by blood (the Kahnwalds as well, through Mikkel/Michael's adoption by Ines Kahnwald).</span>
</li><li> The convoluted nature of the show's family tree <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becomes a plot point in Season 3, with opposing characters trying to uphold or destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> that holds it all together, in order to either preserve their family lines or spare their families from the misery of their existence. This is indeed what fuels the central conflict of the series.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> that deals with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of the FLDS, a family tree diagram found in a suspect's trailer is so convoluted (due to the massive number of marriages each man has, as well as the prevelance of incest within the cult) that Charlie and Amita don't even recognize it as being a family tree, and Millie initially mistakes it for a cattle-breeding chart (which is close enough to "family tree" for Charlie and Amita to finally realize what it actually is).
<div class="indent"><strong>Millie:</strong> (<em>following a particular line</em>) For example, this guy married his brother's third wife's second daughter. Ugh!

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Mythology and Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Pretty much every named character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> can be placed somewhere on one massive and convoluted family tree. This is partly because the "long-running continuity" we're talking about here stretched over centuries of oral tradition and scores of different storytellers, and partly because... well... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Zeus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">slept around</a> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">a lot</a></strong>, including his sisters. Seriously, on any given family tree he's everyone's ancestor in at least two different places.
<ul><li> It really doesn't help that the Olympian gods, who via traditional and less-than-traditional means birthed the majority of the gods, were children of the Titans, who were themselves the children of Gaia and Ouranos (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">see a pattern</a>?), and that Zeus was far from the only one who considered monogamy beneath him.
<ul><li> Things got off to a great start as Ouranos already was Gaia's son - she gave birth to him unassisted by any male - so 'his' children, the Titans, the Furies, the Gigantes, the Hekatonchieres, the Cyclopes etc., were also his siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> Family trees became especially convoluted due to Zeus' recurring habit of sleeping with descendants of his — for instance, he fathered the little-known god Zagreus with Persephone, his daughter by his sister Demeter, and Herakles with Alcmene, the granddaughter of his son Perseus. To add extra complications, there were several instances of mortal women having children by both their divine lover and mortal husband, often as fraternal twins (in at least one case one mother was simultaneously pregnant by Hermes and Apollo in this way), although in one case, it happened with a single child (Theseus, who was the son both of the god Poseidon and the mortal King of Athens Aegus, whom his mother Aethra had bedded in the same night). The most well known example is Leda, whose children were Castor and Clytaimnestra (fathered by her husband Tyndareus) and Polydeuces and Helen (fathered by Zeus) (Yes, all at once. Leda laid two eggs, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Zeus had mated with her in the form of a swan</a>).
<ul><li> And then there were some complicated relationships brought about by the trope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Pair the Spares</a>. For instance according to an Italian tradition, after Odysseus (Ulysses to the Italians) was killed by Telegonus, his son by Circe, Circe granted immortality to Ulysses' widow Penelope and her son Telemachus. Circe married Telemachus and Penelope Telegonus, having sons called Italus and Latinus respectively. So Circe and Penelope both became each other's mother and daughter-in-law, and Telemachus and Telegonus each got a nephew who was also their half-brother.
</li></ul></li><li> Every mythological hero, and everybody who fought at Troy, needed to have the dignity of coming from a line descended from the gods, and so pretty much every mortal lineage was shoehorned into the Olympian clan by some author (or by multiple authors, using different genealogies, for added confusion!) Then there's the ancient Greek habit of marrying one's nieces...
<ul><li> Authors also disagree about the genealogy of some of the deities, for instance according to Hesiod Aphrodite was born from the foam spilled from Ouranos' cut-off genitals (making her Zeus' aunt), while according to Homer she is the daughter of Zeus and the minor earth-goddess Dione<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7oy39');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7oy39" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7oy39');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who may or may not have been a regional alias of Zeus' mother, Rhea</span>. According to some traditions Hephaistos is a son of Zeus and Hera, while according to Hesiod Hera had him without a sperm-donor. According to the most popular myth, Eros is the son of Aphrodite and Ares, another son of Zeus, but Hesiod's "Theogony" makes him one of the oldest of gods, a brother of Gaia brought forth by Chaos.
</li></ul></li><li> To make things even worse, the genealogies don't always make sense. For example, Perseus was the great-great-great-great grandson of Belus, whose granddaughter was Andromeda, the <em>wife</em> of Perseus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Any</em> mythology that includes a distinct pantheon can fall into this trope harder than... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">something really heavy</a>. For a single example, see Loki (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>) and his various children, of some of whom he is the father and others the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">mother</a></em>.
</li><li> In the modern religion of Wicca, even limiting the pantheon to only two deities does not stop the Tangled Family Tree from cropping up. According to the generally-accepted "Wheel of the Year" symbology, the God is his own father, by the Goddess, who is also his <em>sister.</em> If you want to keep yourself up for the next few nights, try working out all the relationships that imples—or worse, try to figure out where the God would get his heavenly genes from!
</li><li> How about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>? Arthur is the son of Uther and Ygraine, and Ygraine's children from her first husband are Morgause (wife of Lot and mother of Gawaine and his brothers, including Mordred, who may or may not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Arthur's son</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Morgan/Morganna/Morgaine La Fay</a> (wife of Urien and mother of Yvain/Owain, who marries Laudine, who's the ex-wife of one of several Red Knights), and Elaine of Garlot (who is the mother of Elaine the Younger). But Ygraine's first husband was the Duke of Cornwall, which implies some sort of relationship between this family and Mark, who's the Duke of Cornwall when Arthur is king, and is the uncle of Tristram. And then there's Constantine of Cornwall, who succeeds Arthur as King, and is the son of a <em>different</em> Duke of Cornwall, Cador, who is Arthur's half-brother or cousin and who also raised Arthur's wife Guinevere as his ward. (And who may or may not be the same as Cador the father of Kay's wife Andrivete, or Cador the brother of Caradoc the Younger's wife Guinier, both Arthur's knights and the former his foster-brother.) Meanwhile, Lancelot is the son of King Ban and his wife Elaine of Benoic, is raised by the Lady of the Lake (who could be the one who gave Arthur Excalibur, the one who had a relationship with Merlin, or both), is loved by a woman named Elaine of Astolat, and fathers Galahad on Elaine of Carbonek, who's the daughter of the Fisher King, who's the brother of King Pellinore (Percival's father or uncle, and the father of Elaine of Listenoise), whose son Lamorak goes on to have an affair with ... Morgause. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ArthurKingOfTimeAndSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ArthurKingOfTimeAndSpace">Arthur, King of Time and Space</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> how confusing this gets <a class="urllink" href="http://www.arthurkingoftimeandspace.com/0806.htm">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>. Some people have literally spent decades trying to wrap their heads around that mess.
<ul><li> The Gospels of Matthew and Luke each give a genealogy for Joseph (who is Jesus' stepfather, no biological relation at all, but never mind that...) reaching back through King David. However, Matthew claims the descent was through David and then Solomon, while Luke traces it through another son of David, Nathan. Matthew only traces the descent back to Abraham, but Luke goes all the way back to Adam - who, in some translations, is listed as the son of God, which would make him the (half-?)brother of Jesus.
<ul><li> The Solomon/Nathan issue can be somewhat sorted out if one was a maternal ancestor before swinging back into the main paternal line. The Bible counts some of the maternal ancestors as important as their paternal counterparts.
</li></ul></li><li> Note that Matthew and Luke already disagree about the names of Joseph's father, paternal grandfather, and his father - Matthew names them as Jacob, Matthan and Eleazar, Luke as Eli, Matthat and Levi.
</li><li> Adam is technically Christ's ancestor, and depending on your religion, his son, since Christ, being the Son of God, is also God in his own right, again, depending upon which religion you follow. So Adam could be Christ's great x10000 grandfather and his son and half-brother all at once. But that's a bit of a stretch on the norm...
</li><li> Made worse when you realize that he had to be a <em>biological</em> heir via <em>Mary</em> to fulfill the prophecy, and also a <em>legal</em> heir under Jewish law to be legitimate. The biology alone is tangled, but the fact that it had to conform to Jewish inheritance law made things even more complicated.
<ul><li> The 'mess' might be less of one if you consider that the genetics involving Jesus works on two levels, one pertaining to his God-heritage and one to his human heritage. Note also that Adam was a creation of God's (with Jesus present, just unmentioned), and so was not God's son on quite the same level as Jesus. As a final note, the Davidic genealogies might be divided such that Joseph comes from the line of Solomon and Mary from the line of Nathan through Eli, making Joseph Eli's son-in-law.

A dead Sim, Glarn Curious, was originally married to Glabe Curious (another theory is that she is his sister). He was abducted by aliens and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">impregnated</a> by Pollination Technician 9. After giving birth to twins, Glarn left Glabe and married Kitty Hogleg. They had four kids, and the oldest (Jenny) ended up marrying and having children with Pollination Technician 9 when he crash landed on Earth...
<ul><li> It gets worse with the sequels. In <em>The Sims 2</em> for PSP, Jenny and the Curious brothers get a new cousin out of nowhere named Sinjin Balani and Pascal Curious gave birth to his alien child, Tycho. In <em>The Sims 3: Ambitions</em>, the family tree is expanded again with Notzo Curious and Zo Curious' parents being revealed. There's a theory that Sinjin Balani may be the grandson of Notzo's sister (also introduced in The Sims 3), Bunny Curious, but nothing is officially confirmed. <a class="urllink" href="http://sims.wikia.com/wiki/Curious_family#Family_tree">Here is the family tree for those interested<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Thanks to Story Progression, it can even happen randomly to players. The mechanic will pair up any sims Young Adult or older as long as they're not directly related. Since the game is only able to keep track of so many relationship taboos, which often leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">second cousin marriages</a> and the like. Sims can also marry their ex-aunts and uncles (since the game only counts them as related if they're married to a relative) and become their cousins' step-parent. Their new child will be the cousin/stepchild's half-sibling. To further convolute things, the cousin/stepchild can go on to marry the step-parent/cousins nephew or niece. To complete the circle of fuckery, their child can marry and have kids with the ghost of one of their ancestors. Does your head hurt yet?
</li><li> What makes this even worse is that, thanks to mods, you can even make Sims have children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">with their siblings</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">or</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">their parents</a>.

Aside of Master Xehanort, Young Xehanort, Xemnas, and Ansem, Xigbar and Saïx (and not their original personas, Braig and Isa, strangely enough) are revealed to be Xehanorts as well, having been infused with a part of Master Xehanort's heart and gradually turning <em>into</em> Xehanort (slowly adopting features of his such as golden eyes and pointed ears). Additionally, the plan was to turn <em>Sora</em> into the final member of this group (luckily, it was thwarted by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment from Lea, Axel's original identity), and the original plan for the first Organization XIII was to use the other Nobodies as vessels for Xehanort's heart.</span>

Then, because Sothis merged with Byleth into a single being, that would make our protagonist their own great-grandmother, "mother" to their grandmother Rhea and "grandmother" to their parents, Jeralt and Sitri. And if you believe that Sitri is a clone of Sothis and not just Rhea's child, then Byleth can also be counted as Rhea's sibling and their parents' uncle/aunt</span>.
<ul><li> In addition to the above, all crest-bearers are descended from the 10 Elites and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the nature of dragon blood in this setting, those 10 warriors are related to the dragons whose blood they consumed</span>.

Molly shares a tiny bit of genetic material with Bob's girlfriend Jean, making Jean her biological mother "just a little bit." Molly lived for a time with Jean's Uncle Cestus Poole, whom Molly addresses as Uncle Cess. Molly built a sentient robot named Roofus, who regards her as his mother, which makes Bob and Jean his grandparents. Roofus now lives on another planet, being raised by Bob's alien friend Voluptua, whom Molly addresses as "Auntie Voluptua." Molly also has a genetically identical cloned "sister" named Galatea, grown by Dean Martin (no, no <em>that</em> Dean Martin), who is her de facto father. She is also Jean's biological daughter "just a little bit" just as Molly is. Galatea addresses Bob as "Uncle." Molly regards Roofus as Galatea's nephew.
<ul><li> Molly now also has a <em>second</em> clone sister named Djali ("Jolly"), short for Djaliana, who was grown by Galatea. Jolly looks like her sisters except for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">a couple of hundred feet tall.</a> Despite being grown by Galatea, she still considers Jean her mother.

But the growing family tree was explicitly pointed out prior to any major revelation about the rabbit's side of things. At that point there was Kevin (the rabbit) and his wife Kell (the wolf), each of whom had a kid from a previous marriage, plus Kell's brother Ralph who got married to Martha and turned out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the father of Corrie</span>, not to mention some budding romances and cloning going around, and... maybe you should <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kevinandkell.com/2002/kk0526.html">look for yourself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Jessica's family is apparently two families that "got Brady-Bunched" in three different places, making her related to several people multiple times. Janel, on the other hand, has a grandmother who was adopted after the family lost a daughter and decided to simply replace her with their servants' child who was around the same age.
</li><li> The Bright family from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a></em> is complicated. Even by SCP standards. One of the five main siblings, TJ, hasnt physically aged since he was 16 and has a daughter whos a fully grown adult. Pretty much all spouses of the family members are only vaguely mentioned in passing on account of the fact that they dont have Bright blood, with the exception being Adam and Evelyn (which, yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest">means what you think it means</a>). The family also holds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual">very little standards in concern to sexual partners</a>, resulting in there being dozens of bastard children all over the place. One of whom eventually leads to Joey Tamlin, who travels back in time and kickstarts the whole bloodline. Also, one of them is green. No, not a guy with green skin. The actual color green. Theres a reason the family often uses the term family wreath instead of family tree.

Given that nearly the entire current generation is made up of people with deformities and/or missing limbs, it is understandably messed up, but the fact that some of the family members were in Hiroshima around the time of the A-Bomb's detonation, and were originally traced back to carny folk is quickly eclipsed by the presence of uncle Kiki, A MONKEY.

</li><li> It should also be noted that in one episode, when Tom Tucker was dating Peter's mother Thelma, he was technically Peter's stepfather (which made his son, Jake, Peter's stepbrother). Another episode saw Tricia Takanawa as the stepmother of Lois, her sister Carol, and her brother Patrick during the brief time she dated Carter Pewterschmidt.

Brian married and later divorced Lois in "The Perfect Castaway," which temporarily made him the stepfather of Meg, Chris, and Stewie; this also made Dylan their stepbrother.

<ul><li> The family tree of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of the early Roman Empire is just about the closest thing to a real life Tangled Family Tree as you're going to find, as many very confused first-time viewers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em> have discovered. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_family_tree">Here's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a rendering of that family tree. (Some people have discovered that having a copy of the Julio-Claudian family tree at one's side greatly helps a viewer grasp who's who and what's what while watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em>. Others avoid looking at the family tree at all, as it contains spoilers.)
<ul><li> For example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a> Caesar's paternal grandfather, Drusus, was the son of Augustus's second wife Livia by her first marriage. His paternal grandmother, Antonia, was the daughter of Mark Antony and Augustus's sister Octavia. His maternal grandmother was Augustus's daughter of his first marriage, Julia, who married Augustus's friend, General Agrippa.

</li><li> Also not helped by the Romans' love of adopting nephews as sons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">sleeping around as much as the Gods</a>, and giving all of their daughters the same name.
</li></ul></li><li> The Julio-Claudians were pikers compared to a lot of European dynasties a few hundred years ago. The number of times people married their first cousins to reaffirm long-standing alliances or some such was absolutely unbelievable. Even in the modern day, it still happens - Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are both second cousins once removed and third cousins via different paths.
<ul><li> The worst example historically is probably <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_XII_of_Spain">Alfonso XII of Spain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> whose grandfathers were brothers who each married their own nieces.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note83m6r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note83m6r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note83m6r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> As the Wikipedia article notes, though, it is speculated that Alfonso XII's father was not his mother's husband/second cousin.</span> Instead of the usual 24 great- and great-great-grandparents, he had 10. Admittedly, that's not directly a Tangled Family Tree, but when it carries on for a while (and it did, for centuries) it can get ludicrously tangled.
</li><li> All that that is before you consider that these people were often all rulers in different nations. Just because he's your brother and your cousin doesn't mean that you can't go to war with him, right? Which makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar">Thirty Years' War</a> (aka, the bloodiest European war pre-WWI) the second-biggest family feud of all time.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_segundo80.png">family tree<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain">Charles II of Spain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is also incredibly tangled. In case you don't want to work it out, that means a grand total of <em>eight</em> separate genomes introduced over the course of seven generations and at least three cases of men marrying their nieces. Not only that, but Joanna of Castile, a.k.a. "Crazy Jane", is most of his great^5 and 6 grandmothers, when it'd be normal to have 16 and 32, respectively. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">Hence him being a literal deformed moron</a>, hence him being unable to produce children (they actually tried, with two wives that were "merely" second cousins, but the man was literally too malformed to breed), hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>, hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheSpanishSuccession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheSpanishSuccession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, or the <em>third</em>-biggest family feud of all time. <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> of France and Leopold I of Austria both had claims to the Spanish throne through Charles II's grandfather, by way of their mothers and their wives. Problem was, one had a mother who was the other's mother's older sister, the other had a wife who was the other's wife's older sister, and nobody could figure out which trumped which. When the third candidate (six year old <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ferdinand_of_Bavaria,_Prince_of_Asturias">Joseph Ferdinand/José Fernando of Bavaria<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) died, the French king moved to have his grandson crowned, and the Austrian emperor moved to have his son crowned. The rest of Europe was terrified of either power gaining control of the Spanish empire, and moved to stop them both. Hence, The War Of Spanish Succession.
<ul><li> Philip of Castille<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9ipv0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9ipv0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9ipv0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(died 1506)</span> and Joanna of Castille<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10txq0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10txq0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10txq0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(died 1555)</span> together were <em>both</em> 3x-Great grandparents <em>and</em> 5x-Great-grandparents to Charles II, and provided about 40.6% of his<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11mnjb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11mnjb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11mnjb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(born 1661)</span> genes. That shouldn't work! And frankly didn't!
</li><li> Charles II also had <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis,_congenital">congenital syphilis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (his father was infected through sex with prostitutes, then transmitted it to his wife, who in turn passed the disease on to her unborn son), which is known to cause severe birth defects and genetic mutation. This may well have been the first <em>new</em> genetic information introduced in generations. Think of it as adding a little raw sewage to a gene pool filled with stagnant swamp water.
</li></ul></li><li> And Charles II is just the most severe case in his dynasty. Pick a Habsburg. <em>Any</em> Habsburg. There's a reason there's a Wikipedia article on the Habsburg chin. The Habsburg case is one of wanting to keep it "all in the family." Unlike many of Europe's dynasties, they came by the vast majority of their titles through lucky inheritances (having come to power after the black plague devastated most of the noble houses of Europe) rather than war, and they didn't want to lose any of them the same way they had earned them. As has been noted, this ultimately produced a literal genetic recipe for disaster. The Habsburg Chin (or Lip) went from a family trait of a larger than normal lower jaw to a facial deformity so severe that Charles II could barely speak and couldn't chew.
</li><li> You would think that if you had a grandmother called Juana The Mad you would know better than to marry your double first cousin and later your own niece (daughter of your sister by another first cousin!) but not if you are Philip II of Spain. And that of course was why Philip was the LAST sane and intelligent King of the Spanish Habsburg line.
<ul><li> His <em>daughters</em> by the French Elisabeth de Valois were beautiful, sane and highly intelligent - in contrast to the two sons he bred with the above mentioned cousin and niece. But did he notice and draw the obvious lesson? Heck no!

<ul><li> According to recent DNA studies, Tut was the offspring of a full brother/sister marriage, with said brother and sister being children of Amenhotep III and his non-royal wife Tiye. Ironically, this suggests that exogamy may have actually been the source of his problems, as the antecedent Thutmossids' only genetic problem seemed to have been a bad overbite.
</li><li> The 12th Dynasty seemed to consistently practice brother/sister marriage, and it lasted nearly two hundred years, producing seven extremely able and successful kings and finally ending due to a dearth of male heirs. It all depends on how sound the genetic inheritance is to start with.

This tangled web is not at all helped by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingBobTheNth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingBobTheNth">all the principal players shared only about four names and have to be distinguished by Roman numeral</a>. <br/><br/>If Mark Antony had won the war, it would have gotten a lot worse. For example, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donations_of_Alexandria">Donations of Alexandria<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> would have divided the Roman holdings in the Eastern Mediterranean (and parts of Armenia and Persia conquered by Mark Antony in the name of Egypt) into various kingdoms, each with one of Mark and Cleo's children as King or Queen. In Alexandria, Cleo would have been crowned "High Queen and Queen of Egypt". Her son by Caesar, Ptolemy Caesar (better known by his Latin nickname <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion">Ceasarion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, meaning "Little Caesar"), would be crowned "High King, King of Egypt, heir to Caesar (who was by that point raised to the status of living god), Dictator of Rome". You just <em>know</em> the various lesser kings and queens would get into all kinds of family feuds and incestuous marriages like later day European royalty. Potentially even Twincest since Alexander Helios (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Alexander Sun</a>) and Cleopatra Selene II (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Cleopatra Moon II</a>) were twins, and both included in the land grab. However it gets really interesting when you consider that the King and Queen of Egypt, traditionally ruled together, were related, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">married</a>. So Cleo's relationship record would've gone "Brother, other Brother, Caesar, Mark Antony, Son."
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> of Britain and Christian IX of Denmark had a lot of children that were married off to the royalty of Europe according to custom. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, every monarch in Europe, even the rulers of minor nations like Romania, and Greece, were the grandchild of Vicky on one side, and Chris on the other, making them both maternal and paternal cousins. (Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary being among the only exceptions, although the latter, as a Habsburg, had a tangled family tree of his own.) Both the Russian Tsar and the German Kaiser spoke English as their first language, and the Swiss press at the time called it "the cousins' war". Surreal.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tsar_Nicholas_II_%26_King_George_V.JPG">Here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> is a photo of British King George V, and his double cousin Tsar Nicholas II of Russia both wearing German military uniforms together in Berlin before the war. Good luck figuring out which is which. They look enough alike to be twins and have the same taste in facial hair.
</li><li> Even more surreal when you realise that through Imperialism, they controlled anywhere between 75% and 90% of the world's landmass, making them also the most successful family in human history.
</li><li> Despite the close relationships and often being in close communication, they quite frequently hated each other. To a substantial degree, World War One started because the English royals sneered down their noses at Kaiser Wilhelm, and he was desperate to be loved while also resenting them. Yes, World War One takes the title for "biggest family feud of all time," even if you discount the Americans and the French.
<ul><li> There was also the fact that Wilhelm really didn't grasp that his cousin George didn't control the British government. He was convinced that King George V wouldn't allow the dispute to come to war, not understanding that George didn't have a say in the matter.
</li></ul></li><li> And then there's the fact that Franz Joseph's great-great-grandfather was Charles III of Spain, and Victor Emmanuel's great-great-grandfather was brother to Franz Joseph's grandfather. For extra fun, the families of Christian IX and Victoria married several times; most notably, a Danish prince and his wife (Victoria's granddaughter), who became the first King and Queen of Norway.
</li></ul></li><li> The Rothschild banking family, said to be so rich they financed both sides of every war in the 19th century, practiced incestuous marriage, motivated by the fact that marrying outside the family would mean the family fortune would be split in between different lines through inheritance, dowries and the like. Several generations of Cousin/Cousin, and in one case, Uncle/Niece marriages followed. They have since abandoned this practice (doctor's orders). Also, they were right. The family fortune dried up after they stopped the incest.
<ul><li> Not only that, but one of the original branches of the family died out, and several descendant branches have been in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue">feuds with each other</a>. While still wealthy, the Rothschilds' fortunes suffered greatly in both world wars (with several members of the family perishing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">concentration camps</a>), and they are far less wealthy than they used to be.
</li></ul></li><li> Duke William of Normandy (also called William the Bastard, because he was illegitimate) invaded England and killed King Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon King. William was motivated by the fact that he was Edward the Confessor's cousin, and was supposedly promised it by Harold Godwinson on a stack of holy relics (Edward the Confessor was the King of England before Harold Godwinson for those paying attention). King Harold Godwinson's daughter married Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev (whose own mother was the daughter of Constantine IX Monomachus of Byzantium). The Russians, assisted by large numbers of Scandinavians, invaded Byzantium in 1043. Harald Hadrada ("the Ruthless"), who later became king of Norway, joined the Byzantine army with a large following of northmen ("Varanger"), campaigned widely, and ripped out the eyes of the Byzantine emperor Michael V Kalaphates in 1042. King Harald Hadrada of Norway invaded England in 1066, on the pretext that it was promised to his family by Harthacnut whose father was Cnut The Great, Viking King of Norway, Denmark, and England (also parts of Scotland, Sweden, Ireland, and Poland) from 1018-1035. Harthacnut's mother was also Emma of Normandy, William of Normandy's great aunt. Harald Hadrada was killed by King Harold Godwinson, who was himself killed by Duke William at the Battle of Hastings, thus ending the Saxon period, and leading to centuries of French rulers on the English throne. All at a time when most people never got further than 3 miles from their birthplace.
<ul><li> Prior to marrying Cnut, Emma had been wife to Aethelred the Unready, and bore him two sons. She was second wife to both men as well, meaning that at different points <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">the throne was contested by</a> sons of Aethelred and his first wife, sons of Aethelred and Emma, sons of Cnut and his first wife, and sons of Cnut and Emma. Not making the whole thing any less confusing was the fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Aethelred and Cnut's first wives both happened to be named Aelgifu</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12arf9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12arf9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12arf9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Emma herself was given the name 'Aelgifu' when she first came to England, but historians rarely use it when referring to her, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">obvious reasons</a>.</span>
</li><li> Speaking of the two Aelgifus, one oft-overlooked detail is that they too would be distant relatives through marriage, as Aelgifu of York's son with Aelthelred, Edmund Ironside, married a cousin of Aelgifu of Northampton named Ealdgyth. The reasons for this are complicated: when Sweyn Forkbeard first invaded England, he married his son Cnut to Aelgifu of Northampton to secure a political alliance with the Mercians. Seemingly behind this alliance were Sigeferth, husband of Aelgifu's cousin Ealdgyth, and his brother Morcar<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13cko9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13cko9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13cko9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Aelgifu's father Aelfhelm had been killed on Aethelred's orders, and her brothers Wulheah and Ufegeat blinded, so she had pretty good reason to go along with this</span>. Then when Sweyn died and Aethelred retook the country, Sigeferth and Morcar were executed and Ealdgyth imprisoned. However Aethelred's son Edmund then ran away with Ealdgyth and married her, securing her northern allies for himself. Meaning when Cnut re-invaded and he and Edmund fought for the English throne, they were both married to women of the same family, and after Cnut defeated Edmund and Edmund then died under mysterious circumstances, Cnut (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">possibly</a>) put aside Edmund's wife's cousin to marry his stepmother. <em>Yeah</em>.
</li><li> And that's before we get into the whole issue of what the legal status of Cnut and Aelgifu's relationship actually was. It's unclear if she had a lesser legal status than a wife, meaning Emma was his only legitimate wife, and her children his legal heirs, or if his marriage to Aelgifu was a full-fledged marriage, meaning his marriage to Emma would have been bigamous and hence, illegitimate. This is significant given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> that ensued between Aelgifu and Emma's respective sons by Cnut after his death.
</li></ul></li><li> Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord. Not only was he a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, but he had several literal bastards (probably including the artist Eugene Delacroix), most of them with a very unsure paternity. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Auguste_Louis_Joseph,_duc_de_Morny">Charles de Morny<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a politician, stated: "In our family, we are bastards from mother to son since three generations, I am a great-grand-son of a king, grand-son of a bishop, son of a queen and brother of an emperor". Specifically, he was great-grandson to King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXV">Louis XV</a> of France, whose illegitimate daughter Adelaide Filleul bore a son to Talleyrand, the bishop. Said son, Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, had an affair with Hortense de Beauharnais, stepdaughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> and Queen of the Netherlands, an affair which produced de Morny; de Beauharnais' legitimate son later became Emperor Napoleon III. And Charles de Morny himself had an illegitimate son: writer George Feydeau. Talleyrand's legitimate family was also quite complicated, his brothers and cousins breeding prodigiously. And Talleyrand's daughter married one of his cousins.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>'s Y-Chromosome is found in 0.5% of all men on earth. Makes for roughly 35,000,000 people. Guy got around.
</li><li> Some 30% of all Europeans descend from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, making for roughly 220,000,000 people descended from a total of ten legitimate and illegitimate children who survived, married, and procreated.
</li><li> Some scientists theorize that around the same time as humans first left Africa, we were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">on the brink of extinction</a> with fewer than 500 individuals making up the entire human race, all of them living along the straits of Aden. Sometime after making the crossing into Arabia, they would splinter into two groups. One group would return to Africa, the other would go on to colonize the rest of the world. They cite signs of a genetic bottle-neck in the human genome as evidence, geological evidence of expanding African deserts at around the same time as a cause, and fishing tools found in fossil reefs in the region from around this time gives them the place. Also of note, Mitochondrial Eve, the last common female ancestor of all humans lived around 150,000 B.C., whereas Y-Chromosome Adam, the last common male ancestor of all humans lived around 30,000 B.C..
<ul><li> It is a common misconception that Y-Chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve reproduced with each other, and were the only people around at the time, or were the only people around at the time with descendants in the present day. Y-Chromosome Adam is unique because he passed his genes down through an unbroken line of male offspring. Many of his male contemporaries also are ancestors of people living today, but through lines that contain daughters, so their Y-chromosomes were not passed on (although other genes of theirs certainly were). Similarly, Mitochondrial Eve is unique because she passed her genes down through an unbroken line of female offspring. Other women were alive when she lived, but somewhere in your ancestry between you and them is a male. There is no requirement that these two people reproduced with each other, or even lived at the same time, for this to be true.
<ul><li> It should further be noted that "Adam" and "Eve" are titles, not individuals. They refer only to the last common ancestor of every <em>living</em> human. If some isolated tribe in the Amazon or Indonesia was completely wiped out by a sudden natural disaster, "Eve" could suddenly switch to someone who lived 20,000 years later than the previous Eve.
</li></ul></li><li> Also of note, Y-Chromosome Adam lived around the same time as the "Great Leap Forward", the time when humans began developing more complex tools (bow and arrow, rafts and canoes, animal traps, etc), and making art for the first time. Therefore, it's entirely reasonable to suggest that Y-Chromosome Adam's line was more successful because they were more intelligent, and therefore either A: reacted better to dangerous situations then competing males (natural selection), or B: had more successful tribes that attracted more ladies and had more surviving children (social selection). Or both.
<ul><li> The biggest cause of the difference in time periods is simply because men can have dramatically more offspring than woman, even more so with Polygamy being much more common then Monogamy for much of human history.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Japan, with a caste system as strong as medieval Europe, is no exception. Until the marriage between who by the time was the Prince Akihito to Empress Michiko in 1958, for the past <em>millennium</em> members of the Japanese Imperial House can only marry another Imperial House member, a descendant of a Heian-era nobility, or, after the Meiji Restoration, the descendants of one of the former daimyos.
<ul><li> The Japanese Emperors have all been drawn from the same patrilineal dynasty (their claim to legitimacy has always been that the first emperor was the grandson of Amaterasu, the sun goddess.) There have however, been a few matrilineal dynasties. That is to say, the clan who had the most power ruled by having the Crown Prince marry the daughter of the most powerful man in that clan generation after generation, therefore ensuring that the next generation counts that clan as family, and is thus loyal to them. This goes on until the ruling clan gets overthrown by another clan. So first it's the Soga clan, then the Fujiwara, then the Taira, then the Minamoto...

This was prompted by her daughter asking Fisher if she was related to her boyfriend, a grandson of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethTaylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>.

</li><li> Inbreeding (and the related genetic hilarity that ensues) is a common riff in redneck humor, as noted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a>. Some examples:
<div class="indent">If your family tree does not fork, you might be a redneck.
</div><div class="indent">If you've ever gone to a family reunion to pick up women, you might be a redneck.
</div></li><li> Even without incest, there can be some seriously weird relations if certain people marry other certain people. For example, if you're a guy and you just married your long-time girlfriend (making her your wife), but your divorced mother just married your wife's father, that would make your wife also your (step)sister! And then if your older sister decided to marry your wife's uncle, he'd be your uncle too, but he'd also be your brother (in-law). It's almost the opposite of Jeff Foxworthy's "redneck jokes": Your family tree does fork, it just forks so dang much it resembles a bush more than a tree!

</li></ul></li><li> In some cultures where polygamy is legal, some husbands try to minimize strife between co-wives by marrying women who are sisters, hence used to getting along with one another. The co-wives' respective offspring are therefore each others' half-siblings and cousins at the same time. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, such individuals are called three-quarter siblings.
</li><li> In secluded societies, people were prone to marry close because it was easier that way. Before modern communication and roads, many remote areas in Norway had this problem; in the valley of Setesdal, certain inherital diseases spread because of this, and in nearby Telemark, some families were as tangled as any. In one case, a farmer married his cousin because she was close. One of his daughters married her second cousin, and so on. After getting all those details straight, one family member actually mused: "it is a wonder we didn`t end up morons all of us". The family tree in question <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orgelhuset.org/en/slekt.htm">looks something like this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and is only one example of many.

Roosevelt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> related, but Franklin happens to be the fifth cousin to his wife Eleanor's father. Furthermore, Eleanor happens to be the niece of Teddy Roosevelt. Let's just say that the Roosevelt family tree is complicated enough that they distinguish themselves as the Hyde Park branch (Franklin's side) and the Oyster Bay branch (Teddy's side). With Eleanor's marriage to Franklin serving as a bridge between the two. Here is the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_family">family tree<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In 2012, a California student named BridgeAnne D'Avignon completed a genealogical project that, by tracing both paternal and maternal lines, proved that almost every man to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidents">President of the United States</a> is a descendant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingJohnOfEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingJohnOfEngland">King John of England</a>. The only exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinVanBuren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinVanBuren">Martin Van Buren</a>, who is of Dutch ancestry instead. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> does descend from King John through his white mother. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, who obviously was not included in D'Avignon's project, turns out to be a distant cousin of Obama (again, through his white mom) and a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-are-related-genealogy/">19th cousin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, on top of being another King John descendant.
</li><li> While we're on the topic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-1001741/Match-heaven-Obama-related-Brad-Pitt-Clinton-cousins-Angelina-Jolie.html">she is a distant cousin of singers Madonna, Celine Dion and Alanis Morissette<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. To elaborate, she and Angelina Jolie are ninth cousins twice removed. Meanwhile, her rival during the 2008 presidential election, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>, is a distant cousin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>.
</li><li> The Kardashian family has enough drama to go around as is, but with the birth of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna's daughter Dream... well, we'll just let this guy <a class="urllink" href="http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/connections-tyga-blac-chyna-kardashians/1445914/">explain it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> To clarify: Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna have a daughter together named Dream. Dream's half-brother King Cairo is the son of Tyga, a rapper who used to date Dream's half-aunt Kylie Jenner while she was underage. Had Tyga and Kylie stayed together and gotten married, Kylie would've also been King Cairo's stepmother and Tyga would've been Dream's half-uncle, which would also make King Cairo Dream's cousin. (Kylie Jenner, by the way, has since moved on to Travis Scott and had a daughter with him named Stormi.)
<ul><li> Meanwhile, you have Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, who have four children overall. Kanye once dated Amber Rose, who went on to have Sebastian with her ex Wiz Khalifa.
</li><li> Khloe Kardashian has a daughter of her own named True, whose father is Khloe's ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson. The latter also has a son named Prince with another woman.
