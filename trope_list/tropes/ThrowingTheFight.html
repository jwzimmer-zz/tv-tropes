</div></div><p>Taking a dive. Fixing the match. Intentionally losing a sporting event, usually for monetary gain.

In that case, it's not uncommon to see the athlete back out of the deal, thus making them some powerful enemies (and sometimes not escaping them). In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, those who get caught doing this can suffer some serious repercussions, most notably during the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal">Black Sox scandal of 1919<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> Some matches have been thrown during the events of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade">Bakuten Shoot Beyblade</a></em> trilogy. The first is done by Rei in his match against Takao during the Japanese Tournament. Rei participated expecting no actual challenge and, indeed, he breezed through the tournament up until the second round against Takao. Takao beat him there. And needing nothing more than knowing there's still challenges for him out there, Rei walked away from the third round. The second thrown match was done by Steve, who had orders to stretch his battle against Takao during the American Finals so the PPB could gather data on him. Steve lost that match â€” it wasn't necessarily supposed to happen, but it did as a consequence of him holding back and the PPB were fine with it, because they wrongly expected they'd win the rest. And the third thrown match was Kai's doing when he went up against Daichi during the tag team round-robin in the third season. He shot Dranzer out of the stadium, giving the BBA Revolution one point by default. The reason? He had been expecting to go up against Takao, but the latter was put on the bench.
</li><li> Toya flat-out refuses to take a dive during a four-way Go match in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a></em>, even though he's up against a rich Assemblyman who absolutely hates to lose and will likely cut funding if he does. But he goes further than that: Toya ties all four games, just to hammer home the gap between them. As one might expect, he gets his ass chewed out by his superiors when they find out.
</li><li> During the Chunnin Exams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Gaara was threatened by Tsuba and Midori of Kusagakure to take a dive in his fight with Sasuke. He refused. And killed them.
</li><li> Malcolm Gedo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em> makes it a habit to throw fights, but not without asking his opponents for an substantial fee, which the opponents understandably see as an insult.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em> story features a boxer by the name of Inagaki who intimidates his opponents into throwing fights against him, with the ultimate aim of becoming champion. He murdered Shunichi Ogino, his only obstacle to the title match, after his girlfriend Megumi Iwasaki nursed him back to health following a hit-and-run that Inagaki was also behind. He then threatened to murder the daughter of the champion Mita if he didn't throw the fight, but is stopped by Ryo Saeba, who was hired to take out Inagaki by Megumi, and who ultimately kills him with a solid gold bullet fired into his ear canal at the exact moment that Mita's final punch connected.
</li><li> An involuntary variant is part of Ken's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">WeiÃŸ Kreuz</a></em> â€” he was a J-League goalie and was drugged without his knowledge to fix a game, then blamed for throwing it. His efforts at finding out who was responsible ultimately lead him to join Weiss.
</li><li> In a storyline in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> manga series, the assistant for a popular restaurant owner and chef requests to Sasami that she throw her match against the man's son, telling her that the man's been pressuring him to win three "Ferrous Chef" matches (think <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a></em>) and that this would be his third and the kid could finally be free. However, Sasami ends up refusing, saying that she wouldn't feel right if she didn't give her all. Others attempt to stop her in the process, but she ends up coming out on top. However, the boy's impressed with Sasami's cheerfulness over cooking and is determined to try again, impressing his father.
</li><li> This is one of the few ways Kyoko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion">3-gatsu no Lion</a></em> attempts to tarnish Rei's professional shogi career: telling him sob stories of his opponents in order to manipulate him into losing on purpose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a Season 1 episode, Kaiser Ryo chooses not to activate his facedown card to save himself from a direct attack by Camula, since Camula arranged things that if Ryo won, his little brother would lose his soul.
</li><li> In a Season 1 episode, the ancient pharaoh Abidos the Third had a reputation for being undefeated in duels, so the bad guys resurrect him and send him against the heroes. Judai gets the upper hand, and it is revealed that the reason why Abidos was undefeated was because everyone who faced him before lost on purpose because they were scared he would punish them if he lost. Abidos was mortified to learn this; he sincerely believed his victories had been a result of his own skill.
</li><li> In the first episode of Season 2, Edo Phoenix purposely loses to Judai after being told to by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Saiou</a>, using a makeshift deck made of forty cards from eight booster packs. Much later, after Edo has won once and lost once against Judai using his actual deck, Judai tells him the first time doesn't count, seeing as Edo let him win, which means they're even now. (Naturally, he's offering a "tie breaker" later, but they never get around to it.)
</li><li> In a Season 2 episode, Kenzan and Sho have a duel to determine which of them is a more worthy friend to Judai. At the end, Kenzan is about to lose, but can end the game in a draw if he uses his facedown card. He chooses not to play it after seeing Sho's devotion to Judai.
</li><li> Later in Season 2, Misawa loses to Manjyome on purpose, neglecting to use the Magic Cylinder Trap Card he set to win, as he feels the only way he can ever be important is by joining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Society Of Light</a>.
</li><li> Still later in Season 2, when Manjyome breaks free of Saiou's brainwashing during his duel with Judai, he uses a card that gives Judai control of his White Knight Lord and then destroys it, even though he loses the duel via its effect; his reason for this is simply to destroy the symbol of what was controlling him, the Knight.
</li><li> Moving on to season 4, in episode 165, a sleazy TV producer named Mike tells Manjoume to throw his duel against Judai, as he believes good ratings are more important than an honorable duel. When Judai finds out, he calls Manjoume out on throwing away his pride and Manjoume realizes how low he's sunk.
</li><li> In episode 166, Mike orders Edo Phoenix to throw his duel against Manjoume, threatening to close down an orphanage if he doesn't. Fortunately, Judai exposes Mike's treachery and gets him arrested, allowing the two to finish the duel fairly.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX">manga version of GX</a>, Reggie MacKenzie neglects to activate her set Mirror Force card (or use her Swords of Revealing Light or even defend with her Seraphim Blaster) during her duel with Misawa during the tournament, which would have prevented his direct attack with Red Ogre which caused her to lose. (While it seems out-of-character for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">someone like Reggie</a> to be nice to him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">her reason is she simply thinks the tournament is a waste of time</a>, so she bails on it.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rudger duels Yusei with their lives on the line. When Rudger realizes he may actually be in danger of losing, he flees, but forces Yusei's friend Rally to take his place, with the same stakes. Not wanting to hurt Yusei, Rally loses on purpose.
</li><li> Rex Godwin throws the duel against his Dark Signer brother Rudger, despite having been able to win with three very powerful Trap Cards (Solemn Judgment, Divine Wrath, and Mirror Force) that he doesn't set. His reasons are that he wanted to be converted into the Dark Signers (the penalty for losing) to gain power and the ability to break the vicious cycle the conflict had caused. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">(In his mind, anyway.)</a>
</li><li> In their first duel, Dark Glass intentionally protects his monster by allowing Yusei to attack him directly instead, losing as a result. He likely did it because he knew the villains were watching and did not want them to see all his cards and strategies.
</li><li> Minor example, Crow threw a duel with Leo (as in, his landlady's son, not Rua) to help the rather depressed guy regain confidence.
</li><li> Crow <em>tried</em> to throw his second duel with Jeagar, because he was feeling sorry for the guy, whose wife and son were watching. Unfortunately, Jeagar was also trying to throw the duel (he needed to lose to get his family into protective custody without simply surrendering like a coward) and lost first.
</li><li> Andore was shown repeatedly throwing duels in a flashback because he didn't want to hurt his opponents' feelings. Jean invites him to join his team after observing his true skills, finally giving him the motivation to win.
</li><li> In a later episode, it was revealed that Dragan lost his previous duel with Jack to get money for his injured father. He isn't happy about it, and when he finds out, neither is Jack.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>, Tsukikage chooses not to play his last card that could have blocked Shinji's final attack after Renji ordered him to lose on purpose for his plan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Android 18 makes it to the final round of the World Martial Arts Tournament, clearly out-classing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">"champion" Mr. Satan</a>. Rather than beating him up and taking the title (which would draw unwanted attention and ruin his reputation if done in such a public venue), she decides to take a dive in exchange for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice">double</a></em> this tournament's prize money and a cut of all future prize money he ever earns.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, in the Champa arc, Goku eventually forfeits his match with Hit because he didn't think it was fair that the tournament's rules prevented Hit from fighting at his full potential. To repay his debt, Hit pretends that his next opponent, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the uber weak Monaka</span>, was able to defeat him with a single punch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry">Gundam Build Fighters Try</a></em>, two of Shimon's teammates confront Team Try Fighters, begging them to throw the fight so that Shimon can win the tournament for his sickly-but-recovering brother Mamoru. This shakes the team's resolve, but ultimately Sekai doesn't budge and he and Shimon go into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> to see who would go on.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10 S</a></em>, the second opponent from Nobuyuki's side is his wife Komatsu. While she is talented with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaginatasAreFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaginatasAreFeminine">naginata</a>, Yukimura's all too aware it wouldn't be seemly for Ana, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a>, to defeat his sister-in-law publicly, so Yukimura has Ana throw the fight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaloBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaloBox">Megalo Box</a></em>, the protagonist Junk Dog is caught in such a setup at the start of the story, forced to take a dive at the very last minute. That's despite the fact he's skilled enough to knock out his foes in the first round.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>: During the "Rescue Yukina" arc, the Toguro Brothers become Tarukane's bodyguards. When Yusuke, Kuwabara, and Botan attempt to rescue Yukina, Tarukane and his friends in the Black Black Club gamble on which side would win. It turns out the Toguro Brothers were secretly working for Sakyo, who bet on Yusuke's team, so after putting up a good fight, they pretend to lose, causing Tarukane to lose his fortune and his sanity. The Toguro Brothers then kill him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, Tenya Iida and Mei Hatsume find themselves in a one-on-one fight during the Sports Festival. However, Mei ends up giving him special support gear to help give it his all, which Iida accepts graciously. What he doesn't realize is that the entire thing is just a <em>ten minute advertisement to get companies biting towards her gear</em>. Once she's certain they've bitten and want more, she promptly throws the match. Iida is vastly upset at this.

</li></ul><ul><li> In ''Amazing Spider-Man #253", Ray Nesters is the star quarterback of an NFL team who is secretly taking payoffs to throw some games. He foolishly believes that this will end when he loses the final regular season game only to be informed that mob boss the Rose wants him to throw the playoffs as well. When he naturally refuses, the Rose has Ray's younger brother Tony kidnapped. When Ray goes on a rescue, Tony is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">heartbroken to realize the Rose has been telling the truth</a> on his brother's actions. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> is able to rescue them both, Ray knows the only way to get out from under the Rose's thumb is to confess the truth and accept his ruined career.

<ul><li> Two Golden Age stories centered around this trope, though the players weren't the ones cheating. In one, a boxer was drugged by his manager so that he would lose the fight, and in the other, a college football coach was trying to rig the game in favor of the other team.

Jerry and Robert end up facing each other in the final matchup at the national Olympic tryouts, with the younger, faster Robert far ahead on points but, as a point of pride and honor, refusing to simply keep evading Jerry and run out the clock. This backfires pretty badly when Jerry manages to land several good, hard blows and sets him up for the knockout, but Jerry suddenly has a change of heart and decides that the younger man deserves the chance to compete at the Olympics more than he does. He pulls back his punch within an inch of his opponent's face and hugs him until the bell, letting Robert take the win on points.

Falco prevents Gruff from making the kick by pulling the ball away. Nigel's leg is broken as a result, but he thanks Falco for saving his life.
</li><li> The premise of <em>The Set Up</em> (1949). The washed-up boxer played by Robert Ryan is supposed to take a dive, but he's so ill-favored that they don't even bother <em>telling</em> him till halfway through the fight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMilkyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMilkyWay">The Milky Way</a></em> everyone gets the mistaken impression that wimpy milkman Burleigh Sullivan knocked out boxing champion Speed McFarland on a public sidewalk (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>). In fact Burleigh didn't punch Speed and has no boxing talent, but Speed's weaselly manager Gabby Sloan comes up with the idea to make Burleigh into a fake contender by arranging a series of bouts with palookas who will take dives. Then Burleigh will fight Speed, who will get an easy victory. (Unsurprisingly, the plan goes wrong.)
</li><li> A key point of the 1994 film <em>Blue Chips</em> is college basketball coach Pete Bell ignoring stories of how boosters have been bribing his players. One booster mocks Bell on being so naive and boasts he "bought" one of his players three years earlier. Bell doesn't believe it as the student, Tony, is one of his favorites. He gets out a video tape of the game, watching it with some fellow coaches. They also don't believe it, citing things like Tony being ill that week and such. But as they watch the game, they see Tony missing plays he should easily be making and constantly checking the scoreboard and realize he did indeed shave points to help gamblers beat the spread.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Safe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Safe">Safe</a></em> is kicked off when Luke wins a boxing match he was supposed to throw.

Unaware, Roy initially assumes that the second brother is really good at selling the dive, but is then forced to knock him down. Tragically, the younger brother is found having seemingly hanged himself. No one is under any illusions that it was a suicide, but the sheriff is deep in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s pocket. Before the bet, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> demonstrates the power he has in the town by ordering one of the sparring fighters to take a dive by standing up, straightening his tie, and turning his fist thumb down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end, the protagonist does the exact same gesture to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s surprise fighter (a prisoner he paid in advance) to take an obvious dive</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SplitDecisions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SplitDecisions">Split Decisions</a></em> is about two brothers from a working class family with a passion for boxing. The older one is forced by a bunch of gangsters to take a dive in his next fight against their new champion, then gets murdered when he refuses. This is what gets his younger brother to face the new champion himself in the ring.

He berates her for pulling such a stunt that they just resolve to do their best to see who comes out on top... which ends up being both of them.</span>

Wrestlers fighting in their final match while having 7 wins (thus needing the last win to avoid demotion) win 80% of the time when fighting opponents who have already got 8, suggesting that the latter athlete (who won't gain anything from going from 8 to 9 victories) is simply throwing the fight to allow the other wrestler to avoid demotion.

Instead the lord doesn't even remember him, and refuses to employ such an apparently inept knight.
</li><li> In the same novel Ser Uthor Underleaf suggests that he does this all the time. He's an incredible jouster, but never wins any tourneys because he bets on himself (with long odds) until he decides to lose (and then he bets on the other guy). If he actually won, he'd become more famous, and he'd never get those long odds again. This trope backfires on him as well when he finds himself up against a genuinely dangerous opponent in his last joust.

<ul><li> In a general context, sometimes parents, teachers and others in charge of things such as youth programs will ask kids to back off and not play so well on purpose if they see that a kid is, despite trying his darndest, failing to come even close to winning or achieving some modicum of success. So they'll say, "Let him win once or twice," as though to boost their confidence and encourage him/her.
<ul><li> This sometimes works, but only if the ruse is never revealed. If the kid catches wind of the "let him win" plot, his already low self-esteem will drop to rock-bottom.
</li></ul></li><li> It is often considered good etiquette to, during an outing (e.g., a golf outing) with the boss, to let the boss win a round or two, even if his partners are clearly better than he is. As such, they may be asked to throw a round or two to stay in the good graces of their boss.
</li><li> The most famous example is the 1919 Black Sox scandal, where eight members of the Chicago White Sox were paid to lose the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds, and were subsequently banned from baseball two years later.
<ul><li> So pervasive was sports gambling in the 1910s (a number of players, such as Hal Chase, were suspected of routinely throwing games to supplement their income) that the 1919 World Series nearly became one that players on <em>both</em> sides tried to sabotage. A gambling syndicate offered Cincinnati pitcher Hod Eller $5,000 to take a dive, but instead he threatened to break the legs of the runner making the offer. Years later, Eller's teammate Edd Roush, the Reds' best hitter, claimed that during one World Series game, a teammate ahead of him on the basepaths slowed down suspiciously until Roush yelled, "Get running, you crooked son of a bitch!!"
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Mist_Scandal_(Japanese_baseball)">very similar scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> happened in 1969-71 which almost destroyed baseball in Japan. It started when pitcher Masayuki Nagayasu of the Nishitetsu Lions was caught taking bribes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> to throw games. After he was released from the Lions, Nagasayu implicated six other Lions players of game-fixing. Soon the scandal spread to other teams such as the Toei Flyers and Kiniketsu Buffaloes, with around a dozen players being slapped with penalties ranging from "stern warnings" to lifetime bans. The scandal also resulted in the Lions and the Flyers being sold to new owners.
</li></ul></li><li> This isn't limited to players only, as referees have also been implicated in match fixing. The German Bundesliga, Brazilian Series A and the NBA have all experienced corrupted refs who have thrown games. Given player salaries in the top leagues, its more economical to bribe the lower paid sports officials.
</li><li> A lesser but related scam is point-shaving, which has been caught a few times over the years in college basketball. A player who knows the betting spread deliberately misses shots near the end of a game so that his team will win but not beat the spread. One of the more infamous cases of point-shaving involved the 1978-79 Boston College Eagles, who got mixed up with notorious mobsters Henry Hill and Jimmy Burke. When players started waffling on being involved, Hill told them that it was "hard to play basketball with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened">broken hands</a>".
<ul><li> The NBA a few years back had a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal">betting scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> along similar lines instigated by former referee Tim Donaghy, where he would call the games in such a way so that he looks fair with the calls but the scores are higher than they otherwise would be (i.e., 110-100 rather than 96-86). He would bet on the "over" of the over/under (you bet "over" if you think the sum of the two teams' scores will be greater than the given line, say 200.5, and under if you think the sum will be less) for the game prior to tip-off.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to match throwing is tanking, where a team may deliberately not win games for some advantage other than direct monetary gain.
<ul><li> For bad teams in a given year, there is an existing incentive to tank in North American sports (especially if there is a really good player that will enter the league next season) since teams which perform poorly are generally awarded high draft picks (ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThatOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThatOtherWiki">That Other Wiki</a> for <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports_league_organization">why this doesn't come up in European leagues<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Accusations in hockey include the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1983-84 (to secure the first pick over the New Jersey Devils and get Mario Lemieux) and the Ottawa Senators in 1992-93 (for Alexandre Daigle).
</li><li> The poor play of the Houston Rockets basketball team in 1982-83, which enabled it to choose Ralph Sampson first in the following year's NBA draft, drew enough suspicion to be parodied in the newspaper comic <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankMcNamara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankMcNamara">Tank Mc Namara</a></em> (one strip showed a fan holding a sign that read "We're No. 26!"). For this reason, the NBA and later the NHL have instituted lotteries whereby teams at the bottom are not guaranteed the first pick in the following year's draft. However, the odds are still heavily weighted towards the worst teams, and in any case teams are still sometimes accused of "playing for ping-pong balls."
<ul><li> This doesn't appear to be such a problem in Major League Baseball (possibly because the vast majority of those drafted go through several years in the minors first and many first-rounders don't ever make it to the bigs - it's rare for a rookie to land a spot on the roster before September call-ups after the minor leagues end their seasons) or the National Football League (possibly due to their large roster size and subsequent specialization of positions, meaning teams will have specific needs in a given year where a few slots in the draft board isn't something some savvy trades couldn't rectify<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1m0uc');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1m0uc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1m0uc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and that's assuming, if you're going for something like the number one pick, you'd be willing to shell out the eight-figure contracts for a player that may or may not pan out</span>; additionally teams with the same record are cycled through within their "pod" each round so that if in Round 1 you have the highest pick of all, say, six teams with 7-9 records, in Round 2 you now have the sixth and last pick of those teams), neither of which do lotteries.
</li></ul></li><li> There were also accusations of NFL teams intentionally doing bad in their final weeks of the season in order to gain an easier schedule next year. This was more prominent before 2002, when NFL divisions had five or six teams and more games on a team's schedule were determined by how well they did the previous season; nowadays only two games out of sixteen are determined by how well a team did, not much of an incentive and most likely not worth the rage the team's fans would have for shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to watch crap.
</li><li> With most such strategic use of losing, though, the verdict may depend on whether you believe the ends justify the means. The Pittsburgh Penguins in the early 2000s were in dire financial straits, as their previous years' success had come at a massive financial cost (their filing for bankruptcy and how to handle them was one of the biggest points that led to the 2004-05 Lockout). The Penguins were terrible during this time, but were able to use the high draft picks their poor records year in and year out granted them on star players like Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. This in turn eventually led to new success (and the income that goes with it), a Stanley Cup victory in 2009, and a brand new arena a couple of years later.
</li></ul></li><li> Even better teams may sometimes have an incentive to not go all-out to win:
<ul><li> The 2006 Los Angeles Clippers allegedly tanked to get the sixth seed (of eight) in the NBA Western Conference in order to both avoid the Dallas Mavericks in the first round (who had the better record that year and thus would have had home-court advantage) and delay facing the powerhouse Los Angeles Lakers until the third round of the playoffs (since the NBA Playoffs is a straight-up bracket). In addition, finishing sixth meant they faced the Denver Nuggets, who were only the third seed by virtue of winning their division: the Clippers actually had a better record, which meant <em>they</em> got home-court advantage. The NBA changed the rules following the season to prevent that occurring again.
</li><li> Taking this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12371147/2-prep-girls-teams-caught-tanking-banned-postseason">This 2015 girls' basketball game in Tennessee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a consolation game of a Nashville-area high school district tournament. Because of the way the regional was bracketed, the winner of the game would face the defending state champion<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note243zu');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note243zu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note243zu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which had already beaten both teams that season</span> in its regional semifinal, while the loser would avoid that team until the regional final, with both teams in <em>that</em> game going on to the sectional tournament (one step short of the state tournament). Given the incentives, <em>both</em> teams blatantly tanked the game until the officials called them out on it (the final straw came when one player was about to score in her own basket, but was stopped because her team had already committed <em>another</em> violation). The state association <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">banned both teams from the postseason</a>.
<ul><li> This isn't even limited to North America: Sweden's ice hockey team allegedly lost on purpose to Slovakia in the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics in order to avoid both the Czech Republic and Canada (both powerhouses) in the opening knockout rounds (there was even a Swedish 5-on-3 power play where five NHL stars were on the ice and none of them put a shot anywhere near the goal). They faced Switzerland instead, and later went on to win the gold.
</li><li> One of the most overt examples from the Olympics occurred in the women's doubles in badminton at the 2012 London games. Four teams - two from South Korea, one each from China and Indonesia - deliberately lost their final group matches in order to draw weaker opponents in the quarter-finals (the other Chinese team had honestly but unexpectedly lost earlier in the day and sent them to second in their group). Unfortunately, their unnaturally weak performances in the matches (constantly hitting the net, missing trivial hits, and otherwise playing like it was their first badminton match in their entire lives) drew immediate suspicion from officials and spectators alike, and all four pairs were expelled from the tournament after an official investigation and replaced by four previously eliminated teams from Australia, Canada, Russia, and South Africa.
</li></ul></li><li> Other times, teams might tank in order to stop someone else from getting into the playoffs: In 1988, the San Francisco 49ers lost their final game of the regular season to the Los Angeles Rams, which prevented the New York Giants (who had beaten them a couple of times in previous years) from getting in the playoffs. Phil Simms was not happy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3c67m');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3c67m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3c67m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, that part could have been avoided had the Giants held on to win their regular-season finale against their Giants Stadium co-tenant New York Jets. Had the Giants' won; instead of needing help to get in the playoffs as a wild-card, the Giants would have won the NFC East division with an 11-5 record. As it happened, the Giants' loss coupled with the Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Dallas Cowboys (in what turned out to be Tom Landry's swan song as the team's head coach before new owner Jerry Jones took over and decided to start over from scratch in Dallas) left both teams with 10-6 records; with the Eagles winning the division thanks to a head-to-head tiebreaker, having swept the Giants in their two meetings that season.</span>
</li><li> In the mid-1970s, the NFL's tie-breaking rules were labyrinthine and often counter-intuitive, which culminated in a situation at the end of the 1977 season where the Baltimore Colts were able to nearly guarantee the elimination of AFC East divisional rival New England Patriots (with the help of fellow division rivals, the Miami Dolphins) by <em>losing</em> their Week 13 game to the Detroit Lions, rather than winning it (and, importantly, by also beating New England the following week in the final regular season game). The Colts lost to the Lions by having a punt blocked and returned for a touchdown on the final play of the game. Some vocal New England fans accused Baltimore of throwing the game simply to ensure that the Patriots would be essentially eliminated from playoff contention (their only hope was in Miami losing to the significantly inferior Buffalo Bills in their last game; Miami ended up beating Buffalo 31-14) even before their final week match-up (which, in the event, Baltimore rallied from behind to win and take the division crown). There is no reason to believe that Baltimore lost the Lions game intentionally (indeed, the team had just rallied to a 10-6 lead with four minutes left in the game, prior to the ill-fated final punt attempt); but the freak nature of the final scoring play, combined with the impact on the complex playoff race, left Patriots fans with a good deal of resentment.
</li><li> Sometimes teams play to a specific score which benefits both sides: take the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgrace_of_Gij%C3%B3n">1982 World Cup match<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between West Germany and Austria, the last game in Group B. Due to tiebreaker rules at the time, a 1-0 or 2-0 West German win would have seen both teams through to the elimination rounds. A bigger West German win would eliminate Austria, whereas a tie or Austrian win would eliminate West Germany; in either case, Algeria would have gone through instead. West Germany scored after 10 minutes, and the two teams spent the remaining 80 minutes kicking the ball around aimlessly. Algerians weren't the only ones pissed off: a West German fan burned his own flag in protest, and both German and Austrian commentators were disgusted. This only happened because Algeria had played their final match the previous day, giving Austria and West Germany time to realise there was a result that benefitted them both; to prevent this from happening again, every World Cup since has had each group's final two matches take place at the same time. If you're asking what happened to Austria and West Germany later in the tournament, the former faltered in the second group stage while the latter went all the way to the final where they were ultimately battered 3-1 by Italy.
<ul><li> There was a similar event in the final match of the season-ending play-offs in the English football league in 1898. Stoke needed a draw or better to remain in the First Division the next season, and Burnley needed the same result to be promoted. The match finished 0-0, with neither side even pretending to try to score. The league responded by replacing the "test match" system with automatic promotion and relegation. It also increased the top flight to 18 teams, with the victims of Stoke's and Burnley's alleged manipulation, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United, joining the top flight.
</li><li> And also in the next-to-last round of the 1992Â–93 Serie A season in Italy, when AC Milan played Brescia. Milan entered the game needing only a draw to win the title ahead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">crosstown rival</a> Internazionale, while Brescia believed a draw would be enough to stave off relegation to Serie B. In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/aug/11/theknowledge.sport">a 2004 look back at the "dodgiest games" in football history<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, two British journalists remarked, "For over 80 minutes, the two teams engaged in a shameful game of cat-and-mouse, in which the cat appeared to have fallen asleep and the mouse was on tranquilisers." Milan scored in the 82nd minute... but then took a breather on defense, letting Brescia level the score two minutes later. The game ended 1Â–1, giving Milan their title, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">other results went against Brescia and they were relegated</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A strange version of this occurred in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_4%C2%962_Grenada_(1994_Caribbean_Cup_qualification)">Caribbean Cup in 1994<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, due to an unusual rule that meant a win in extra time was considered a two-goal win. Barbados had to beat Grenada by two goals in order to progress. Barbados were 2-0 up when, in the 83rd minute, Grenada pulled a goal back. Deciding that seven minutes wasn't enough time to restore their two-goal lead, Barbados instead scored an own goal to tie the game at 2-2 and try and force extra time, where they would have thirty minutes to try and score again and earn the necessary two-goal win. Grenada realized what they were doing and tried to score an own goal of their own, resulting in the last few minutes of normal time becoming a spectacle where Grenada tried to score in either goal while Barbados were defending <em>both</em> goals! Barbados would eventually win in extra time.
</li><li> Another infamous soccer example was the 1998 Tiger Cup (former name of the soccer competition of Southeast Asia). Thailand and Indonesia were in the same group and, going into the final game of the group stage, both nations were guaranteed to progress. Whoever topped the group would face hosts Vietnam, while the runners-up would face Singapore. Both teams thought that Vietnam would be the tougher opposition so they played rather half-heartedly, neither wanting to win. In the final seconds, with the score at 2-2, Indonesian player Mursyid Effendi scored a deliberate own goal to give Thailand a 3-2 win and the unfancied tie against Vietnam. Sure enough, Vietnam won that game 3-0... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">but Indonesia also lost to Singapore</a>, who went on to win the whole thing.
</li><li> In the NFL, teams that have already earned playoff spots going into the final week(s) of the regular season often sit their star players - the Indianapolis Colts are known for doing this, among others. In such cases, it's usually because winning another game doesn't earn them anything (i.e., they've already won their division or the top seed and can't finish any better) but actually trying could get their star players injured and totally screw up their playoff run. This can lead to cases where Team A could lose to Team B, who's trying to get in the playoffs... and face Team A, who's now rested and has seen up close how Team B plays - see 2004, Colts versus Broncos. In an effort to prevent meaningless Week 17 games, starting in 2010 the NFL's schedule has all division games in the final week, where teams would presumably be motivated by rivalry to play hard.
<ul><li> Of course, such shenanigans don't always work. In 2009, the Cincinnati Bengals faced the New York Jets at home in the final week of the season. Cincinnati had already locked up its best possible playoff seeding, but New York needed to win to get into the playoffs. Since New York would play at Cincinnati the next week if they entered the playoffs (their game was the Sunday night game and the last scheduled game of the regular season), Cincinnati played with minimal effort to avoid risking their players to injury or tipping off any of their plays. New York won, made the playoffs, and then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">beat the Bengals in the playoffs the next week</a></em>. The football gods chortled.
</li></ul></li><li> When it comes to international competition, politics may enter the picture. In the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup#Group_B">second round of the 1978 FIFA World Cup<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Argentina (who were hosts and had just undergone a coup d'etat two years before that put the country in the grip of a military dictatorship) needed to beat Peru by four goals in order to edge out Brazil by goal difference and make it to the final. This task was made even more daunting by the fact that Argentina had only scored six goals in their first five games, while Peru had only <em>conceded</em> six goals in their first five games. Argentina won the match 6-0, prompting accusations of shenanigans (that the Peruvian goalie was born in Argentina, that Peru was dependent on grain sales from Argentina, etc.), though nothing was ever proven.
</li></ul></li><li> Competitive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> There was a scandal in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> leagues where a number of players, including the previously dominant Savior, were found to have deliberately lost matches for money.
</li><li> A much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">funnier example</a> happened at the 2011 ASUS ROG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> Tournament <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X3nS8GmGQI">during a match between BratOK and Stephano<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Neither of the players wanted to win, because that would mean going up against a crazy good player called Sen. Not wanting to simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a> immediately and have the fans turn on them for wasting their time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">both players do impossibly funny implausible builds in attempts to lose</a>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCynicalBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCynicalBrit">TotalBiscuit</a> and co-commentator Apollo try not to lose their composure at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">what they were seeing.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> by the Oakland Raiders in the penultimate week of the 1976 season. It starts with the Pittsburgh Steelers. After beating the Raiders in three playoff games in three seasons, in '76 they needed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">Miracle Rally</a> in the second half of the season - <em>plus a loss by the division rival Cincinnati Bengals</em> - to even <em>make</em> the postseason. The Bengals were playing the Raiders that night, and it was believed by the media that Oakland <strong>would</strong> throw the game in order to avoid meeting the Steelers in the playoffs again. Instead, they gave it all their effort and beat the Bengals 35-20. The Raiders capped the awesomeness by <em>finally</em> beating the Steelers in the AFC Championship, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">utterly demolishing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">the Minnesota Vikings</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XI to capture the Raiders' first championship.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGameCommunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGameCommunity">Fighting Game Community</a> strongly discourages this in tournaments.
</li><li> This became an issue in professional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em> play in some regions, so much so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve Software</a> began issuing <strong>lifetime bans</strong> from competitive play for anyone discovered engaging in match fixing.
<ul><li> One of the first cases of this came about when someone named Alexei "Solo" Berezin betted 100$ <em>against</em> his own Rox.Kis team during a match against Z Rage in which his team was heavily favored to win <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4jsca');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4jsca" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4jsca');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this was the last game of the series and the result wouldn't actually have mattered</span>. Come the match itself, and Rox.Kis began making some really questionable plays, as though deliberately dicking around in order to let Z Rage win - which they did. Then the betting site sent a report of the match-fixing scandal to the organization and as a result, Solo received a one-year ban from his organisation, a three-year ban from his team (who eventually kicked him out entirely), and a lifetime ban from Starladder (reduced to one year after he apologised for the incident). Compared to later match-fixers, he got off pretty lightly.
</li><li> Another, even more controversial incident occurred when two members of Arrow Gaming, Kok Yi "ddz" Liong &amp; Fua Hsien "Lance" Wan, bet really expensive items (Arcanas, Whaleclaw Hook, Golden Immortals, you name it) against their own team in their match against CSW, which again was a match that Arrow Gaming was heavily favored to win but would have no bearings on the standings. Come the match and the team - but particularly those two - made really questionable plays, such as intentionally pursuing against five heroes, and even teleporting right in front of them to feed even more. Once the match was over and Arrow Gaming had lost, controversy arose when organizers discovered the betting scandals, and only intensified when the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">repeatedly tried to deny it and claim it was a fluke in spite of all the evidence</a>, even arranging a fake chat to pin the blame on others. Eventually, Arrow Gaming had no choice but to apologize and yield; they were permanently banned from all Valve-sanctioned tournaments, and disbanded shortly afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> This was a major issue in Sumo for a time due to the rule that a sumo wrestler with 8 total wins would receive a huge bonus. A match between a wrestler with an 8-6 score and one with a 7-7 score would almost always result in a win by the wrestler with the 7-7 score, granting both an 8-7 score. In rematches, the previous losers won 80% of the time. Wrestlers began confessing to throwing the matches.
</li><li> The 1992 USA Basketball <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamTeam">Dream Team</a> lost one game <em>ever</em>: their first practice against a group of college all-stars led by Chris Webber, Grant Hill, and Penny Hardaway. Assistant coach Mike Krzyewski claims that head coach Chuck Daly deliberately threw that game by doing things like limiting Michael Jordan's playing time, not making any strategic adjustments, and making non-optimal substitutions in order to prove to his team that they <em>could</em> be beaten and couldn't slack off. The Dreamers demanded a rematch the next day and crushed the college guys.
</li><li> A non-sports example: it has been speculated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RTE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RTE">RTÃ‰</a> selected Paul Harrington &amp; Charlie McGettigan's "Rock 'n' Roll Kids" as Ireland's entry in the 1994 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> over other songs deemed superior purely to tank the competition, as they didn't want to pay the costs of hosting Eurovision for a third year in a row. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">It backfired</a>, as "Rock 'n' Roll Kids" not only won but became the highest-scoring song in Eurovision history up to that point, earning Ireland the contest's first and only three-peat. This was the inspiration for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FatherTedS2E5ASongForEurope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FatherTedS2E5ASongForEurope">"A Song for Europe"</a>, in which Ted and Dougal's terrible song is selected in the knowledge that they'll bomb, as well as a subplot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EurovisionSongContestTheStoryOfFireSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EurovisionSongContestTheStoryOfFireSaga">Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga</a></em> in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Victor Karlosson has all the competitors in <em>SÃ¶ngvakeppnin</em>, the contest to select Iceland's Eurovision representative, killed save for Lars and Sigrit so that a duo he sees as talentless will inevitably embarrass themselves and lose</span>.
