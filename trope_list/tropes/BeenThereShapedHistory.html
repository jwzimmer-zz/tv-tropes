Also, he started the Renaissance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> occasionally features Morpheus becoming involved with or perpetuating some of history's biggest legends. Throughout the Fables and Reflections trade paperback, he is the catalyst behind the City of Glass myth, as well as giving Joshua Norton the dream to become the Emperor of the United States on a bet with his siblings. He also made an arrangement with Shakespeare, giving him the stories and the immortality he wanted in return for two plays: <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> as a gift to Oberon and Titania, and <em>The Tempest</em> for himself.
<ul><li> The Greek poet Orpheus was also suitably retconned into becoming Morpheus' son, with many of the Endless helping to perpetuate his famous descent into the Underworld to retrieve his dead wife. For that matter, many of Apollo's deeds are explained as Morpheus' doing, with him explaining that Apollo was a god of storytellers and legends; aspects which fall under Dream's purview and confuse casual listeners.
</li><li> All explainable by the fact that it's Dream's job to inspire people to greatness. So most people with lasting fame have interacted with him in some level. And by the fact that he's the personification of <em>dreaming</em>: both the dreams you have when you sleep, and the dreams that you strive for when awake.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a></em> alternately averts this trope and plays it straight. Robo participates in World War II in a story where Robo is off on a side mission while real-life soldiers are fighting real-life battles; goes along for the ride for the first Mars probe mission but does not contribute anything to the actual accomplishments of NASA; and he declares himself neutral during the Cold War. He has, however, been to the moon, but probably well after humans had already made it. Essentially, Atomic Robo qualifies in that he's around for all sorts of historical events, but he's an aversion because he never takes away from what was done by historical human beings. It's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">stated intention</a> of the producers <em>not</em> to reduce the significance of any historical figures' effort or sacrifice.

<ul><li> Uncle Scrooge once boasted about his wrestling skills (to Roosevelt, while they were fighting) by mentioning that he once met Sitting Bull. Back then he was known as "Standing Bull."

In the follow-up setting, when he joins the Imperium of Man, he naturally plays a significant role in shaping Imperial history.

All three of Sable's major wars in the past 100 years (the Revolution, Great Tousterre, and Idvitzen Invasion) basically dominoed from actions taken by the characters during the manga. The destructive climax of <em>Pandora Hearts</em> became the flashpoint of a building anti-nobility movement against the Four Great Dukedoms which led to the Revolution and divesting of the nobility; the Revolution's political instability opened up an opportunity for the Empire of Lucya to make a power grab that caused the Great Tousterre War; and the tensions left between Sable and its enemies in that war led to the Idvitzen invasion three decades later.

During their travel, they cause the Great Fire of Moscow, the legend of Paul Bunyun, the naming of the French Foreign Legion, and the mass extinction of Mars billions of years before the present.

She's also the reason that the giant Ægir is known as the Drowned God (as she dumped him in a lake after he drunkenly flirted with her at a party).
</li><li> Thor was Joramun, the King-Beyond-The-Wall who fought the Others in the Long Night. And in addition to inspiring the Warrior of the Seven, he was also viewed as both the Storm God of the Ironborn <em>and</em> the one defied by Durran Godsgrief.
</li><li> Loki is the most prolific, as over the course of his many pilgrimages to Midgard he taught Lann the Clever everything he knew, guided King Theon Stark towards raiding Andalos, convinced Ser Criston Cole to get revenge on Rhaenrya by siding with Aegon II, and wrote the Pureborn of Qarth's rules and doctrines.

He inspired the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, and returned to Mexico as one of Cortez's conquistadors, and shot Hitler.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> series often moves in this direction, having him not only indirectly responsible for important events in British history, but also having him as the inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrisonerOfZenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrisonerOfZenda">The Prisoner of Zenda</a></em> and <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> (!). One novella, <em>Flashman and the Tiger,</em> has him getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">lawyer friendly cameos</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and Watson and isn't as well done since the series (outside of the characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomBrownsSchooldays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomBrownsSchooldays">Tom Brown's Schooldays</a></em>) doesn't have literary characters as real people, only as the inspirations for them.
<ul><li> Fictional uncertainties aside, Flashman certainly serves as a splendid Gump, as his career spans virtually every notable conflict in the world from the First Afghan War to the Boxer Rebellion (though sadly his author died before recounting some of Flashman's highest-profile adventures, e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> and (most) of the Zulu War).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em> is a similar example—if he'd been killed in India, Britain would probably have lost the Napoleonic Wars. Some things Sharpe is responsible for: the assassination of Tipu Sultan; saving the Duke of Wellington's life; the capture of Gawilghur; stopping an Indo-French treaty (by murdering an accredited diplomat no less) to force Britain out of India; capturing the Danish fleet at Copenhagen; securing funding for the Lines of Torres Vedras; the explosion at Almeida; covering up a scandal involving the Peer's brother and the British ambassador to Spain; leading the Forlorn Hope at Badajoz; shooting the Prince of Orange at the Battle of Waterloo; helping the Chilean Revolution to succeed.
<ul><li> Similarly, the character of Uhtred from the <em>Saxon Stories</em> series is involved in most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlfredTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlfredTheGreat">Alfred the Great</a>'s campaigns against the Danes. His absence from historical records is explained in-universe as the result of a dislike for the pagan Uhtred on the part of the Christian monks who wrote them. In both cases, the series began as attempts to depict the careers of famous historical figures—the Duke of Wellington and Alfred the Great, respectively—from a different, more earthy perspective than usual.
</li><li> His American Civil War character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Nathaniel Starbuck</a>, was responsible for warning Nathan Evans (who is portrayed as a hilariously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>) of the Union flanking movement at the First Battle of Manassas Junction, thus saving the Confederacy and setting the stage for a long Civil War.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHellequinChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHellequinChronicles">The Hellequin Chronicles</a></em> has the main character, Nate get heavily involved in history. This is justified largely by the fact that he was Merlin's hatchet man and generally meant to intimidate a number of human leaders into behaving.
</li><li> The Brazilian novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OHomemQueMatouGetulioVargas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OHomemQueMatouGetulioVargas">O Homem Que Matou Getulio Vargas</a></em> (released in English as <em>Twelve Fingers: Biography of an Anarchist</em>) has an interesting inversion—the main character, a Serbian assassin, would be responsible for several historical events, like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the transport of French troops to the Marne and the bribery of the jury who put Al Capone in jail, if he didn't always screw up. He does however "suicide" the titular Brazilian president (who is distantly related to him).

Forester did this while at the same time using many real historical figures (there was a Captain Pellew, for example), but usually not in a way that you'd expect their interaction to merit special historical notice. (You can see the full list <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Hornblower#Historical_figures_in_the_novels">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>.)
<ul><li> <em>Commodore Hornblower,</em> set in 1812, specifically places Hornblower in the Baltic dealing with Russia. This was to avoid any mention of the War of 1812 between the British and the USA. The stories themselves were written 1937 to 1967, and avoiding any hint of conflict between the RN and the USA was a priority.

He remembers being involved in many of the most horrifying events in recent American History, everything from The Manson Family to handing Lee Harvey Oswald pamphlets, meeting Donald Defreeze (and suggesting the name Cinque in the first place), went to school with Charles Starkweather, and plenty else. All the more horrifying in that he has absolutely no investment in any of this, any misguided cause, or even desire to profit. He just likes to be part of the hate.

Among other examples, it inserts Milady De Winter into the 1628 assassination of the Duke of Buckingham, all four musketeers into the execution of Charles I and the eventual restoration of Charles II, Athos' son Raoul into the story of Louis XIV's mistress Louise de la Valliere, and D'Artagnan into nearly every military campaign of any significance in the 17th century.

Of course, it was during a poker game."). One Chee is also said to have been a famous actress in a previous life-cycle.
<ul><li> Averted, too: For example, Eric mentions he worked on the pyramids—as a slave hauling blocks.
</li><li> The Chee take care to stay out of any great historical events. Erek mentioning that he thought up "New Deal" is probably the most they've ever contributed. Most often they're just on the sidelines, such as Erek mentioning he was Beethoven's assistant for a few years, and at least one Chee is a homeless person.

He goes on to ask Crowley about an invention, which apparently he later takes credit for. Subverted with Crowley's commendation from Below for the Spanish Inquisition — he <em>was</em> in Spain at the time... relaxing at cantinas and generally having a good time.

Since they have to make discoveries periodically, the author has them make all the discoveries of Flinders Petrie, a real-life Egyptologist who worked in the same era. In order to avoid the awkwardness of actually meeting him, the author gave the main character's husband an uncontrollable dislike of him.

However, she claims to have had romantic trysts with Pablo Picasso, Sigmund Freud, and Winston Churchill, opened a pizzeria with the woman who would later become Mama Celeste, was friends with Golda Meir, and she and Sal had a flat tire at the same building as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (although in a later episode she claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">"I was at the movies that day.

<ul><li> The Golden fleece makes sense seeing as Hercules was one of the Argonauts.

<ul><li> Pompeii was the result of an Immortal being killed on sacred ground. There's a reason why all Immortals respect sacred ground.
</li><li> The title character, Duncan MacLeod, being 400 years old has plenty of history to get involved in, but he goes out of his way to involve himself in events relating to Scottish nationalism.

</li><li> Ray leaves footprints behind in the Jurassic period (though paleontologists assume it is a hoax) and becomes Sir Galahad of the King Arthur mythos after the original one dies.
</li><li> During the Apollo 13 incident, Stein distracts the entire control room at a crucial moment by singing the Banana Boat song.
</li><li> Even the JSA gets into the mix. Stargirl went back in time to found Camelot as Merlin.
</li></ul></li><li> In the flashbacks of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>'s fifth season finale, the infamous <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacob</span> appears repeatedly in other peoples' flashbacks, always being responsible for something important in those characters' lives: he buys Kate the lunchbox she uses for her time capsule, gives Sawyer a pen with which to write his letter to the real Sawyer, preventing Sayid from being hit by the car that kills <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nadia</span>, saying hello to Sun and Jin at their wedding, asking Ilana for help with an unspecified task, speaking to—and possibly reviving—Locke after he is thrown out a window, giving Jack a candy bar after his first surgery, and convincing Hurley to return to the island.
<ul><li> In a simply "stumbling through history" case, Nikki and Paulo's episode shows them discovering the Beechcraft and the Pearl station before the other castaways, and seeing major events of the show (the plane crash, the "live together, die alone" speech, and in a deleted scene, the discharge).
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>' season 10 opener "Great Balls of Fire", in which both a firebomb hurled by the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerOfTheWeek">Killer Of The Week</a> and a carelessly tossed cigar belonging to Constable Higgins are suggested as possible sources of the Great Toronto Fire of 1904. Neither were actually responsible, though.
<ul><li> Played straight in the Season 8 episode "All That Glitters". A heavily criticized landscape painting by Inspector Brackenreid proves inspirational to one of the assistants at an art exhibition: famed lanscape painter Tom Thomson, whose style is similar to the Inspector's.
</li><li> Played straight in Season 9's "Unlucky in Love", which implies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LMMontgomery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LMMontgomery">L. M.

Promptly lampshaded in the end title card:
<div class="indent"> Despite the story you have just seen there is no evidence to suggest that Lucy Maud Montgomery met Constable George Crabtree or that her work was influenced by him. (He's not real).
</div></li><li> Regularly played with in the later season appearances of James Pendrick, who is portrayed as developing an electric car prototype (and being cheated out of his invention by Henry Ford), inventing the airplane, becoming an early silent film director (and butting heads with Thomas Edison), and building the first space rocket.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, Rumpelstiltskin is present throughout most of the different fairy tales, even replacing the role of the Fairy Godmother in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2f395');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2f395" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2f395');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He made the opening by killing the fairy meant to help Cinderella just to take her wand.</span> and the Beast in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> often had Sam Beckett being responsible for a great many things while in the guise of various people. Creator Donald Bellisario referred to these as "kisses with history," giving Sam a chance to slyly affect the world more than just what the main plot required. Among the many things that Sam is responsible for are teaching The Twist to Chubby Checker, performing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Heimlich Maneuver on Dr. Heimlich</a>, giving a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> ideas for some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Christine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Christine">scary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">stories</a>, encouraging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a> to continue with music (even helping him write "Peggy Sue" by trying to catch a pig), and teaching the Moon Walk to a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>.
<ul><li> By the last season, these became less subtle. Sam leapt into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>'s personal bodyguard (keeping her alive long enough to make <em>The Misfits</em>), Lee Harvey Oswald (where it turns out that Jackie Kennedy died in the original history) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> (having to ensure the King of Rock and Roll would get his big break).
</li><li> Occasionally subverted as it seems Sam might be linked to a major event only to simply be caught up in it. In "Black and White on Fire," Sam leaps into a black man on the eve of the Watts riots. At first, he thinks his task is to stop the riots but Al tells him the key arrest that set it off has already happened and that the riots themselves were going to occur one way or another.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, Lister ends up playing a part in the JFK assassination, thanks to time travel abuse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (He doesn't actually pull the trigger, he merely convinces JFK to go back in time and assassinate himself.)</span>
</li><li> Vorenus and Pullo on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em> have been described as the Forrest Gumps (Sylvanus Gumpae) of Ancient Rome. They are the direct cause of, or at least heavily involved in, several key events during the late republican years through the rise of Augustus. A few examples include: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pullo actually fathering Caesarion (Caesar's son by Cleopatra), the results of one of Pullo's barfights leading to Caesar crossing the Rubicon, saving Octavius from captivity, finding Cleopatra, Vorenus helping Marc Antony committ suicide, Vorenus' departure from the senate house making it possible for Brutus and company to murder Caesar, Pullo killing Cicero</span>... And that's just a few examples.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in that one of the aforementioned episodes is even called "How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Republic".
</li><li> In another they have a chance to capture Pompey after the Battle of Pharsalus but let him go. Caesar is not amused but concludes they must have "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">powerful gods on their side</a>" considering how much unlikely shit they've gone through and decides not to punish them.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Helen Magnus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> is 160 years old, has lived through the 20th century (give or take a few decades in Victorian London), and has had various run-ins with various historical figures including most U.S. Presidents and world leaders. The last time she was shipwrecked was "April, 1912." The opening theme has shown photographs of her with Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart and Gandhi. She and a couple of school chums were directly responsible for the success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">the D-Day invasion at Normandy</a> - and the school chums in question were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a> and James Watson (Sherlock Holmes himself). Oh, and her fiancé was Jack the Ripper.

During an episode where much of the main cast was transported to the time period of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">the original series,</a> they were responsible for many off-screen events which took place during "The Trouble With Tribbles" episode. Thus, it is an example of <em>DS9</em> playing this to another fictional series.
<ul><li> Particularly notable because the technology used to insert Forrest Gump in historical footage is exactly the one used to create this episode. The very episode was inspired by a technician showing off some quick'n'dirty insertion in an original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> episode. (It helped that the TOS masters were surprisingly well preserved.)
</li></ul></li><li> Another episode has several of the characters going back to pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> times, to the time of an uprising in San Francisco that caused a major overhaul to the laws regarding the unemployed/homeless.

Black Fury kinfolk encouraged leaders of the early women's movement to take refuge near New York's Finger Lakes (a Black Fury stronghold), which lead to the 1848 Seneca Falls convention.

</li><li> All in all, the Supernatural generally moves along with human developments rather then setting them off...which makes a good deal of sense when you think about it, there are more mortals than Supernaturals, and most Supers are too busy handling their own stuff to really mess around with human society too much. Throw in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, Veil, and the general "Do NOT let the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">normals</a> know what's REALLY going on" approach the varying splats take, minor influence and the occasional nudge is about all the Supernatural does to influence the wider world... there are exceptions, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTunguskaEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTunguskaEvent">Tunguska</a> being caused by SOMETHING involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">the Quasmalilim</a>, and Dracula having been a very powerful Kindred, but these are exceptions rather then the general rule of thumb.

<ul><li> In 1969 Delta Green organizes an unsanctioned raid on Cambodia, where 300 Marines paradrop on Cambodia attempting to stop the summoning of a Great Old One, the operation fails spectacularly. When the US and South Vietnam invade Cambodia later, they meet stiff resistance from well-prepared Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge, the military's Joint Chiefs consider the intervention in Cambodia a failure due Delta Green's shenanigans seven months prior.

<div class="indent">"DELTA GREEN uses a similar principle, combining operatives from several different agencies and units both civilian and military.

</div></li><li> In 1993 Delta Green discovered information about what they thought it was a mythos cult in Waco, Texas. The agents organize the ATF and FBI to raid the cult's compound resulting in the now-infamous Waco Siege. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They were wrong, there was nothing particularly unnatural on Waco. 76 people died due Delta Green's faulty intel.</span>
</li><li> During the Katrina hurricane, there were a lot of reports of gunfire shots in New Orleans after the levees broke.

Most gods, mythical heroes, legendary monsters and the like are somewhat distorted accounts of witches and otherkin; witches were major players in the Underground Railroad and were responsible for starting the American civil war; open Witch and Otherkin influence was pivotal in the flourishing of science and the arts in the late 19th and early 20th century and Allied victory in World War II — but was later erased from records and memory by the witches; the Flower Power movement was the result of a large-scale spell cast by the counselor and several students at Coventry school for girls... it goes on like this for a bit.

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em> character can run missions that set up events for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">heroes</a> at the equivalent level. For example, a heroic storyarc starts off when a gang get their hands on a powerful spellbook and accidentally summon a major demon. A villainous contact at the same level range offers a mission to steal a spellbook and plant it for members of a minor gang to find...
<ul><li> As <em>City of Villains</em> launched over two years later than <em>City Of Heroes</em>, chances are by the time your villain plants the book, your various hero characters will already have stopped the demon <em>several times</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> at its finest...
<ul><li> For another example, one villainous badge mission involves spreading some drug called Outbreak around Paragon City. That is the drug that caused the contaminated infestation of the heroes' tutorial zone.

</li><li> There are actually a lot of these in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a>. Any time someone makes a game and they want to set it during the movies, if they don't stick with the movie characters, they <em>will</em> make important new ones. There are a whole <em>mess</em> of people responsible for getting the Death Star plans to Leia, for example, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy">Bria Tharen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Kyle Katarn</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em> 's story starts around the same time as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>. As such, the protagonist Dash Rendar took part in the Battle of Hoth; this was only mentioned in the novel, but an actual level in the game. It was the first time a <em>Star Wars</em> game allowed the player to take part in a movie battle like it (excluding the Death Star trench run from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>), and nearly every classic-trilogy <em>Star Wars</em> game since has had a Hoth level if the developers could find an excuse to add one. One problem, however, is that the second level starts with Dash witnessing the <em>Millenium Falcon</em>'s escape from the base just before snowtroopers pour in - and yet Dash somehow manages to <em>completely miss</em> encountering Darth Vader, who also saw the <em>Falcon</em> fly off. Also, in a double-example, Dash was a pivotal member of the team that captured the supercomputer containing the plans to the second Death Star - an event so important that the player gets to see him do it again in a mission from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWingAlliance">X-Wing Alliance</a></em>, setting the player as the "Blue 6" who shouted at the team to scatter after the freighter with that supercomputer launches a diamond-boron missile (of course, since the <em>XWA</em> protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime">never speaks</a>, someone ends up shouting his line).

<ul><li> It was based on a book by the same name. There was also "Mr. Revere and I", by the same author, though that's less of a case of this, and more just an onlooker at many of the events, since it's narrated by Paul Revere's horse.

Unable to find him, he tracks down every Philip J. Fry in the country. One of them happens to be in Florida, counting ballots from the recent election. Bender enters and begins firing a laser gun, and one of the stray blasts destroys a large stack of ballots labeled "Gore", causing George W. Bush to win the election.

Ever since then, Grandad felt that Parks "stole his thunder" and left her harassing phone calls right up until her death. Oh, and he never did get his five dollars from Malcolm X.
<ul><li> And he was supposed to be one of the protesters Bull Connor turned firehoses on, but he went home to get a raincoat and missed the march. Robert gets a lot of these related to the civil rights movement.
