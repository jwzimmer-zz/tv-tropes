<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> came to prominence for the work he did in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, where he worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> as well as a few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> stories. This was a five-year period, a small part of his career where, for the most part, he has worked for alternative and independent publications as well as self-published ventures.
<ul><li> Furthermore, his four-year run on Swamp Thing was really the only pre-existing DC property Moore spent any substantial time on. Apart from his own original creations in <em>Watchmen</em> and <em>V for Vendetta</em>, Moore never wrote more than three issues of any other DC character.
</li><li> The year before <em>The Killing Joke</em>, Moore wrote another Batman issue called "Mortal Clay". These are the only two Batman issues Moore ever wrote.
</li></ul></li><li> A fandom example: the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> has had some eras that were either famous or infamous, but they really didn't last long at all:
<ul><li> Supergirl only had about 14 substantial appearances during her run (depending on how you count), with another 9 in the 1980s. The run of "Supergirl and the Legion" from 2006-2008 had about as many issues as Supergirl's entire set of Legion appearances back to 1960, and most of her early ones weren't even full length stories.
</li><li> The Legion of Super-Pets only appeared 7 times and only had major roles in around four, also depending on how you count.
</li><li> The Adult Legion appeared in 9 stories total (plus LSH #300, which wrote it out of continuity).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> first appeared in 1939's <em>Detective Comics</em> #27. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a> the Boy Wonder debuted the following year in <em>Detective Comics</em> #38. Modern retellings of the Dark Knight Detective's early solo career have stretched that era out to at least two years, a very busy period covered by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween">The Long Halloween</a></em>, various issues of <em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em>, a guest appearance in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheManOfSteel">The Man of Steel</a></em>, and featuring the debuts of the Riddler, Two-Face, the Joker (as the Red Hood), Catwoman, and Hugo Strange. Most of these villains originally debuted after Robin. Some of these modern retellings, however, may no longer be canon.
<ul><li> The infamous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Batman uses a gun and kills criminals</a>" era, often used to justify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> portrayals. Based on retellings of it, you'd think that it'd lasted until the mid-50s and <em>Seduction Of The Innocent</em>. In reality, he stopped using guns almost entirely after a few issues, and the first indication of him having a code against killing dates to <em>Batman #4</em>, less than two years after his creation. (Though he was a target of <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em>, it focused on purported <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a>, not violence.)
</li></ul></li><li> Between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheInterregnum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheInterregnum">The Interregnum</a>, often thought of as a lengthy dark drought in the superhero genre.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08oqh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08oqh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08oqh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, to the original comic book historians, who were children at this time, it was.</span> If one measures it from the last appearance of the GA Flash (1951, <em>All-Star Comics</em>) to the first appearance of the SA Flash (1956, <em>Showcase</em>), it was only five years long. Given that DC Comics considers Superboy an Earth-1 (i.e., Silver Age) character, and Superboy debuted in <em>1945,</em> it could even be argued that the Golden Age and Silver Age <em>overlapped,</em> and the Interregnum thus had <em>negative</em> length!
</li><li> Ask any moderate comics fan who the core members of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders">The Defenders</a></em> are, and you'll immediately hear "The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SubMariner">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>." Sometimes they'll add Nighthawk, or maybe Valkyrie. While Strange and Hulk have been on most versions of the Defenders, with Strange usually being the de facto leader, Namor and Surfer quit after just a few issues. People familiar with the original run will tell you that the Defenders <em>never</em> had a consistent lineup, and variously included nearly every hero and some villains active at the time.
<ul><li> This is part of the reason that modern revivals of the team tend to get cancelled quickly. As it turns out, not many writers can make the "classic" lineup work, since all the characters involved are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">grotesquely overpowered</a> and relative loners, but they assume that it has to work because the original comic made it work, right?
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, nearly every adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> either mentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> or makes heavy use of him: see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">the movie</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em>, etc. How many issues of the comic was Hulk a part of the team? <em>Two.</em> (He rejoined the team in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em>, to capitalize on the movie, but that was a comic written in 2012, and that was the first time he'd ever rejoined.) Flip open a comic from the '60s or '70s, and you're much more likely to see Black Knight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a>, Beast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">The Incredible Hercules</a>, or Moondragon, none of whom have managed Hulk's prominence on the Avengers in other media. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHulk">Red Hulk</a> has been on the team longer!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>'s controversial 'I Ching' period was only twenty-five issues of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">original run</a>, extended to five years' time-wise by an intermittent publishing schedule. But it was during that period that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1974">pilot movie</a> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CathyLeeCrosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CathyLeeCrosby">Cathy Lee Crosby</a> was developed, which lead it to look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> in comparison with the better-known take of the character, and in turn led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie">pilot movie</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman">the series featuring the more traditional take</a> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaCarter">Lynda Carter</a> being called <em>The New Original Wonder Woman</em>. The Pilot Movie is known to even non-comics' fans, the original storyline, not as much, except for Gloria Steinem's denouncement of it.
</li><li> In an early '70s issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBraveAndTheBold">The Brave and the Bold</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> appeared in a new costume and also joined the ranks of the remorseless killers in Batman's rogues gallery. Editors and fans alike denounced this so hard, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> almost as it hit the shelves, and was even declared to happen on an alternate Earth not seen before or since. But Mego made its Catwoman figure based on this new costume, and in the age before endless variants were the norm, this was perhaps the only Catwoman figure made until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a> came out.
<ul><li> Costumes can be particularly vulnerable to this, if they're associated with a sufficiently iconic time. For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s very earliest appearances sometimes colored the yellow parts of the S-shield black and drew the symbol itself as more of a badge shape. By 1940, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> had largely ended and Superman's outfit was almost indistinguishable from the classic look.

In the actual comics, the two were only members of the Brotherhood for a handful of issues, and quickly defected after realizing what a monster Magneto actually was. They joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> in 1965, and have subsequently been heroes for the vast majority of their published existence.

This was the prime central fact of the character for two decades. 1987 saw his new series and his freedom, and while his status varies, as of the mid-2010s, this once-ubiquitous fact about the Surfer has been outdated longer than it was ever his premise.

Less than a year. It wasn't until 1994 that she was permanently resurrected and began appearing as a frequent player in the Marvel Universe.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonaldSearle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonaldSearle">Ronald Searle</a>'s fame as a cartoonist is still largely defined by his popular cartoon series <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/StTrinians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/StTrinians">St Trinians</a></em>. Yet in his long, long, long career which spanned almost half a century how long did <em>St Trinians</em> last as a series? Answer: <strong>Only four years!</strong> Even Searle himself had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a> over the fact that he was still first and foremost remembered for this series, even decades after he drew the final episode. Especially since he drew so many different cartoons and illustrations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpirit">The Spirit</a></em> is remembered as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillEisner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillEisner">Will Eisner</a>'s way of delivering thoughtful humanism and avant-garde storytelling every week from 1940 to 1952, but the time the comic actually fits that description is a lot shorter. Eisner was off fighting in WWII for most of the comic's early years and did not develop his distinctive experimental style until he returned in 1946, and by 1949 he had grown tired of <em>The Spirit</em> and left it in the hands of his staff for its final years. Most of the issues people remember come from that 1946-49 period, rather than from across the book's entire twelve-year run.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">The Dark Age of Comic Books</a> is usually associated with the entirety of the late 80s and the 90s, but its actual heyday was a fair bit shorter. Though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> is the most commonly given start date, it took a while for it to leak into general comics. The late 80s were still largely a continuation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">The Bronze Age of Comic Books</a>, with much of DC's work deliberately emulating Marvel's earlier output and Marvel under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter">Jim Shooter</a> mostly continuing what it did best. Most events from the era were straightforward big battles like <em>Acts of Vengeance</em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Legends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Legends">Legends</a></em>, with darker storylines confined to imprints like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics">Vertigo Comics</a>. The era's signature artstyle didn't start to dominate until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a>'s 1990 work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a></em>, and gimmick covers showed up at around the same time. Most of the iconic stories and events of the era, including the creation of Wizard Magazine, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death of Superman</a></em>, the foundation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a>, Jim Lee's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>'s departure, and a number of major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Ages</a>, happened during this period, which lasted about seven years. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatComicsCrashOf1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatComicsCrashOf1996">The Great Comics Crash of 1996</a>, the Dark Age was mostly dead on its feet, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesReborn">Heroes Reborn</a></em> underperforming and being widely mocked, and the explosive success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> and Howard Porter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">JLA</a></em> (which was very much a throwback to the bombastic, optimistic style of superhero tales from the Silver and Bronze Ages, albeit with a modern edge) the following year more or less sealed the deal.
</li><li> The much-hated "Teen Tony" era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>, where Tony Stark was killed off and replaced by a time-displaced younger version of himself, was much shorter than people remember. Teen Tony took over as the series lead in <em>Iron Man</em> #326, but the series was cancelled at #332 because of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Onslaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Onslaught">Onslaught</a></em> and the subsequent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HeroesReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HeroesReborn">Heroes Reborn</a></em> relaunch of the book, which once again starred an adult Tony.
<ul><li> Obadiah Stane, aka, Iron Monger, is one of the more memorable <em>Iron Man</em> villains. He was the first villain used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> film trilogy (as well as the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>), and had a recurring role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a>.</em> However, he was only around 37 issues before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a></span>, and he only donned the moniker of Iron Monger in only his final appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much everyone thinks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> as a high-schooler. This period lasted about 28 issues, a little over two years, after which he graduated. Early Marvel frequently averted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>, and Spider-Man was probably the biggest expression of that, visibly aging over the course of Lee's run from fifteen to his late teens or early twenties. This one likely owes itself to adaptations, which always start off with him in high school and often don't bother to age him up (including, ironically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, where he was still in high school 200 issues in).
</li><li> When Marvel changed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel">Carol Danvers'</a> codename from 'Ms Marvel' to 'Captain Marvel' in 2012, a number of fans complained about the sudden change to such a long-lasting character. In actuality, 'Ms Marvel' is only one of several names the character has used, having also used Binary and Warbird. 'Ms Marvel' was the name she first used when she became a superhero (in 1977, nine years after her initial debut in 1968), but her time as Binary (from 1982 to 1998, 16 years) and Warbird (1998 to 2006, 8 years), both lasted longer (Ms Marvel, in comparison, lasted less than 5 years initially, and when she resumed it in 2006, only lasted another 6 years). This, in turn, makes her name/costume changing a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>. The thing that muddies the waters is that for most of Carol's run as Binary, she just wasn't appearing in comics outside of occasional guest appearances in <em>Uncanny X-Men</em>, and even when she came back as Warbird in the Heroes Return era, she was a supporting character in the Kurt Busiek Avengers and Iron Man books.
</li><li> In a similar case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Spider-Woman</a> getting a costume redesign in 2014 lead to complaints about a drastic redesign of a costume that had gone unchanged for decades. Many were unaware that, while unchanged, the suit was <em>unused</em> for the bulk of the character's existence. In 1988 she had retired the name and costume, operating as simply 'Jessica Drew' and being a non-costumed superhero private investigator, starting 11 years after her debut. She wouldn't be depicted as Spider-Woman, at least in-canon, until another <em>21 years</em>, at least technically.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ti32');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ti32" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ti32');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In 2005, the character was revived as Spider-Woman, but this was revealed to have been a Skrull impostor four years later as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a> storyline, meaning the character's return to the Spider-Woman name wouldn't <em>really</em> happen until 2009.</span> The costume change was an attempt to reconnect her with her private investigator role, a place she occupied for <em>most of her existence</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em>: When the layperson thinks of Thor's primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, they think of Jane Foster. While it's true that the two have always had chemistry, the truth is that Jane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">ship was pretty much sunk</a> back in 1967, within Thor #136, where Odin's manipulation caused her to fail her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">Engagement Challenge</a> and be sent back to Earth with her and Thor having no memory of each other. After that, she married and had a child with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> named Dr. Kincaid and the two never really got back together again. Still, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thor2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thor2014">Thor (2014)</a></em> shows that Jane is still <em>very</em> bitter about what Odin did to her, and her infatuation with Thor actually caused the end of her marriage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a></em> is known for being the comic that launched the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a>'s career into the stratosphere, and it's often held as being the type of shallow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> fare that his other works are known for. Thing is, Liefeld's entire run of <em>X-Force</em> lasted a whole <em>nine</em> issues. After that, he left Marvel to form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a> alongside the other artists who quit, and began working on the series' even more infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood">Youngblood</a></em>. <em>X-Force</em> co-creator Fabian Nicieza would salvage the team by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable">Cable</a> leave while bringing back more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a> members, shift the series to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> tone with more emphasis on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, and when Cable returned, was retooled into the grumpy but likable father figure type he's known as today. Many other writers would take a crack at the X-Force team, with Rick Remender's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXForce">Uncanny X-Force</a></em> in particular being acclaimed as one of the best X-books of <em>any</em> title, which is in stark contrast to the perception of the series being nothing more than dark age excess.
</li><li> Considering how grandiose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">the Galactus Trilogy</a> tends to be in Marvel lore, it can be a little funny to hear that its name is literal: it was exactly three issues long. Arguably less, since the story is resolved partway through the final issue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a> also applies, as doing <em>any</em> kind of issue-to-issue story arc was a big deal back then. Compare that to the Ultimate Galactus Trilogy, which lasted fourteen issues spread across three miniseries.
</li><li> If people know two things about Roy Harper/Speedy/Red Arrow/Arsenal, it's that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>'s sidekick and he was addicted to heroin. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">massive number of storylines</a> to call back to the latter incident or have Roy struggle with being on the wagon might make you think it was pretty lengthy, similar to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Demon in a Bottle</a>" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Harry Osborn's</a> issues with addiction. It lasted exactly two issues, with Roy having his addiction introduced in the first issue and going cold-turkey in the second.

But specifically, the classic image of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>, i.e. — private-eyes in fedoras, glamorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtDeco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtDeco">Art Deco</a> interiors and exteriors is more or less a phenomenon of the early to mid-forties. The vast majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a>, featuring unglamorous and seedy working-class type characters and by the Mid-40s and fifties, many noir inspired by Italian neorealism and documentary films were actually trying to shoot on location and de-glamorize itself. Indeed, the French historian Raymond Borde said that this classic noir had become such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> and cliche, that it was parodied in the final number of an MGM Musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBandWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBandWagon">The Band Wagon</a></em>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie">Epic Movie</a> is often typified in people's minds by films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em> but that film was so expensive and such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> that most studio chiefs and observers saw it as a lucky shot and cited producer David O. Selznick's failures to repeat that phenomenon as case in point. The real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie">Epic Movie</a> craze began in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, many of them set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory">Hollywood History</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome">Ancient Grome</a>, with large sets and casts of thousands, and most of these films weren't made in Hollywood but in Rome's Cinecitta's studios.
</li><li> The classic "studio system" era lasted from 1929-1947. A antitrust decision handed down by the Supreme Court in 1948 stripped the studios of much of their influence and the Hollywood of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> was a very different decade. This was the decade of Brando and James Dean, when actors, directors and local distributors were no longer held in control by the major studios, where you had such cynical and cold films as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweetSmellOfSuccess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweetSmellOfSuccess">Sweet Smell of Success</a></em> and other censorship pushing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">Genre-Busting</a> directors like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelFuller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelFuller">Samuel Fuller</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasRay">Nicholas Ray</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyMann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyMann">Anthony Mann</a> who J.

</li><li> "Blockbuster" movies have not been particularly "cool" (as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">"popular", which is not quite the same thing</a>) for a long time now. Among some circles, they are still not cool. That said, if you were to believe some people's memories the entire quarter-century between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> (1975) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">9/11</a> was one long carnival of Hollywood hoopla and goofiness. In truth, the blockbuster mentality reigned unchallenged in Tinseltown for only about a decade or so after <em>Jaws</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Wars</a></em> (1977). Blockbuster mania only really swept in around 1984, which saw the beginning of several boffo franchises: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsCop">Beverly Hills Cop</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em> alongside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a> franchise, or the semi-successful attempt to continue the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982">Conan</a></em> franchise with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheDestroyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheDestroyer">Conan the Destroyer</a></em>. It was during the mid-to-late 1980s that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis">Sequelitis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch">The Merch</a> became cultural jokes, and the stock complaint that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks">"everything in the movies now is a sequel or a remake or an adaptation of something"</a> began to be heard. This "first" blockbuster Era began to fade in 1994, with an interim period of "indie" films <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em> before a second "blockbuster" era erupted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOughties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOughties">The Oughties</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, typified by superhero films and fantasy films.
</li><li> Despite a fifty-plus year career in film including some of the largest franchises of all time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a></em> only actually <em>directed</em> six films in his life: <em>THX 1138</em>, <em>American Graffiti</em>, the original <em>Star Wars</em>, and the prequel trilogy. He was also a co-writer for other two films of the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy. Every other film he was involved in was merely as an executive producer and/or general ideas guy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BelaLugosi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BelaLugosi">Bela Lugosi</a> will forever be known as the definitive onscreen actor of Count Dracula, which could easily lead one to assume that he appeared in that role in a great many films, but in reality he only did so twice (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931">Dracula</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbbottAndCostelloMeetFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbbottAndCostelloMeetFrankenstein">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a></em>). He was actually more associated with his frequent stage performances as the Count during his lifetime. For comparison, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a> played Dracula <em>nine</em> times. He was even rumored to have said that he would play Dracula again if someone would write a film adaptation true to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">original Stoker novel</a>... which of course no one did.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> series has a 60+ year history, the time period most fans regard as its golden age is actually pretty short. If we narrow it down to the period when all five "Fathers of Godzilla"- director Ishiro Honda, composer Akira Ifukube, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, special effects technician Eiji Tusburaya, and writer Shinichi Sekizawa -were consistently active and the films were consistently financial and critical hits, we end up with only <em>four</em> movies, released from 1962 to 1965- <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla">King Kong vs. Godzilla</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MothraVsGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MothraVsGodzilla">Mothra vs. Godzilla</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhidorahTheThreeHeadedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhidorahTheThreeHeadedMonster">Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfAstroMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfAstroMonster">Invasion of Astro-Monster</a></em> — ironically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gojira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gojira">first film</a> is not part of this era. After that, Honda and Ifukube became less involved in the series, the budgets began to decline rapidly due to Japanese audiences shunning the cinema in favor of color television, and Tsuburaya's unexpected death in 1970 dealt another big blow, and the original Godzilla run (that is, the Showa continuity) ended in a box office whimper with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorOfMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorOfMechagodzilla">Terror of Mechagodzilla</a></em>.
</li><li> The image of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> as the poncho-clad, cigar-smoking "Man With No Name" has become such a monolith of the western genre that a misconception has arisen that Eastwood played the character for decades in many different films, but in reality the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy">Dollars Trilogy</a> directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone">Sergio Leone</a> is the only time he played that exact role- three movies, three years. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HangEmHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HangEmHigh">Hang 'Em High</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighPlainsDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighPlainsDrifter">High Plains Drifter</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaleRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaleRider">Pale Rider</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em> are commonly mistaken as being additional chapters of the Man With No Name's mythical story (sometimes even the DVD packaging makes this claim) but Eastwood plays distinct characters in all of them.
</li><li> The "Hitchcock blonde" unleashes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">a perennial groan</a> from many Hitchcock scholars. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> had a career from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The '20s</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. Before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, the only real major blonde actress is <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnyOndra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnyOndra">Anny Ondra</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blackmail1929" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blackmail1929">Blackmail</a></em> made in 1929. In between, most of Hitchcock's leading ladies were black-haired or brunettes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylviaSidney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylviaSidney">Sylvia Sidney</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanFontaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanFontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridBergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeresaWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeresaWright">Teresa Wright</a>). It is only in the '50s that you see prominently blonde actresses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceKelly">Grace Kelly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNovak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNovak">Kim Novak</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaMarieSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaMarieSaint">Eva Marie Saint</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeraMiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeraMiles">Vera Miles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JanetLeigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JanetLeigh">Janet Leigh</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren">Tippi Hedren</a>) and as Hitchcock explained this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes">because blondes were popular</a> in the '50s, and as a mainstream film-maker, he more or less did reflect popular ongoing trends in his movies. Film scholars and at one point, Hitchcock himself, also pointed out all his characters are subversions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> stereotype.
</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals">The Little Rascals</a></em> series ran for over two decades (1922-44), the tremendously high cast turnover meant that entire lineups seldom lasted for more than a year. One reason the "classic" lineup of Spanky-Alfalfa-Buckwheat-Darla is so well-remembered is because all of them had long (and overlapping) tenures with <em>Our Gang</em>... but they still only formed the core ensemble for six years (1936-42).
</li><li> As for International and Non-Hollywood Cinema:
<ul><li> The montage era of Soviet cinema (typified by Eisenstein, Dovzhenko, Pudovkin, Vertov) was mainly and entirely a phenomenon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSovietTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSovietTwenties">The Soviet Twenties</a> and arguably had a bigger influence outside the USSR than at home. The era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThirties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThirties">The '30s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialistRealism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialistRealism">Socialist Realism</a> and High Stalinism, and most of the original avant-garde film-makers (like Vertov, Medvedkin) had been stifled and forced to make conventional films by that point.
</li><li> So-called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanExpressionism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanExpressionism">German Expressionism</a> is a phenomenon of the early to the middle-twenties. As film historians note, the end of this period was marked by the emergence of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity">Neue Sachlichkeit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (New Objectivity) which went for realism and doing away with the obvious symbolism and exaggerated sets of the early films, leading to films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PandorasBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PandorasBox">Pandora's Box</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastLaugh">The Last Laugh</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang">Fritz Lang</a> was himself bored with expressionism and his first two sound films, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/M" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/M">M</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTestamentOfDrMabuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTestamentOfDrMabuse">The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</a></em> were in a more realistic style. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">then the Nazis came</a> and most of the original German Expression masters, technicians and writers fled Germany for Hollywood. Many also point out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a> in the films of this time, the fact that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a></em> was partly shot on real-locations and that the only film that really typifies the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">The Theme Park Version</a> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinetOfDrCaligari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinetOfDrCaligari">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a></em>.

It feels longer because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact">of its immediate and sizable influence on film-makers in America, England and around the world</a>.

<ul><li> The famous "kissing in the surf" scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromHereToEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromHereToEternity">From Here to Eternity</a></em> has been parodied and homaged a dozen times or more. In the original, it's <em>three seconds long.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em> somehow has acquired the reputation of being a very long movie. In fact, it doesn't even hit the two-hour mark (just barely, though: it runs 119 minutes). This is actually more of a generational thing: many movies of the 1930s were less than 90 minutes long (some weren't even 80 minutes long), so <em>Kane</em> seemed interminable by comparison. <em>Kane</em> also covers nearly 70 years of history, so it definitely has an epic feel.
</li><li> The climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone</a></em>, from the clock striking to Harry getting hit with the shovel, lasts under fourteen minutes. This is also pretty much the only scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Marv and Harry</a> suffer any physical harm. From the way most people remember it and the massive amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">knockoffs featuring near-identical scenes</a>, you'd think the entire movie was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeAloneAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeAloneAntics">Kevin pranking the bandits</a>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">The sequel, on the other hand...</a>)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> is one of the more famous roles in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> — yet <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> is the only place he has the most screen time, only appearing briefly in one or two scenes in his other appearances (until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em>, where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">gets second billing and nearly as much screen time as the Good Captain herself</a>.)
</li><li> Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> winning an Oscar in the role, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HannibalLecter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HannibalLecter">Hannibal Lecter</a> doesn't appear in that many scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em>. In fact, it is said that Hopkins set a record for the actor winning Best Actor appearing in the least amount of time.
</li><li> Although most would describe the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> as "a dude's guardian angel shows him what the world would be like if he had never been born," this actually doesn't happen until the final half-hour of a film that runs 2 hours and 10 minutes. Most of the movie is actually just showing us all of the sacrifices that George has made during his life and where it has gotten him; his declaration that he wishes he was never born is essentially the beginning of the third act.
</li><li> A particularly thrilling action sequence in a film may be so memorable that it seems longer than its actual running time; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">an "epic" score on the soundtrack certainly helps</a>.
<ul><li> A good example is the tank chase through the desert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em>. It takes up eight minutes of screen time...but it's so momentous and packed with action (at one point the shots are alternating within a second or so of each other) that it seems twice as long.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em>, the iconic scene with the rolling boulder lasts <em>less than twenty seconds</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween">Halloween</a></em> series is often remembered as about Michael Myers hunting his sister, Laurie. However, the revelation that she was his sister was completely absent from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">original film</a>, and was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> in the last fifteen minutes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981">second film</a>. Laurie was then absent for the next three movies, returned as a main character in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater">seventh movie</a> (by which time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> had aged 20 years), to be killed off at the beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenResurrection">eighth</a>. So, <em>H20</em> is the only film in the original series in which the brother/sister dynamic was prominent, although it was played to full effect in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween2007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween2007">the remake</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII2009">its sequel</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> Marty's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">Iconic Outfit</a> with the "life preserver" vest only ever appears in Part I, and even then he doesn't don the vest until about 15 minutes into the movie. Similarly, Doc's iconic yellow 2015 garb is only seen in the last scene of Part I and the first scene of Part II, for maybe a grand total of 15 minutes.
</li><li> The DeLorean's famous OUTATIME license plate is only seen on the car for a few minutes, and gets knocked off during the first time travel experiment. It stays off the car for the rest of the movie, and is replaced by an orange barcode license plate (from 2015) in the sequels.
</li><li> The DeLorean is famously remembered for flying, but only ever flew during Part II (aside from the ten second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> gag at the end of Part I). For the majority of Part I and the entirety of Part III, it's grounded.
</li><li> Marty's rival Needles only appears during two brief scenes in the entire trilogy, and only during the sequel movies.
</li><li> The mall and the Libyans only appear in Part I, and are not referenced again in the sequels.
</li><li> Marty's pink hoverboard from 2015 is regarded as a quintessential icon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> (as depicted in a second season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs">The Goldbergs</a></em>). However, Part II came out on November 22, 1989, meaning that hoverboards were in the public awareness for only the last <em>40 days</em> of the decade.

Yet according to the romance novel industry, at least half of England's peerage and gentry must have gotten married during this time.
</li><li> A stereotypical parody/homage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> will feature Harry and friends attending Hogwarts while at the same time a corporeal Lord Voldemort is openly fighting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. These things only happen at the same time in <em>one</em> of the seven books, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>. Interestingly, some parodies featuring this, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PotterPuppetPals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PotterPuppetPals">Potter Puppet Pals</a></em>, actually predate the publication of <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>. The main reason it exists is that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em> had featured Voldemort's resurrection, leaving audiences three years to assume that the obvious next step was open warfare until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em> featured him undercover and infiltrating the Ministry. Furthermore, few people guessed that the final book in the series, two years after <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>, would feature Harry mostly away from Hogwarts. Because of these factors, "corporeal Voldemort openly battles Harry at school" remained the common assumption of what the next book would be about for seven years, in a series that went on for ten - while the parody was only realized once, the assumption behind it had been around for most of the series's lifespan.

The fact that its predominately in a two-parter format for most of the series enabled the series have 120 episodes, far more than enough for a suitable syndication package that can last 24 weeks of syndication stripped weekday broadcasts and thus be viable for reruns for years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> is the best-known <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> series, but it was also the shortest-lived of the five live-action <em>Trek</em> series, staying on the air for less than three years (September 1966 to June 1969).

<ul><li> Also, the fact that its famous "five-year mission" apparently lasted long enough to include a virtually limitless number of stories from television, books, comics, etc. In this case it helps that the end (and the <em>beginning</em>, for that matter) of the five-year mission has never been depicted in canon - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> picks up some years after the end of it.

</li><li> The infamous haircut which bears Rachel's name lasted for barely more than a season - the last few episodes of season one and all of season two. Jennifer Aniston <em>hated</em> the hairstyle and started wearing her hair differently in the third season.
</li><li> Ross and Rachel are a proper couple for just about a year out of the show's ten-season run: after a couple of false starts, they get together for real at the end of "The One with the Prom Video" (aired February 1, 1996) and break up in "The One with the Morning After" (aired February 20, 1997). By contrast, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a> Chandler and Monica are together for a full six seasons (starting in the fourth season finale).
</li><li> All three of the above overlap with each other, but for an even <em>more</em> brief span: the second half of the second season, or just <em>ten</em> episodes out of 236<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35kxp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35kxp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35kxp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">we're not going to count them as a couple in "The One with the Prom Video", that's just silly</span>. That this stretch of episodes is considered the very height of the show's golden age is probably no coincidence.

</li><li> Speaking of Frasier, much is made of his relationship with Diane - he is introduced as her new boyfriend, after all, and she leaves him at the altar - to the point that he consistently remembers her as one of the great loves of his life on <em>Frasier</em>; she even merits a guest appearance in that capacity alongside his two ex-wives and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">his mother</a>). They were only together for a single season (3). By contrast, Frasier starts dating Lilith in the following season and their relationship lasts for the better part of eight seasons (4-11)... on the other hand, given Frasier's predilection for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a> on his own show, it's very possible Diane <em>is</em> one of the longest-lasting relationships he's ever had.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jack Bauer's time as an official CTU agent only lasts for the show's first three seasons. After the third season he is fired from CTU, and is only specially commissioned for the day each season afterwards, with the exception of Season 7 where CTU isn't even involved. Even his tenure as CTU agent doesn't last through the entire three seasons, as during Season 2 he had resigned following <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wife's murder</span> and was specially brought because of the circumstances much like the case of post-Season 3 seasons.
</li><li> Aside from Jack, the core cast everyone associates with the show is Kim Bauer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler, President David Palmer, Chloe O'Brian, Bill Buchanan, and Curtis Manning. There's only one season in which all seven characters appear: the fifth. And even then, not all of them appear throughout the entire season's run: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Michelle Dessler and David Palmer</span> are both killed in the fifth season premiere, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tony Almeida</span> only appeared in a handful of episodes in the first half of the season before dying at the beginning of the second half (although the death would later be retconned in future seasons). Kim had also left the series by the end of the third season and appeared in two episodes in the middle of season five in a guest appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> Everyone remembers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharliesAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharliesAngels">Charlie's Angels</a></em> as starring Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith. Except this lineup lasted for just <em>one</em> of the show's five seasons: Fawcett left after season 1 and was replaced by Cheryl Ladd. Despite seeing out the remainder of the show's run, Ladd has remained in Fawcett's shadow ever since (it didn't help that Fawcett was the only Angel to return for guest appearances after departing). In fact, only one of the three original Angels (Jaclyn Smith) remained part of the series for its entire run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a></em> ran as a stand-alone sitcom for just one season (1955-56) of 39 episodes, and it is these episodes which are the only ones to appear in syndication. However, the Honeymooners characters enjoyed a much longer life as a recurring sketch on Jackie Gleason's shows, starting with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuMont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuMont">DuMont</a> program <em>Cavalcade of Stars</em> in 1951. He brought them over with him to CBS for <em>The Jackie Gleason Show</em> in 1952, which ran for three seasons. An hour-long variety series, by the 1954-55 season, most episodes of <em>The Jackie Gleason Show</em> were mostly (or even entirely!) comprised of a <em>Honeymooners</em> sketch, which inspired Gleason to attempt making a proper sitcom out of it. He decided it was a failed experiment after its one and only season and revived <em>The Jackie Gleason Show</em> for one more season in 1956-57, with more <em>Honeymooners</em> sketches. Gleason would revive the format occasionally as late as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, but most <em>Honeymooners</em> sketches and specials which aired after 1957 were either remakes or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode">musical episodes</a> (and sometimes both!). However, the core cast lineup of Gleason-Carney-Meadows-Randolph lasted only from 1952 to 1957, with Randolph never again returning to play Trixie Norton after that (although Alice was recast for the show's return in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, Audrey Meadows did reprise her role as Alice in several one-off specials in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>).
</li><li> Perhaps due to its influence on popular culture and for how many television remakes it inspired (as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie">a movie</a>), many seem to remember the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959">The Twilight Zone (1959)</a></em> as having run longer than its five seasons (1959-64).

</li><li> No matter how you slice it, the golden age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a>, the most influential genre of popular music in the 20th century, lasted for less than the length of one US presidential administration: it started with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle">Blackboard Jungle</a></em> on March 25, 1955, and ended, at the <em>latest</em>, on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">The Day The Music Died</a>: February 3, 1959 - less than four years. Many commentators in fact peg the start of the decline of rock and roll music earlier: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JerryLeeLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JerryLeeLewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> marrying his cousin (May 1958), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> being drafted into the army (March 1958), or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleRichard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleRichard">Little Richard</a>'s religious conversion and retirement from secular music (October 1957, barely <em>six months</em> after his album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeresLittleRichard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeresLittleRichard">Here's Little Richard</a></em> was released). It was well and truly over by the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry">Chuck Berry</a> was arrested and several key figures in the genre (including Alan Freed, the man who <em>coined</em> the term "rock and roll") were brought down in a payola scandal.
<ul><li> Similarly, the notion of rock and roll being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">"the Devil's music"</a>, which supposedly dominated the 1950s, was, in historical terms, over almost as soon as it began. Barely more than two years after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle">Blackboard Jungle</a></em>, on April 10, 1957, Ricky Nelson performed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatsDomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatsDomino">Fats Domino</a>'s "I'm Walkin'" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfOzzieAndHarriet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfOzzieAndHarriet">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a></em>, signalling that rock and roll had fully entered the mainstream. While parents still didn't like rock music after that, they understood that, if Ozzie and Harriet could give it their stamp of approval, it must not be a social menace after all, and were at least able to tolerate it. That said, it made a comeback during the Satanic Panic (mostly in the '80s and '90s) and continues in some areas even to this day.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>'s music career lasted a year and a half until his death in a plane crash.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSexPistols">The Sex Pistols</a>, credited with starting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> movement, were together initially for only 2½ years, produced four singles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">one album</a>.

</li><li> If you view the releases of the debut album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ramones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ramones">Ramones</a></em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling">London Calling</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a> as the bookends of the classic punk era, it lasted just 44 months (April 1976 to December 1979). And since punk rock didn't gain mainstream-media attention until late 1977 at the earliest, the era was effectively even shorter.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s mainstream popularity lasted about 2½ years before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a>'s suicide ended the band. After Cobain's death the popularity of the band rose to even greater levels. Their posthumous releases easily outnumber the releases they made when he was alive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanesAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanesAddiction">Jane's Addiction</a> lasted only 6 years in its original, and most influential incarnation. Their only pre-major label release was their self-titled live album in 1987. Their two critically acclaimed and influential albums, <em>Nothing's Shocking</em> and <em>Ritual de lo Habitual</em>, were released within the next few years, right before calling it quits on top of their popularity and influence in 1991. The breakup tour served as a foundation of the Lollapalooza festival.
</li><li> The Lollapalooza tour lasted only 6 years in its original incarnation, due to Perry Farrell abandoning the project owing to growing disillusionment in 1996 following the addition of Music/Metallica, the relative decline of alternative music, and also the Lilith Fair stealing a good deal of the buzz.
</li><li> Considering how strongly associated they are with the subject, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> only sang about surfing from November 1961 to July 1963 (less than two years). The main reason it lasted that long at all was because Capitol Records and Murry Wilson constantly urged them for new material and they wrote new songs on the subject to pad out the three albums they did in that period (most evident on the second album <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SurfinUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SurfinUSA">Surfin USA</a></em>). Even though they have been widely recognised as mature artists since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds">Pet Sounds</a></em>, they're still viewed by the general public as Those Guys Who Did Songs About Surfing And Cars.
</li><li> The "classic" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> released three original albums (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AppetiteForDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AppetiteForDestruction">Appetite for Destruction</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UseYourIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UseYourIllusion">Use Your Illusion</a></em> twins), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum">Cover Album</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GNRLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GNRLies">a compilation mixing an EP with some new songs</a> before the band was effectively over, yet similar to the Nirvana example they have been treated like they went on for years.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco">Disco</a>'s heyday was just a flash, it didn't enter the mainstream until 1974 and it wasn't until late 1977 that most hits associated it with it came out along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaturdayNightFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaturdayNightFever">Saturday Night Fever</a></em>. Disco Demolition Night meanwhile was in July 1979 just less than two years later, and by the end of 1980 it had all but faded entirely (only in the US, of course).
</li><li> The era of "classic rock" - defined here as all non-psychedelic, non-metal, non-"alternative" hard rock of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> - began on April 16, 1964 with the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' first album and ended on October 28, 1977 with the release of <em>Never Mind the Bollocks</em> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles">Eagles</a>' <em>Hotel California</em>, released ten months before <em>Bollocks</em>, is perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnEra">the last truly great album of the classic era</a>. That's 162 months - less than 20 percent of the entire span of time between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">the bombing of Hiroshima</a> and now. But you'd be forgiven for thinking that era lasted until the 1990s or even later, judging by the continuous lionizing and pop-cultural appropriation of the classic bands for decades afterward - not to mention the condemnation and even outright ignoring of post-1977 hard rock by much of the mainstream music media.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream">Cream</a> lasted from July 1966 to November 1968, but produced four studio albums, one a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctDoubleAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctDoubleAlbum">Distinct Double Album</a> with a live disc, the other a posthumously released album also partially recorded live, and a number of posthumous live releases. However, in that time, they became one of the most influential bands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> in his lifetime only managed to produce three studio albums (one a double disc), several standalone tracks released as singles, an album of live-recorded originals with Band Of Gypsys, and a large catalogue of unreleased and unfinished material, live recordings, demos, runthroughs, rehearsals, jam sessions, session work, sittings-in with various artists, alternate takes, etc. which still (as of December 2013) have yet to be fully unearthed and released. And his highly influential and revolutionary career as an artist in his own right only lasted from September 1966-September 1970; his last official album release came out in 1969. And that's not counting his pre-Experience career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> lasted only five years, 1967 to 1972. And yet this was enough for an acclaimed and extremely productive period where the group recorded <em>six albums in three years</em> (their self-titled debut in '68, three the following year, and two in 1970), after which Tom Fogerty left, and the band's attempt at surviving as a three-piece didn't stick.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s star-making stage persona Ziggy Stardust came and went in less than two years. He toured as Ziggy from January 29, 1972 to July 3, 1973, during which time the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AladdinSane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AladdinSane">Aladdin Sane</a></em> albums were released. By the end of 1973, he'd jettisoned his Spiders from Mars backing band, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion">The British Invasion</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum">Cover Album</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinUps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinUps">Pin Ups</a></em> and the <em>1980 Floor Show</em> TV special featuring them, and while the Ziggy <em>look</em> persisted for a while afterward, by the 1974 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiamondDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiamondDogs">Diamond Dogs</a></em> tour he'd left that behind too.
<ul><li> Even shorter-lived than Ziggy is the Thin White Duke persona, even though Bowie's post-glitter career is often equated with it. The Duke was created for the barely LP length <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StationToStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StationToStation">Station to Station</a></em> and Bowie toured in character for a few months. Then he moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Berlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Berlin">Berlin</a> to clean up from his prodigious drug use, effectively starting the next phase.
</li></ul></li><li> They've now got major legs - perhaps forever, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">until the group's core members die</a> - thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a> were at the top of the rock-music charts for a relatively short time. They didn't gain a mass fanbase until late 1975, hit the peak of their popularity in the summer of 1977, and were already slumping by 1979. Since then, they've had only scattered success as recording artists, notably <em>Lick It Up</em> in 1983 and <em>Psycho Circus</em> in 1998.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground">Velvet Underground</a> are widely considered to be one of the most influential bands of all time, being considered a significant precursor to both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a>, as well as being one of the first bands to address taboo topics such as drug addiction, prostitution, and societal oppression of transgender people. Despite this level of influence, the band stuck around for less than a decade, spanning from 1964 to 1973. Even then, the tail end of their run was spent as the Velvet Underground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>, being relatively inactive save for one final album that was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">a Doug Yule solo album</a> with the band name slapped on for contractual reasons. The general consensus is that Lou Reed's departure in 1970, just six years into the band's run, marked the de-facto demise of the Velvet Underground.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanisJoplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanisJoplin">Janis Joplin</a> recorded four albums in three years—two with Big Brother and the Holding Company, and two as a solo artist. She became a star with the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and was dead three years later.
</li><li> That most 1980s of pop-music styles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a>, more or less corresponded to the stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">Eighties</a> decade itself (see below). Its beginning is often marked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot">Quiet Riot</a>'s release of <em>Metal Health</em> in 1983 (although QR were arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">less the first of the hair bands than they were the last of the "arena-rock" bands</a> a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>). Due in part to a lull period in 1985 (MTV had largely cut back on metal, for instance), its uprising started in 1986, with "Home Sweet Home" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> codifying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi">Bon Jovi</a> putting the genre on the map with the release of <em>Slippery When Wet</em>. The genre's peak lasted until 1988, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a>' topped the charts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstruction</a> of the hair lifestyle, <em>Appetite For Destruction</em>. While the subgenre continued to be popular until about 1991 or so (and for that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">there were songs from as early as 1975-1976 that could pass for Hair Metal</a>), after 1988, which also marked the release of the film <em>The Decline of Western Civilization II</em>, it was very hard to take the hair scene seriously anymore.
</li><li> "New Wave" music manages to be both this <em>and</em> Longer Than They Think. Many people are not aware that the style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">developed surprisingly early</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, there are some <em>very</em> '80s-sounding songs out there that are actually from 1978 or 1979. On the other hand, the New Wave craze did not last until the end of the '80s; by 1986 it was already pretty old-hat and by 1988 had almost disappeared from the charts entirely. Depending on your definition, you could say it began either in July ‎1979 after Disco Demolition Night or in August 1981 with the debut of MTV.
<ul><li> Going even further, one could claim that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of new wave was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDUFaRiUwsk">Machines by Lothor and the Hand People.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> And going the other direction, the New Wave sound is present in Soho's "Hippychick" from 1990 (which samples from The Smiths).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision">Joy Division</a> were only around for three years (owing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>) in which they produced a mere two albums, and yet they more or less invented the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a> genre, paved the way for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothRock">Goth Rock</a> while they were at it, and served as an enormous influence on innumerable artists in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> genre and beyond. For only one of those three years did they gain any mainstream media attention, beginning with part of an NME magazine cover in January 1979, through to May 1980, were featured briefly on a few television guest spots, and only gigged outside of the UK on a few occasions; their 1979 tour was <em>supporting</em> Buzzcocks, and the last ever show being in a university student union.
</li><li> The unbelievably influential proto-punk band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewYorkDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewYorkDolls">New York Dolls</a> only existed in a meaningful sense from 1971-75 and only released two proper albums and a couple albums of demo material. The band reunited in 2004, but the bassist, Arthur Kane, died shortly after the reunion, leaving only two surviving members: David Johansen (singer) and Sylvain Sylvain (rhythm guitar). During their brief career, the New York Dolls inspired everyone from The Sex Pistols to Motley Crue, and without them, it's safe to say that punk and glam would look very different.
</li><li> Despite existing, albeit with temporary breakups, since 1979 and arguably pioneering the black and thrash metal subgenres <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Venom">Venom</a> was only impactful for about 2 years. <em>Welcome to Hell</em> from 1981 and <em>Black Metal</em> a year later influenced countless bands in North America and Europe to turn up the speed and brutality of their music and by 1983 the more experimental <em>At War with Satan</em> and <em>Possessed</em>, while still appreciated in the underground, were considered inferior to what Bay Area, Swedish and German scenes were producing. The classic Cronos, Mantas, Abaddon lineup broke up in 1986, lasting only six years.
</li><li> The "dead period" of the harpsichord where it became obsolete and a forgotten instrument only lasted about 30 years, although one could argue that this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope">never happened as popularly imagined</a>. In fact the early harpsichord revival efforts and the last uses of the harpsichord in contemporary popular music actually <em>overlapped</em> by at least two decades as its use in basso continuo and bass recitative were still common enough for those interested in the harpsichord to take notice. If anything, it's analogous to what happened with the piano in the 80s, 90s, and 00s with it being supplanted by the keyboard synthesizer in popular music and sometimes even classical music and in schools. However, the piano never was in true danger of being a forgotten instrument, and the beginnings of revival are being seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.
</li><li> The "hip-hop chic" period of the 00s where the charts were dominated by rap and hip-hop only lasted from late 2003 until summer of 2007. 2007-2009 was dominated by a danceable form of electropop by artists like Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, and Rihanna. 2000-2003 were a continuation of late 90s trends like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal">Nu Metal</a>, boy bands, and upbeat bubblegum pop. 2001-2003 saw a rise in patriotic music due to 9/11.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em> devotes Books 9-12 of a twenty-four-book epic to the part of Odysseus's journey between him leaving Troy and him washing up on the shores of Ogygia. This entire narrative is a single flashback and contains nearly all of the iconic events of the story: the Lotus Eaters, the Cyclops, the Land of the Dead, Scylla and Charybdis, Circe, Aeolus, and so on. Most retellings of the story stretch it from one-sixth of the story to about 80% of it.
</li><li> Scholarly consensus on Jesus of Nazareth is that he started preaching and gained followers in his early to mid thirties and died somewhere around that same age. All in all the time Jesus went around preaching with his disciples cannot have lasted more than a few years - if that.
</li><li> The Babylonian exile in the Old Testament, where the Jews were forcibly deported from Judah and the First Temple destroyed, is portrayed as hugely symbolic event, and their eventual return home is presented as something long-waited for. The exile, based on the Biblical dates, only lasted about 50 years. The Biblical prophet most associated with the exile, Daniel, was already a young man when Jerusalem fell, and most of the most well-known parts of his story (such as his time in the lions' den) take place <em>after</em> the end of the exile (Daniel chose not to return to Jerusalem). However, if modern biblical scholarship and theology is to be believed, this overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact">Short-Lived Big Impact</a> as many biblical texts have likely been written/edited/composed during that phase and some even say that the exile was the moment when Judaism finally converted from a polytheistic religion with El/JHWH as the highest god to one with JHWH as the <em>only</em> god, no "JHWH and his wife Ashera" and no "JHWH and Baal" any more.

<ul><li> The "Attitude Era" was relatively brief, lasting almost exactly five years. It's often cited as the phenomenon that epitomized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, although the first stirrings of the Attitude Era didn't occur until the decade was more than half over.

</li><li> Speaking of the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, despite being one of the biggest, if not <em>the</em> biggest, wrestling superstar of all time, his entire in-ring career from start to stop spanned less than 14 years, barely half of which were actually wrestled as his iconic "Stone Cold" character.
</li><li> In his autobiography <em>Controversy Creates Cash</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> brags that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">regularly beat</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">WWE Raw</a></em> in the Nielsen ratings.

While one could argue that the first strike was the "Sega Does What Nintendon't" campaign in 1990, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> was still toiling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainstreamObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainstreamObscurity">Mainstream Obscurity</a> until the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> in June of 1991.

The war began to subside as early as 1994 and was pretty much over by 1996, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> doing poorly in the market and the release of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> in 1995.
</li><li> Sega as a video game company with its own console is also briefer than you'd suspect. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> was released in Japan in October 1985 (as the Sega Mark III; the Master System wasn't released in the US until 1986, and in turn Sega redesigned the Mark III as the Master System for Japan in 1987) and they announced the end of the Dreamcast in early 2001. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note57ics');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note57ics" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note57ics');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sega did have an earlier console than the Master System, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000">SG-1000<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> SG-what? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity">Exactly</a>. </span> It's not long until Sega will have been out of the market for consoles longer than they were a major player in it. Its' time as a major frontrunner and competitor is even shorter. The Genesis/Mega Drive (1989-1994ish) might be the only period in which Sega was a clearly dominant player in the American industry. Before and after then, it was basically fighting for scraps as a distant second or third (first with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari">Atari</a> over Nintendo's scraps, then with Nintendo over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a>'s scraps).

However, because Disney never acknowledged the show ending and promoted it as much as series that were still in production, many fans believe it ran until at least 2006 (not helped by the show having a crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></em> at same year).

It's not uncommon for people to assume that what they've seen of <em>Wallace and Gromit</em> is just a few episodes of a lengthy TV series, as opposed to most or all of their output. Of course, Aardman has an excuse on top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity">British Brevity</a>: stop-motion is hard.
</li><li> Most people know <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> as "that show where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">Kenny</a> dies in every episode." After Season 5, however, the writers generally kill him off once a season at most, discounting the three episodes in Season 14 where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">the gag was revisited</a>. Kenny died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a> for only a quarter of the show's total run, and this was phased out before certain other show staples <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">were introduced</a>.
<ul><li> Furthermore, people also associate the show with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Cartman</a> being a total sociopath, Stan puking on his girlfriend, and the boys going to Chef for advice.

How many episodes did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam">The Team</a> consist solely of these six? <em>Thirteen</em>. When it first started, the Team only consisted of the first four, with the latter two not joining until subsequent episodes. Specifically, Artemis didn't join the Team until join until Episode 6, and Episode 19 saw the next member join: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a>, with Red Arrow and Rocket joining in subsequent episodes.

The core lineup has never been the same, and only thirteen out of a current <em>seventy-two</em> episodes featured this.

<ul><li> While it had enormous influence on the world due to having come around during the age of industrialization, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">The British Empire</a> was only the world superpower for about a hundred years - from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to roughly the Treaty of Versailles in 1920. The United States had surpassed them economically nearly three decades prior to that, but the Treaty of Versailles and America's quick and massive intervention in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>'' combined with how effectively they were able to throw their weight around at the treaty negotiations (as well as the fact that Britain was heavily indebted to them to pay for said war) pretty much confirmed for everyone that British primacy was dead. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 was the final nail in the coffin. By comparison the Achaemenid Persian Empire ruled over a quarter of the world's population for about 200 years, the Roman Empire was dominant in Europe and MENA for about 700 years (roughly from Caesar's death to the Arab conquest of Egypt), the Chinese Han dynasty ruled most of East Asia for over 400 years, and the Ming dynasty did the same for over 250.
</li><li> While the city of Babylon had been in existence for thousands of years, the Chaldean Neo-Babylonian Empire only lasted from 612-539 B.C., and the empire was already in considerable decline for a number of years before it fell. Barring things from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a>, the entirety of what popular culture considers "Ancient Babylon" — including the Hanging Gardens, Ishtar Gate, etc. — all came from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (reigned c. 605-562 BC). After he died, it all went to seed.
</li><li> Classical Greece: While Greece has a history of thousands of years, almost all of the non-mythical people and events that the average person can name are from 500 to 300 B.C. This includes the rise of Athenian "democracy", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrecoPersianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrecoPersianWars">Greco-Persian Wars</a> (when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> is set), and the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>. Most of the ancient writers whose texts have survived to the present day (excluding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer">Homer</a>) had overlapping lifespans. The United States has already been a republic for longer than Athens was a democracy. This might be from a tendency by the average person to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome">conflate Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome</a> (the latter of which <em>did</em> go on for quite some time). Another factor may be people lumping in the Heroic Age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, when the stories of Perseus, Heracles, the Trojan War, etc. are set. This setting seems to correspond to the Late Bronze Age, and is thus separated from the Classical period by the centuries-long Archaic period, which gets little play in media despite it being when many famous aspects of Greece's history and culture originated: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer">Homer</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a>, etc.
</li><li> The "Seven Wonders of the Ancient World" were simultaneously intact for 21 years, 247-226 BC. The Colossus of Rhodes in particular was an intact statue for 66 years and a pile of rubble for 880 years.
</li><li> Rome is not free of this either. For example, almost every Roman soldier in fiction will wear <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorica_segmentata">Lorica Segmentata<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a type of armor that was used from roughly 20 to 300 AD. Compare it with what legionaries wore in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/0005cimbri.jpg">Samnite Wars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (4th century BC), <a class="urllink" href="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/0006cimbri.jpg">Punic Wars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (264-146 BC) and the <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/y5rxt9N.png">late empire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (300-450 AD). The late Roman Army was in fact very "Medieval" looking, with a lot more reliance on cavalry hailing from stone fortresses than on the famed legions of earlier periods. In general, fictional depictions of Rome tend to be concentrated on the very late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">Republic</a> or the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">Empire</a>. Most Roman Epics were set between about 70 BC (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus">Spartacus</a></em>) and about 50 AD (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em>). A very brief period considering the whole history from the founding of the Republic to the fall of the Empire in the West (and longer if you count the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Eastern Empire</a>, which continued for another <em>millennium</em>).
</li><li> It is entirely possible that the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustus (born 460 AD) lived to see Belisarius retake Rome in 535 AD. He would be 75 and the intermediate period of barbarian rule was only 59 years. Unfortunately, there is not much surviving documentation from that period and any supposedly relating to Romulus Augustus is doubtful at best.
</li><li> The Byzantine Empire's reconquest of the lost Western Provinces of Italy, North Africa, and Southern Spain under Justinian in the mid-6th Century is widely viewed as its historical high point, and the closest it came to the restoration of Rome's supreme dominance. This lasted only a few decades, and the empire never really recovered from the early Muslim conquests in the early-to-mid-7th Century. Compare <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Justinian555AD.png">the imperial borders under Justinian in 555<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Byzantiumby650AD.svg">those, in 650, just under a century later<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A lot of people get the wrong impression that Muslim Spain was only the Caliphate of Córdoba (or even worse, the Kingdom of Granada) and as a result think that it was a splendid, unified, and tolerant state during the whole period of 800 years between Tariq ibn Ziyah's invasion and the Christian conquest of Granada. In reality, the Caliphate itself only existed between 929 and 1031, and it was downright decadent from 976. Before 929 it was an emirate, not as powerful or splendorous for most of its existence as in the Caliphal period (and quite a bit chaotic during its first decades of existence, by the way), and after 1031 it dissolved into petty statelets that were controlled from time to time by their Christian or (North African) Muslim neighbours and life could be quite nasty there sometimes. The 'Reconquista' itself could be considered another example of this trope, as it actually ended <em>de facto</em> in the 1250s when Ferdinand III of Castile conquered the entire Guadalquivir Valley and Granada became a Castilian protectorate.
</li><li> Many of the classic elements commonly associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a> such as plate armor, longswords, infrequent bathing, etc. were only around in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges">The Late Middle Ages</a>. Even worse, some things associated with the Middle Ages are actually from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a>. For instance, European witch-hunting peaked during the Renaissance, not the Middle Ages.
</li><li> As with the above entry with ancient Rome and her legions, many themes, tropes, and concepts we associate with Sengoku Japan and the samurai caste came during the final years of the period when Japan was in the process of being unified. In particular, samurai weaponry and armour-especially those associated so much with Japan in popular culture such as the katana-did not exist for much of the feudal period. Not only did weapons and armour vastly differ from period to period, the Japanese even wielded weapons that we would consider foreign to their culture such as sword-and-spear combinations and later musket rifles. A good many of the associated tropes and customs of the samurai, such as bushido, did not even come into being until the advent of Imperial Japan and they were created in the first place to foster the Japanese identity.
<ul><li> Almost all fiction on Feudal Japan mostly focuses on the reign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuPeriod">Sengoku Jidai</a> had already begun several hundred years before, and Nobunaga and Ieyasu were relatively minor figures until near their old age. There were hundreds of other Japanese politicians, soldiers, and clan leaders who lived before the climax of Nobunaga and Ieyasu's military careers, who played just as important roles (and many were in the same ballpark in terms of competence). However, pop culture in Japan gives excessive attention to these two figures who had relatively brief reigns that lasted less than half their lifetimes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mongol Empire, the greatest land empire the world has ever seen, didn't last very long. It started from the coronation of Temujin as Genghis Khan in 1208 (died 1227), reached its high-water mark in 1254 under Möngke, and began to disintegrate after his death in 1259. The last accepted Great Khan, Kublai, proved to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">a weak ruler and an alcoholic</a>, and after his death in 1294, the Mongol empire was no more. The successor states lingered on for some generations.
<ul><li> It should also be stressed that Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole Mongol Empire in his lifetime, but "merely" Mongolia, northern China, and the former Soviet Central Asia. Southern China, Korea, Persia, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, and Eastern Europe would be conquered under his successors. The map of the Mongol Empire stretching from Bulgaria to Guangdong that most are familiar with was an incarnation that existed for at most about three decades- and technically never existed as a unified state (Song China's last remnants were subdued in 1279, and the Mongol civil wars and de facto split started in 1262).
</li></ul></li><li> Out of over a hundred years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a> (1337-1453), most plays, films etc. focus on Henry V's Agincourt campaign (1415), Joan of Arc's active involvement (1429-1430, 15 months) and her trial (1431, 3 months).
</li><li> For most of their existence, the Aztecs did not have an empire. They were vassals of other Nahua cities up to 1428 and only began to expand in the 1440s. Thus, when the Spaniards showed up in 1519, the Aztec Empire was less than 100 years old and many of its provinces had been held for less than 20 years. Most of the men who fought for Cortés were rival natives looking for a rematch.
</li><li> Similarly the Inca Empire, Tawantinsuyu, was also less than 100 years old (14381533), having entered a period of rapid expansion which was going on just before the Spaniards showed up, put on hold as they entered a civil war over who would be Sapa Inca (caused by an epidemic of smallpox that beat the Spanish). As a result, once Pizarro was able to capture Atauhualpa (many spelling variations), who had recently won (and ordered his opponent, Huascar, killed) and decided to kill him, they were able to lead many natives against the remaining Inca leadership. This shouldn't be surprising because the Pizarro brothers were distant cousins of Cortés and they were deliberately emulating him.
</li><li> Christoper Columbus's first voyage across the Atlantic only took a little longer than a month, which isn't very long at all for a sea voyage. It's often assumed to be longer because his crew was on the verge of mutiny; however this was due to the crushing psychological effect of them spending an entire month out of sight of land, and that Columbus lied to them about how far out to sea they were. Another source of confusion is that Columbus sailed from <em>continental</em> Spain on August 3 and landed in San Salvador on October 12; the first month was spent mostly in the Canary Islands, where he was forced to stop for repairs and remained until September 6.
</li><li> The American (i.e. USA) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirteenAmericanColonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirteenAmericanColonies">Colonial Period</a> can count as well. Discounting earlier Spanish settlements in Florida and the Rio Grande valley (as US schoolbook history tends to), the era lasted from the founding of the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown in 1607, until the official end of the Revolutionary War in 1783. For those keeping score, that's 176 years. By contrast, Mexico was a Spanish colony for exactly 300 years, Cuba for nearly 400, and Bermuda has been a British colony for even longer than that.
<ul><li> Also, for most of colonial American history, there were fewer colonies than the thirteen that broke away from Britain in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>. Georgia, the youngest of the original colonies, was founded in 1733, a mere 42 years before the Revolution started. At the time of independence, its founder, James Oglethorpe, was still alive, as were many of the original settlers. There's a reason that most of the South were Loyalists right up to the end of the war.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveGalley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveGalley">Boats rowed by slaves</a> were first used <em>en masse</em> in the Mediterranean by the Knights Hospitaller after they relocated to Malta in 1530, as a way to spam ships and rebuild their navy following the loss of their main base in Rhodes. Despite common belief, ancient and medieval oarsmen were free, professional soldiers. The number of slave galleys began to decline in the 17th century, when the Barbary pirates changed out their galleys for smaller, sail-only xebecs, and they disappeared from Europe around the time of the French Revolution. Nevertheless, the name "galley slave" continued to be used for convict laborers in France, Spain and Italy for another century or more.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">"classic" pirate era</a> lasted about thirty years, from around 1680 to 1710. Blackbeard and Anne Bonney were a little after this, 1718 or so.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Blackbeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a> himself was only a captain two years, and spent a part of those two years trying to go legit as a privateer.
</li><li> Granted, most "pirates" had been privateers in the British or French Navy before that, and the buccaneer communities in Hispaniola date back to at least 1630.
</li><li> The exact span of the Golden Age of Piracy is debatable, with some historians including the post-War of the Spanish Succession period (1715 to the 1720s or '30s). That being said, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland">Treasure Island</a></em> takes place long after the Golden Age ended by any measure.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite the prominence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetHurts">Of Corset Hurts</a> trope in historical fiction set in many past eras, tight-lacing extreme enough to be painful or body-distorting was only fashionable during the latter half of the nineteenth century and the very early twentieth, and even then was by no means universal. Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, the main point of the corset was not to create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleHourglassFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleHourglassFigure">Impossible Hourglass Figure</a>, but simply to lift up the bust and make it look larger, like a modern push-up bra.
</li><li> The "Antebellum" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>: While technically, perhaps, the term <em>antebellum</em> could mean all of U.S. history before 1860, what most people think of as The Old South, with a cotton-based economy and big white-columned plantations everywhere, was mostly from about 1830 until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. 31 years. Less than one person's lifetime. Outside the "tidewater" coastal areas, much of the South was not even settled by whites until after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>. For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta">Atlanta</a> that burned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em> had not existed in any form at all before 1836, had been called that only since 1847, became a city of any importance only a few years before the war started, and <em>wasn't even Georgia's capital</em> until a few years after the war ended (Georgia has had more places serve as capital than most other states; immediately prior to the American Civil War, the capital was in the tiny town of Millidgeville, and Macon briefly served as the capital in between the two).
<ul><li> This was only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> on the Atlantic Coast - particularly Virginia - and the Gulf Coast (and a few waystations along the major rivers), which is probably where the idea of associating it with the entire South came from. Even in the coastal areas, it was perfectly possible for a person to live from the time cotton began to be grown widely (a little after the cotton gin was invented in 1793) all the way to the time of the American Civil War. This is, admittedly, a little misleading; before cotton was king, tobacco was tops.

This isn't surprising since when the party was formed it didn't have much of a unifying platform beyond opposition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a>. Once Jackson retired from office, the party lost its purpose and became nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">a bunch of squabbling factions</a> incapable of governing effectively. Of the four Whig Presidents, none served a full term, and John Tyler, who held the office the longest, was opposed by most Whigs. The leading Whig Senators Henry Clay and Daniel Webster did succeed in passing the Compromise of 1850, but their party split on the issue, and Clay and Webster dying two years later only hastened the party's disintegration.
</li><li> Inversion: the period of massive immigration to the United States is often perceived as having begun in the 1880s or 1890s and having been largely over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. Actually, there was steady migration from north-western Europe throughout which was supplemented by a burgeoning surge from the 1850s to the 1900s and a relative decline thereafter. However, there were still far more immigrants immigrating post-war than ever before, despite the bans on non-European immigration. Immigration has never dropped below the pre-surge level since the surge ended, even though white people no longer made up the majority of immigrants when non-whites were again allowed in post-WWII. The reason the immigrants from the turn of the century are discussed in American History classes is because from about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> (and beyond in some parts of the country), most Americans were either the children or grandchildren of these particular immigrants, and so they were more interested in the ones from Europe than from, say, Mexico.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> on the whole lasted for ten years (1789-1799) where several successive governments attempted to form and centralize authority, sandwiched between an absolute monarchy and an Empire that was even more absolute than anything that came before. The most famous/notorious phase of the revolution, centering on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Reign of Terror</a>, lasted a single year (1793-1794). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a>, despite being one of the most controversial and notorious figures in history, only held direct power for 11 months and even then he had to share it with other members of the Committee of Public Safety.
<ul><li> On that note, the First French Republic lasted for less than 12 years (1792-1804), during which time the form of government changed several times before finally settling down once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> consolidated power.
<ul><li> Napoleon himself ruled France (first as Consul, then as Emperor), for a slightly longer period  1799 until his defeat at Waterloo in 1815. That's sixteen years plus a hundred days. That's about the same amount of time as the Bourbon Restoration that followed (1815-30).
</li><li> Indeed, his nephew Louis-Napoléon (a.k.a. Napoleon III), regarded by most historians and contemporary commentators as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansSubstitute">Poor Man's Substitute</a>, ruled for twenty-two years (four as President of the Second Republic and then eighteen as Emperor), six longer than his uncle and <em>his</em> Empire arguably had a bigger role in shaping contemporary France and Europe  it played a major role in the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">Imperial Germany</a>, the rebuilding and modernization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris">Paris</a>, the arrival of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in France and the birth of an alliance between France and England that shaped the world wars of the 20th Century, but most people still regard him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>.

It's remembered mostly for the infamous "Bloody Week" that ended it, in which as many people were killed by the French government as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Reign of Terror</a> (and <em>that</em> lasted for a year), and for rioting by the Communards burning down famous monuments like the Tuileries Palace and the Hotel de Ville.

Western-themed TV series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em> ran for so long that their depiction of this period borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>, which is ironic considering that the whole reason this era was an exciting fictional setting in the first place was that it was a time of great <em>change</em>.
</li><li> The zenith of European colonial empires in Africa only lasted two or three generations. A hypothetical African who was born between 1870 and 1880 and died in 1960 or later would have remembered their childhood before the Europeans arrived, lived through the entire colonial period, and died in an independent country.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9zytc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9zytc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9zytc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Assuming, of course, that they lived outside of the coastal regions, which were the first areas to be colonized and last areas to be decolonized.</span> This was obvious at the time because it was called the "Scramble For Africa". In 1870, only 10% of Africa was European-controlled.

</li><li> The Indian Mutiny/Uprising or the Sepoy Rebellion lasted for a single year, but is often remembered in India as the birth of Indian nationalism. In the space of that year, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">vestigial empires</a> like the Maratha Confederacy and the Mughal Empire became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>, and the East India Company was removed from India as a result of its incompetence. Indeed, India only <em>officially</em> became part of the British Empire under direct administration from Parliament <em>after</em> 1858, who, with independence in 1947, ruled over the subcontinent for a period shorter than the East India Company (1757-1858) by ten years.

</li><li> The gold standard was the international monetary standard for only about 40 years, from the 1890s through the 1930s, give or take a few years depending on the country  shorter than the fiat system currently in place. Prior to that, most countries operated on the silver (or in the case of the US, bimetallic) standard.
<ul><li> Though the system of Bretton Woods that was instituted in 1944 was essentially a gold standard on paper and was only rescinded by Richard Nixon, essentially killing any even theoretic possibility of the US Dollar having a fixed value in gold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>.

Though that's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">Imperial Germany</a> risked and lost everything on the Ludendorff Offensive <em>because</em> they knew they needed to win before the US Army arrived; while the U.S. was only involved in two major operations (Germany's Spring Offensive and the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive), these were probably the two most important operations of the war.

<ul><li> The actual Soviet Union lasted for only 69 years, since it wasn't founded until 1922 after the end of the Russian Civil War. In other words, less than one-fourth as long as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Romanov dynasty</a> (16131917, 304 years). It was possible for an individual born under the last Tsar to live to see the breakup of the Soviet Union. In fact, many did.
<ul><li> For example, Lazar Kaganovich (the last surviving dignitary of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Russian Revolutionary</a> regime) who died a month before the breakup of the USSR. Also, Sergey Mikhalkov, the author of the lyrics to both the USSR's anthem and the post-Communist anthem of the Russian Federation, was born in 1913 and died in 2009. Incidentally, Gorbachev was the only Soviet leader to be born in the Soviet Union. All his predecessors were born in the Russian Empire.
</li><li> This surprisingly short time period is the source of the joke, "Born in St. Petersburg, studied in Petrograd, Lived in Leningrad, Died in Saint Petersburg."
</li><li> While most of the Soviet Republics were under Moscow's control for those entire 69 years, the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), western Ukraine, western Belarus (both were part of Poland at the time), and Moldova (part of Romania) were (re-)occupied by Russia in 1944 and broke away in 1991.

This meant that he had the shortest period in office of any premier of the USSR and any office holder of the Russian Federation. This also meant that he had a far smaller role in shaping his government than any major communist revolutionary such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a>, Ho Chi Minh, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro">Fidel Castro</a>.

The wave of major bank failures began in Fall 1930 and went on for several years until Congress set up the FDIC. Basically, the Twenties were a time of looming problems covered up by (the illusion of) prosperity, which served to make he collapse seem far more sudden than it really was.
<ul><li> In fact, the American economy was <em>recovering</em> when the Dust Bowl  a product of decades of horrible farming practices come home to roost thanks to a drought  hit Kansas and other Plains states.
</li><li> Anyone with a passing knowledge of Southern United States history comes away with a very different picture than just New York ticker-tape and the Kansas dust bowl. In the South, the Depression started earlier and lasted longer. This was in many ways a long-term consequence of the cotton boom of the previous century and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">traumatic ending</a>.

</li><li> Japan was only an expantionist fascist dictatorship with an utter disregard for human life ruled by a cruel emperor from 1926 to 1945. Before then it was a run-of-the-mill weak democracy with strong military, business, and criminal elements.

Killing POW and civilians for fun would have been unthinkable in the 1895 Sino-Japanese War and frowned upon in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War, but was perfectly acceptable from 1926 onward. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">(Which is really terrifying, if you think about it.)</a>
<ul><li> In fact, Japan was praised for its exquisite treatment of European POWs during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I (the Chinese civilians caught in the middle were a whole different matter).
</li></ul></li><li> For that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> only existed for 77 years (1868-1945), and is not, as sometimes mistakenly believed, a synonym for "all of Japanese history before V-J Day".

It is called that because the emperor was more powerful during this period than now, and its first few years still had enough domestic unrest that it was not able to begin conquering other countries until about 1880. It would not have been unusual for a person to have been born under the Tokugawa Shogunate (or even potentially the isolationist period, which ended fifteen years before the shogunate collapsed) and lived to see the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</li><li> Going hand in hand with the above and also with the below entry about Germany, the concept of a "Japanese" identity as we think of it today is pretty much a Meiji era creation. Prior to the Meiji period, most Japanese thought themselves as members of their clans first before Japanese. While the various clans on what is now called Japan would unite if a foreign enemy such as the Mongols came and proved too strong for a single clan to defeat, just as often would the clans rely on alliances with foreigners to defeat other equally powerful clans. It was precisely this problem why the Tokugawa shogun became very strict on control (especially with weapon laws) and also why the Meiji Restoration did not go bloodless. As a matter of fact, even the current Japanese language is a creation of the Meiji era by the government to ease communications and trade in addition to building a unity of "one nation". Prior to that Japanese language was so full of different regional dialects that they were often immutable and even different classes had different dialects that could make communication difficult. The Tokugawa made it mandatory for Samurai to learn calligraphy partially for this reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> is a nice series of contrasts:
<ul><li> For the great majority of its history, Germany as it exists today was politically divided and it was only in the age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> that it achieved its famous unity and that unity ended with the arrival of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> and partition of East and West Germany. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">The German Empire</a> lasted less than fifty years, from 1871 to 1918  across the reigns of just three Kaisers, one of whom (Frederick III) only reigned for three months. And since the Empire's successor, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarRepublic">Weimar Republic</a>, lasted just <em>fifteen</em> years, a child born in independent Prussia or Bavaria easily could have lived to see the rise of the Nazi Party before the age of 65. Paul von Hindenburg was a junior officer in the army when the German Empire was formed, and a field marshal when the last emperor stepped down. He was elected President mostly on his World War I fame and (reluctantly) appointed Hitler chancellor in 1933 before dying a year later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">The Nazis</a> controlled Germany for twelve years, 1933 to 1945, shorter than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarGermany">Weimar Germany</a> that preceded it and greatly exceeded by the successive governments of West and East Germany, as well as the government of United Germany (1990-now) and yet everyone still feels that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis">All Germans Are Nazis</a>. For perspective, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FascistItaly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FascistItaly">Fascist Italy</a> existed for 21 years (and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> for an additional two years), Japan was ruled by a psychopath for a little under two decades (see above) and even the puppet state of Manchuria existed for two years more than the Nazis (from 1931 to 1945).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BerlinWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BerlinWall">Berlin Wall</a> itself stood for only 28 years  August 13 1961 to November 9 1989, and as of 2018 has been gone longer than it was up. People usually think it was there longer because they conflate the Wall with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IronCurtain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IronCurtain">Iron Curtain</a>.
</li><li> Any artwork from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> that features German soldiers will probably have them wearing the iconic pikelhaube (that helmet with a pointy spike on the top). In fact, the pikelhaube was remodeled in 1915 (and by September, solders were officially directed to remove their spikes in the field) and discontinued entirely in 1916, replaced with the more modern stahlhelm, meaning it lasted less than two years. Ironically, it'd been used pretty regularly for seventy years up to that point; World War I was essentially the wakeup call for how outdated and impractical it was. Despite this, it was such a distinctive design and such an easy shorthand for Germany that propaganda artwork almost always used the pikelhaube. It didn't hurt that officers wore it when they weren't in the field.
</li><li> Postwar Germany has had two chancellors with longer reigns than Hitler - Helmut Kohl (16 years), Konrad Adenauer (14 years), and Angela Merkel, who started in 2005 and won the elections of 2017, meaning she will almost definitely become the third chancellor to outlast him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a> is rightfully seen as the central legacy of Axis. However, about 70-80% of the victims were killed between mid-1941 and mid-1943. This is when half the Soviet POWs died of starvation and exposure in open-air camps while the Germans were deciding what to do with them, and the bulk of the Undesirables who were not useful for war-work were euthanized to save on food (for feeding them enough to prevent rebellion) and manpower (for guarding them) demands. The other half of the Soviet POWs died as overworked and underfed slaves in factories, and the fit-for-work Undesirables who became unfit for work (or simply could not be protected from the SS by their employers and the local authorities) were euthanized in mid-1943 to mid-1945 period.
</li></ul></li><li> Treblinka, the second most notorious and well-known Nazi death camp after Auschwitz, was only operational for around 15 months over 1942-43. During that time, around 800,000 people were killed there.
</li><li> Stuff about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> made in the United States <em>always</em> starts after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and many are set from <em>D-Day</em> onward, unless they're for the fringe market of Eastern Front enthusiasts or fans of Pacific Naval battles. The period from D-Day to V-E day, when most American-made WWII works are set, was only <em>11 months</em>, June 1944 to May 1945. This is probably a subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay">America Saves the Day</a>. It's somewhat justified because the 11-month "Northwest European Campaign" was <em>huge</em>, the second largest land war in history after the Eastern Front. Though, even from an American perspective, this ignores the various battles in the Pacific starting in 1941, the battles over Germany's skies starting in 1942, or the battles in Italy starting in 1943.
<ul><li> Fighting on the Chinese Front (i.e., the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>) began in 1937.
</li><li> The PRC and ROC have made claims of WWII starting, undeclared, as early as <em>1931</em> - when the Imperial Japanese military invaded Manchuria.
</li><li> The "Flying Tigers" fighter squadron (The 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Chinese Air Force) only existed from December 1941 until July 1942 when they were reabsorbed back into the USAAC. This has not stopped various movies and television shows portraying the Flying Tigers as having existed for years, often taking the origin of the Tigers back into the mid 1930s. One such program, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesOfTheGoldMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesOfTheGoldMonkey">Tales of the Gold Monkey</a></em>, portrayed veterans of the Flying Tigers as having left in the late 1930s to find adventure elsewhere.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">The Apartheid Era</a> system of white minority rule that existed in South Africa, Namibia, and Rhodesia (the southern district of which constitutes modern Zimbabwe) can qualify. Although life for local black Africans in these areas was far from pleasant during the colonial era, most of South Africa (settled by Europeans long before the other two) was in local hands (some black, some white) for much of the 19th Century. The whole of South Africa was conquered by Britain by 1902, and given independence as the Union of South Africa in 1910.
<ul><li> Apartheid as a legal framework came into being in South Africa after the Afrikaner-run National Party won the Parliamentary elections in 1948, and it ended with the first multiracial elections in 1994 - just over 45 years. South Africa imposed the system on South-West Africa (modern Namibia, a former German colony) in 1966, and kept it in place until Namibian independence in 1990 - 24 years. The white minority of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) saw what their South African comrades were doing, thought it was a great idea, and adopted it themselves when they declared unilateral independence in 1965, and it remained on the books until the end of minority rule in 1980 - 15 years. Although with that last one was a doozy...
</li></ul></li><li> It's worth noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina">Red China</a> has had a capitalist market economy (1979-present) far longer than it had a mostly centrally planned socialist command economy (1949-1976). Ditto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vietnam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, which had a planned socialist economy for all of 10 years after unification (1976-1986) before the Đổi Mới reforms which progressively transformed it into a market economy (with associated rapid rises in income and standards of living, though not as much as China).
</li><li> The "British Invasion" began around 1964-65 and ended by late 1967, while the "Cool Britannia" fad lasted between 1996-7 and 1999.
</li><li> The whole flowers-and-drugs Swinging Sixties was this in England. It lasted for the summer of 1968 for a very few people before realizing they had lives and careers to get on with.
<ul><li> The authentic San Francisco/Haight-Ashbury <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">hippie scene</a> similarly only lasted around a year and a half (spring 1966 to autumn 1967).
</li><li> The overall psychedelic period lasted much shorter than popular culture often depicts. Depending on what gets casually called "psychedelic" (long hair on men, colorful clothing, etc.), many people born after about 1960 seem to think it lasted well into the '70s or even later. Here's how it breaks down  it experienced its first stirrings in 1965 (at least with respect to the drug culture, since the style of music had been heard intermittently in earlier years), solidified in 1966, penetrated the mainstream in 1967, reached its peak in 1968, was already on its way out in 1969, and by 1970 was all but dead due to (among other things) the Altamont Speedway massacre, the War on Drugs being launched, and the genres that would eventually coalesce into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> already beginning to supplant the "acid" sound.
</li><li> The "hippie revival" of the late 1990s and early 2000s mostly ended after September 11, 2001.
</li><li> Also in the sixties, most people are aware of the rapid development of the "Space Race" but may not realize how the various missions and phases each last for only a few years. The era when the Soviets had a lead in manned flights really only lasted from 1961 to the launch of the first NASA Gemini craft in 1964. There were six Soviet Vostok missions in three years, and only <em>two</em> Voskhod missions. For NASA, Gemini lasted three years and manned Apollo missions lasted just over four years from Apollo 7 in October 1968 to Apollo 17 in December 1972. The "Apollo spares" missions of Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz took place over three years (1973-1975). Can also apply to individual missions and space flyers; Yuri Gagarin's epochal first spaceflight lasted just under two hours. Alan Shepard was aloft for fifteen minutes in the first American suborbital mission. John Glenn's orbital flight lasted five hours. Even Neil Armstrong himself flew on just <em>two</em> spaceflights. By contrast the NASA Space Shuttle flew one hundred and thirty five missions, over thirty years, but these are still mostly overshadowed by the pioneering years.
</li></ul></li><li> The above goes for other iconic decades, too:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The Roaring '20s</a> as we know it actually began around 1923-24, when Harding died and Coolidge took over, radio abandoned its experimental period, organized crime became big, and the "Golden Age of Sports" took off. The years beforehand were marked by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a>, a post-war recession, and Prohibition was not much of an issue.
<ul><li> Most households didn't have a radio in 1930, although most homes <em>with</em> electricity had one.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> - or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">the version thereof everyone remembers</a> - did <em>not</em> last from 1950 to 1959. For starters, calling it "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Eisenhower</a> era" is a misnomer because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> was in the White House during the decade's first 36 months. Thinking of the '50s as a "peaceful" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingExcitingEverHappensHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingExcitingEverHappensHere">"boring"</a> decade also fails to take into account the years 1950-1954 - the height of the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a> - which was just as controversial politically (if not quite socially) as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> a decade later. One should also keep in mind that by 1954 most Americans still did not own television sets, and that by the decade's end most people - even most white people - did <em>not</em> live in the suburbs, and in fact would not for a few decades more.
<ul><li> Also, the 50s began to end after 1957, when the "space race" began, TV became the dominant medium and the post war "boom" ended.
</li></ul></li><li> The version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> (and probably early 90s) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">that everyone remembers</a>, with its "conspicuous consumption" and hedonistic living  and, considering the moral posturing that was never too far away during those years, arguably a good chunk of hypocrisy as well  lasted only from about 1983 (when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s scheme to kick-start the U.S. economy finally paid off after two years of uncertainty) to 1989 (when the Berlin Wall fell and the early 90s depression began). The years prior to that are better understood as a continuation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. And the years afterward, if not quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> yet, as a sort of in-between period during which the '80s ethos was slowly fading.
<ul><li> To boot, the 80s before 1986 were marked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a>, arcade games, and yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a>. Afterwards, home consoles and PC's became commonplace, dance-pop and urban took over the charts, alternative rock began its uprising, the stock market crashed in a heralding of the new depression, and US-USSR relations thawed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Khmer Rouge only controlled Cambodia for about 3 years and 9 months (April 17, 1975 to January 8, 1979), which manages to make the utter destruction and massive death toll they were responsible for even more unthinkably horrific. They were overthrown as a result of a war with the neighboring Socialist Republic of Vietnam, a war which went far to cast doubt on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory">Domino theory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that had informed Western strategy in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> until then.
<ul><li> It could be easy to get this impression given how long some countries insisted Democratic Kampuchea (the Khmer Rouge regime) should keep Cambodia's UN seat. A number of countries took Vietnam's liberation of Cambodia as a slap to the face.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGulfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGulfWar">The Gulf War</a> on the ground only lasted 100 hours, though the entire conflict lasted nearly seven months beginning to end.
</li><li> Dynasties in American sports are dominant for a briefer period than it appears, such as the Dallas Cowboys of the early 1990s, the New York Yankees of the late 1990s, and the New England Patriots of the early 2000s. Also, the period during which they are contemporarily perceived as dynasties is even shorter. One of the longest dynasties in pro football - the Cowboys under coach Tom Landry - lasted from 1960 to 1989, but that arguably doesn't count as a dynasty because the 'Boys were a really good team during only about a third of that span at the most (mid-Seventies through mid-Eighties).
<ul><li> The NBA in the Eighties is often thought of as an epic struggle for dominance between Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers, and Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics, but actually those teams only faced each other in the Finals three times between 1984 and 1987 (with the Lakers winning two). One could just as easily conclude it was a struggle between Magic and the Lakers and Julius "Dr. J" Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers, who also faced each other three times in the Finals, from 1980 to 1983, with the same record (Lakers winning two). During that early part of the decade, the 76ers also had a better regular season record than the Lakers <em>or</em> the Celtics. The Houston Rockets also managed to get past the Lakers to face the Celtics twice (the Celtics winning both times).
</li></ul></li><li> Much like dynasties many sports that become so iconic with a country's identity or as a culture's intrinsic past times actually became popular only recently. Case in point, the Big 3 major sports today often associated with the United States are baseball, basketball, and football and pop-cultural osmosis led many to think those were so traditional they were always America's past time. A little less than a century ago none of the three except for baseball existed, and even then they only became mainstream nearly twenty years after their creation (not necessarily the "big 3". On top of that, for a good 30-year period, the Big 3 were actually boxing, horse racing, and baseball as the dominant sports in mainstream America. Likewise, cricket only became the phenomenon it is today in India after some championships were won post-WWII.
</li><li> Pele is widely considered the greatest football (soccer) player of all time. Yet his performances on what would today be considered the world stage were remarkably few. Until the last couple of years of his career (when he was well past his prime) spent at the New York Cosmos, Pele spent his entire career in Brazil (and Brazilian football at the time was mostly regional, with little national competition), and left little video footage. Outside of Brazil itself, and to a lesser extent South America, most people only know Pele from Intercontinental Cup and World Cup matches - of which Pele played just 3 and 14 respectively.
</li><li> The rivalry between John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg is widely considered one of the greatest in tennis history, but it is often forgotten how short it was. The gap between the first and last times the two faces each other was less than three years, and the four times they met in Grand Slams, all finals, all took place within the space of 14 months in 1980 and 1981. As a comparison, the more recent rivalry between Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal (often compared to Borg-McEnroe) has been going 13 years and counting, and has included 12 Grand Slam matches.
</li><li> The Taliban only <em>really</em> controlled Afghanistan for about five years (1996-2001). The rest of the time they were just the biggest fish in the pond. You can still find old and even middle-aged men there that <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/captured/2013/01/28/podlich-afghanistan-1960s-photos/5846/">remember a time when their women didn't have to be covered from head to toe and not show their faces just to be considered proprietous<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>... and that's ignoring the areas in the northern mountains that the Taliban never conquered.
<ul><li> This is also true of many parts of the Muslim world. As recently as the 1970s and 1980s, the vast majority of the Muslim world was dominated by secularism and varieties of "socialism" and there was little difference between women's fashion there and in the West. Since then, however, there has been something of a resurgence of piety  brought on, many social scientists think, by the increasing prosperity and consequent ascendancy of the region's middle class. Some have even called them "the new Calvinists" after the similarly pious and similarly mercantile Europeans of the 16th-18th centuries.
</li></ul></li><li> Between the start of construction in 1968 and the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the World Trade Center towers lasted a little over thirty years. Furthermore, the towers opened in 1973, so they were only in operation for twenty-eight years.
</li><li> The killing spree of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer">the Zodiac<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, perhaps the most famous serial killer in American history, was much shorter than you'd think given the nearly mythical status pop culture has given it. It's only known for sure that he killed five people over the span of about ten months, between December of 1968 and October of 1969. However, he continued to taunt the police with cryptic letters as late as 1974 and claimed responsibility for 37 murders that stretched back as early as 1966, which helped to push his reputation far beyond what the facts support.
</li><li> Similar to the Zodiac Killer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a> is one of the most famous serial killers of all time, certainly one of the most famous in British history. His "reign of terror" lasted from August 31st to November 9th in the year 1888, a period of just over two months. During this time, he also is thought to have killed only five women, two of which were on the same night (as it's believed that his first kill was interrupted before he went through his usual routine). The reason the murders get such attention is that the killer completely shattered the notion of a safe and pristine Victorian England, though the ideas and values of the time were already on the way out when the Ripper struck; it just provided a rather gruesome exclamation point to mark the end of an era.
</li><li> The 1967 lines (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">which all armistice parties at the time insisted were ''not'' borders</a>) only existed for less than two decades - from the armistice agreements after the Israeli War of Independence to the Six Day War. "1967 lines" is also a misnomer, as 1967 is when those lines became obsolete as any even <em>de facto</em> international borders. Before the formation of Israel, Mandatory Palestine included all the current territory of Israel and the PA, excluding the Golan Heights (which were conquered by Israel in 1967) - and it existed longer than the 1967 lines. However, those lines count also as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact">Short-Lived Big Impact</a> as despite everybody's insistence at the time that the lines did not mean a thing, the vast majority of Israeli society and most people outside Israel agree that <em>some</em> agreement "based on the 1967 lines" should be the solution for the conflict - the big sticking points are of course the details.
</li><li> Although one of the most familiar signifiers of the 19th century, the penny farthing bicycle didn't appear until 1869 and went into rapid decline once the chain-driven "safety bicycle" we know today was introduced in 1885.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a> was basically over after less than a year of fighting- North Korea (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Volunteer_Army#Early_Chinese_involvement">and China in secret<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) invaded South Korea in late June 1950, the North Korean armies collapsed under an American-led offensive by October 1951, the Chinese drove the Americans out of North Korea and conquered Seoul by January 1951 in their first three Phase Offensives, Seoul was retaken by the Americans in April 1951, the Chinese fourth and fifth Phase Offensives were crushed by May 1951, and all land taken by the communists was back in American/South Korean hands by the end of June 1951. Over half of all side's casualties occurred in this condensed year of fighting, as did all of parts of the war where territory actually changed hands. The other two years of the war consisted of relatively moderate border battles (note: still hundreds of thousands of casualties) while terms were negotiated, and the armistice settled on pretty much the June 1951 <em>status quo ante bellum.</em>

<ul><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long-Runners</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">Doorstoppers</a> often take place within the time span of a year to ten at most. Even series where the ending chronologically takes place years after the main conflict has resolved, the primary conflict often takes no more than a year with many fictions having it within the time of months. Some great examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, where readers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime">assume the action takes as long as the story did to be published</a>, but in each case, the entire plot is wrapped up in a year or less. Often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">invoked</a> by the main cast, who cannot believe the hardships they have been through took so little time, despite being hardened and traumatised by their stories, and feeling like decades had passed.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlbedoErmaFelnaEDF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlbedoErmaFelnaEDF">Albedo: Erma Felna EDF</a></em> was published from 1984 to 2005 (almost twenty-one years) (excluding prototype issues, side-stories, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> and the sequel <em>Birthright</em>) with 34 issues published irregularly. That means, if all those issues had been published on a regular, monthly schedule, the whole comic would have lasted just under <em>three years</em> before being canceled, while in-universe, the whole plot takes place in just <em>six</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Spider-Man</em>, Peter's relationship with Gwen Stacy. Given all the prominence Gwen gets because of her death, you'd be inclined to believe they were in a relationship for a very long time, but considering Peter only met her in college (when he was 18) and did not immediately get into a relationship with her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> leaves a window of <em>at most</em> two years for them to actually have had a relationship, probably shorter, as Peter can't have been much older than 20 when she died. It's not exactly <em>short</em>, but it definitely isn't as long as some might be inclined to believe considering how Peter, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, is still hung up on it four decades later.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Clone Wars have been exhaustively documented in two prequel trilogy movies, an additional feature film, two multiple-season cartoon series, several video games and novels, dozens of comic books...the list <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Clone_wars">goes on<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Of course, it <em>does</em> span the better part of a galaxy twice the diameter of our own Milky Way. And we still remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> despite that only lasting a year longer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> itself also qualifies. It only exists for some 20-25 years, depending on what to set as the date of dissolution. In our own world, even the smallest empires have lasted a century or so.
<ul><li> Not only that, but it lasted 19 years trying to keep up a constitutional facade and only four years without any Senate and with the Death Star and Terror as the means to enforce control. This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">remarkably similar to how the Roman Empire</a> kept up the facade for centuries (It's after all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">Just the First Citizen</a>) and "Emperor" never fully became a title inherited solely by blood until Byzantine times.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, the original Jedi Order is officially only "dead" for 19 years (not much longer than two presidential administrations) before Luke discovers his Force powers with Obi-Wan's help. For perspective, the original Order had existed for around <em>25,000</em> years by the time Palpatine executed Order 66.
</li></ul></li><li> Batman's career in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em> lasts less than a year, with a few days tacked on after an eight-year retirement, followed by a hiatus of some months while he is imprisoned by Bane, and ending with one final day in action.
</li><li> Similarly in the sprawling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisFits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisFits">that brought it all together</a>, that proved a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> of movies was possible, the great, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">the mighty</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">The Avengers</a> as a team only lasted 4 years in and out of universe. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> confirms that the date of each movie's release was the year it takes place in, which means that the much hyped team's original tenure was from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> in 2012 to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> in 2015 when Thor, Iron Man and Hulk all left the roster, with an extra year added in for a different roster before being broken up completely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>. It's a testiment to the hype and quality of the movies, that even though the time with the team was so brief when they broke up it still carried weight to it.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> left Cimmeria at the age of 17 and became King of Aquilonia by his forties. Considering that most of the countless stories and comic books about his adventures are set between those dates, he never had a day off.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirBulychev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirBulychev">Kir Bulychev</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture">Alisa Selezneva</a> is a similar example. There are dozens of novels and stories about her, and she is almost never described as below 8 or above 12. It makes for some very eventful four years.
</li><li> The main story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> starts in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">298 AC</a>, and is near the end of 300 AC by the start of <em>The Winds of Winter</em> (book six out of seven). Given how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">long</a> the books are and how absurdly eventful the story is (with multiple continent-spanning wars, entire great houses being extinguished, people completely changing their beings through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, copious amounts of back-stabbing and side-switching, etc.), this is something of a stretch. Especially compared to real historical medieval conflicts, which could last decades.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, Buffy Summers spent only slightly over two years as a Sunnydale High School student, arriving in March 1997 and graduating in July 1999 (based on airdates and internal story logic.) In 'Welcome to the Hellmouth' Buffy is already 16 and turns 17 in 'Surprise' which was set and aired in January 1998 meaning all of Season One and half of Season Two have to take place over <em>less</em> than a year. In fact her actual time in Sunnydale during this period is even <em>less</em> as she canonically spent the Summers of 1997 and 1998 in Los Angeles. This period is already pretty full of events for Buffy, even just including the first three seasons of her show but that hasn't stopped dozens of comics, novels and short stories being inserted into the 'High School Era'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HiDeHi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HiDeHi">Hi-de-Hi!</a></em> ran for nine seasons over eight years, but the time covered in universe is only from the spring of 1959 to the autumn of 1960 - and that's including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> of several months, since it's set in a holiday camp which is closed for half the year.

<ul><li> Due to the decent length of the games themselves (30-40 hours each in real time), all of the interstellar travelling that goes on, how severely characters and their relations change (from total strangers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">One True Love</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life-Partners</a>, from antisocial rogues to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, etc.), and the sheer number of important events that happen including major wars and societal shifts, one would think that the first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> games encompass a long, epic saga, or at least a decade or so. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/53g7ln/how_much_time_passes_inuniverse_in_the_games_find/">In fact,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> per the official timeline, the time frame of the games comes out to a little over three years, the vast majority consisting of time skips where nothing of note happens and the main characters are separated. Shepard was in command of the Normandy for <em>less than nine months.</em>
<ul><li> A specific example: the Reaper War in the third game, the largest conflict in recored galactic history, lasts about three months in-universe according to Shepard's conversation with Tali in the final mission. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">In this time, the entire galaxy is brought to the point of near-total defeat, every fleet is destroyed, thousands of worlds are occupied, and several worlds are burned to cinders.</a>

Booker was born in 1874, Booker's baptism and "transformation" was 1890, and Columbia was launched in 1893 during the Chicago World's Fair. It was stated to be launched then because Comstock had become a very influential religious and political leader in the U.S., and had enough pull to convince Congress to invest in the project. Meaning Comstock/Booker went from PTSD-ridden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">Lower-Class Lout</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> of the flying city and influential enough to convince the world's most powerful economy to build the thing... in three years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">At the age of 19.</a> This also applies to the city itself.

Nope. The game takes place in 1913, and Columbia seceded from the U.S. in 1902. Turns out the vast majority of Columbians weren't actually born there, and Comstock, rather than being an octogenarian, is under forty and merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanHeLooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanHeLooks">Older Than He Looks</a> due to overuse of the Lutece Device.</span>

But, oddly enough, nearly every single game that focuses on it (including five of the six first <em>Halo</em> games; <em>Wars</em> was the one exception), as well as a considerable portion of the novels and comics, are set between the start of the Fall of Reach in August 2552 and the end of the war in December 2552, a period of only four months.
