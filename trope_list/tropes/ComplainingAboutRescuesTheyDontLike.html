</li><li> Averted in the "Arabian nights" episode parodying the Soul Society arc. When "Chigo" goes to save "Rukiruki", she tears up and asks why he didn't save her earlier. Chigo then pokes at her and says that's not what she's supposed to say.

Clare then apologizes, and takes care of the rest of Agatha, this time without harming a single follicle. In this case it's a mutual joke, since Clare had just said the precision of her technique had improved and that she only hit her hair because she wasn't specifically trying not to hit her hair.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Corsair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Corsair">Corsair</a></em>, Canale does this to a degree when Ayace saves him from his former master <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the best example is when Aura complains to Ayace about taking too long to rescue her at the end. Rather than genuine ungratefulness it's simply because they're in the habit of ribbing each other.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, after Vegeta allows Babidi to turn him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Majin</a>, he gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> where he explains that it was all because of his hatred for Goku surpassing him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: Mustang bursts in at the last second and manages to save Hawkeye and Fuery from Gluttony. As he sags in relief over the fact that they're still alive, Hawkeye promptly turns to him and practically rips his face off with the force of her anger. Bitchiness averted by the fact that she's mad not because he saved their lives, but because he came out and exposed himself as part of what was supposed to be a covert operation and now she's worried for him.
</li><li> In Episode 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's</a></em>, Fate saves Signum from a monster on a reflex.

Motoyasu gets in a duel against Naofumi to "free" Raphtalia from him and wins it through <em>cheating</em> (outside interference from Malty, who attacked Naofumi from behind when he was getting the upper hand). While it's true that Naofumi purchased Raphtalia as a slave and has her fight for him, Motoyasu fails to see that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">she is perfectly content like that</a>, and she's understandably angry that he and everyone else strongarmed her to remove her slave mark without question.

And she still doesn't when she clocks Ayeka — she simply strikes so hard that the cocoon doesn't make a difference.

<ul><li> To remind us that there is still prejudice against mutants, most 90s-onward comics with X's somewhere in their titles loved to make use of this trope to such an extent that it became a major theme of more than one comic. Almost never is any character seen thanking a mutant for their rescue, despite the alarming frequency with which those rescues occur. This is made even worse by the fact that most of the dangers that X-mutants save people from are caused by other humans, who the near-victims apparently don't hate quite so much as their rescuers. Say what?

</li><li> Also subverted in X-Men in the character of Senator Robert Kelly. He started off as an outspoken anti-mutant activist with honest concerns about the effect of mutants in society, but over the course of many rescues by various mutants his stance began to soften, saving the X-Men's bacon on at least one occasion (during <em>Zero Tolerance</em>) by seeking legal action against a government-sponsored Sentinel program.
</li><li> One extreme example had Chamber saving the life of <em>another mutant</em> and being called a "monster". Admittedly, said mutant was a child and was nearly murdered in cold blood by two particularly irrational mutant haters (they blamed the failure of their dot-com company on mutants), but still...

Nightwing calls him out on not being appreciative of it, only for Robin to exclaim that he could have made the jump. Nightwing ends the argument claiming that he was only trying to play it safe because he didn't want to have to explain to Bruce how he could lose yet another partner. Naturally, this ends up turning into an argument as to why Nightwing was there in the first place with Robin accusing Batman of having sent someone to keep an eye on him while he was gone. Nightwing responds that it was his idea and not Batman's and that Robin could use the help given that Gotham is hard to handle on a normal day without the added bonus of a natural disaster having just occurred.

Their reaction to his flippant comments was in part thanks to being frayed from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a rough interrogation and the looming threat of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReforgedIntoAMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReforgedIntoAMinion">forcibly turned to the Shadow</a> by one of the Forsaken</span>; all the same, they don't give him so much as a grudging apology until Aviendha takes them to task in a later book. Also worth noting is that while Nynaeve and Elayne's forced apologies are completely insincere at the time (they don't acknowledge that Avienda is correct, they just don't want her upset with them) they later both wholeheartedly acknowledge his worth either to himself (Elayne) or to someone else speaking ill of him (Nynaeve) whereas Egwene who was not present when Avienda confronted the other two never ends up addressing her own character flaws and keeps them throughout.

He is even <em>put to death</em> by someone he just saved because the disaster is blamed on him. At one point he rescues Shirou from Caster's temple; half of the rescue involves both of them telling the other to shut up and the other half is them calling each other idiots.

</li><li> Princess Verbina - when Jack gets her and her brother into a getaway car, she tells him to navigate while she drives. Justified, since Jack just demonstrated that he has no idea how to drive and nearly got them all killed.

When Static manages to return the car to the ground safely, the frightened driver does berate him for a moment, but then asks him to do the same thing to get him to where he was intending to go, claiming the city's traffic to be 'even scarier'.

<ul><li> A Think Progress reporter apparently got mugged, only to have a gun-carrying woman save them. <a class="urllink" href="https://freebeacon.com/blog/think-progress-writer-was-quite-upset-a-concealed-carrying-woman-killed-her-armed-mugger/">This apparently didn't go over well<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This is why Good Samaritan laws exist. Not only do some people complain about being rescued, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">sue their rescuer in court</a>. While it is true that amateurs may not always succeed at emergency first aid, it is also true that in some cases Emergency Services simply cannot reach the victim in time. This does not even take into account cases where even successful treatment can lead to injury such as broken rib bones after administering CPR (which is almost guaranteed to break at least one rib when done properly) or the Heimlich maneuver.
</li><li> The best way to open a person's airway to deliver rescue breathing involves moving the head. In a situation where the patient may have spine trauma, however, moving the head carries a risk of paralysis. For this reason, rescuers are trained to try to open the airway by manipulating the jaw bone—unless that doesn't work, in which case "life over limb" kicks in. There is a distant possibility that the patient (or his bereaved family) could try to sue because one or the other method injured someone, or didn't work.
</li><li> This can crop up in a military mileu due to "life or limb" decisions. When a major artery in a limb is severed (or worse perforated) the loss of blood can rapidly exsanguinate a soldier. The most common treatment is a tourniquet, which was long thought to guarantee the loss of a limb. There are those who would rather die than live as a cripple and sometimes it's the medic who has to make the call without any knowledge of the soldier's wishes. Fortunately, in the last 10 years research has shown that limbs can survive tourniquet treatment for up to 45 minutes, so these situations are becoming less common.
</li><li> Naloxone/Narcan is a powerful opiate receptor antagonist that is used to reverse the effects of opiate overdose, or, in plain English, instant buzzkill in a syringe. When EMTs administer it to people who have overdosed on heroin and the like, it's not uncommon to have to deal with one very pissed-off junkie, which is why most professionals restrain a person <em>before</em> administration or raise their oxygen levels a bit beforehand so the shock isn't quite as severe when they come out of it. It's something of a newbie rite of passage to get clocked by someone coming out of it kicking and screaming since if done properly it can take effect <em>way</em> faster than you think.
</li><li> EMTs are trained to expect situations where patients have signed DNRs, but the family is insisting that he/she had changed her mind. Most teachers advise that when in doubt, one should treat, because no one has ever won a lawsuit for being wrongfully kept alive (but people have tried).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/ex-fema-director-michael-brown-criticizes-obama-reacting-202803013.html">Heck of a rescue, Mr. President.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> For extra irony, the one who was complaining about it was himself criticized for his slowness in responding, while his critique is that the response was too <em>fast</em>.
</li><li> Something like this seems to have happened insurance company AIG, who attempted to <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/aig-thinking-suing-government-bailing-041150357--finance.html">sue the Government for bailing it out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> only to later <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/aig-says-not-join-lawsuit-against-u-government-201052589--finance.html">withdraw the complaint amid public backlash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In this case it's not the fact that they were bailed out so much as some of the specifics. This incident in particular was mocked by The New York Daily News, which ran an editorial cartoon in which a lifeguard saves a drowning man with "AIG" on his belly. When the lifeguard asks the man how he feels, the victim says, "like suing you."
</li><li> Julius Caesar, while being held hostage by pirates, was insulted by the fact that their ransom demands were so low. He claimed he was worth more to Rome than their demands and thus demanded they ransom him for a higher price. Not an uncommon move for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a>. He also promised them that he would hunt them down and kill them. They thought he was kidding. He wasn't.
