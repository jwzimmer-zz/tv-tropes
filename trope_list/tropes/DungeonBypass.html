She then notices Nanoha pointing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">her staff</a> at the floor and powering up for a <em>Blaster 3</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Divine Buster</a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBArXz3cWos">promptly realizes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that she is <em>screwed</em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">manga</a> version of the villainess had filled a five-story building with mages and warriors capable of matching Lina. Instead of going through them, Lina just flies straight to the top of the tower where the villainess was.
</li><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV">OAVs</a> does this too, with an underground dungeon a demon generates. Lina just blasts downward through all the floors, and comments that it's kinda stupid that the monster is <em>always</em> at the bottom floor of these things.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Hunter Exam arc. Gon and his companions (plus Tonpa "The Rookie Killer", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> who was acting like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> on purpose) are near the exit of a tower full of traps when they come across a branch. The "easy path" goes straight to the exit, but the door to the easy path will only open if they leave two members of their group behind and chained to the wall. The "hard path" will allow all of them to exit, but will take too long for them to make the deadline for escaping the tower. However, the two exits are next to each other, so after some thought and a lot of effort, they manage to break through the wall separating the easy path and the hard path.
</li><li> Gon also did this in a later story arc. He and his friend had been manipulated into a mansion by a tough enemy talented in anticipating their movements (and who knew where the doors were). The heroic duo started kicking through the walls...
</li><li> One expert rock climber in the Hunter Exam tried to circumvent the tower entirely by simply climbing down. Unfortunately for him the skies around the tower were patrolled by man-eating giant birds.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Ed transmutes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">Death Course</a> into a perfectly inoffensive hallway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> Kayneth el-Melloi turns the upper floors of the hotel he's renting into a fortress filled with magic traps and summoned monsters. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">highly pragmatic</a> Emiya Kiritsugu simply levels the entire building with explosives.
</li><li> Both subverted and played straight with the Maze Card in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>; trying to fly over the walls causes them to grow (or turns the maze into an Escher masterpiece), but the Moon Bell knocks down the walls in a straight line.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Occurs during the Enies Lobby arc. The crew has to reach the top of a courthouse tower and Zoro, whose sense of direction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection">rivals Ryoga Hibiki</a>, is having a tough time finding his way. Eventually he realizes he merely needs to go up, and launches his <em>Tatsumaki</em> attack (straight upwards windcutting tornado) and clears a path upwards for himself, inadvertently sending Chopper and Nami up as well. Afterwards, Sanji presumably has the same idea and crashes through the room just after Zoro climbs out. At the same time, Usopp—I mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Sogeking</a>—gets himself thrown to the roof from outside by a giant he had recently convinced to switch sides.
</li><li> Earlier, in the Alabasta arc, Sanji invokes this trope by realizing the easiest way to get to the clock tower in this maze of a city is to kick through the walls of every building in his way. This later comes back to bite him in the ass when he overhears townsfolk complaining about the repair work they'll have to do.
</li><li> Much later in the series, several members of the Straw Hat Pirates find themselves in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWoods">spooky forest</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">animate trees</a> that rearrange themselves to keep Luffy and the others lost inside. Luffy's solution is to simply destroy every tree that gets in his way—before long, the trees realize there are too few of themselves to trap the main characters in any non-obvious way. Not long after <em>that</em>, they just let the Straw Hat Pirates travel through however they want, as the <em>trees</em> are now the ones terrified of the pirates.
</li></ul></li><li> In a short story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, the SOS Brigade are stuck acting out a typical Medieval RPG in simulated space. Not only do they bypass a lot of dungeons and battles (by threatening an NPC, no less), but the biggest use of this trope is found when they reach the final dungeon, still at level one and probably lacking all the key items and skills they need to beat the last boss. The solution? Mikuru accidentally casts two doomsday level spells at once, completely demolishing the entire castle and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> with it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">And the hostages they were supposed to rescue.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCatReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCatReturns">The Cat Returns</a></em>:
<ul><li> The King's henchmen put up fake walls in a maze to make sure the heroes can't find their way to the end. However, the Baron realizes a wall is fake, and the kicks it down—which, since the henchmen had unknowingly set themselves up like dominoes, causes a chain reaction of falling walls until they form a pathway straight to the exit.
</li><li> Muta tries this earlier by climbing up the walls of the maze, but it turns out the guards expected that.

Yugi and Joey attempted this themselves by summoning Black Skull Dragon so it could fly over the maze's walls, only for the brothers to say flying is not allowed.

Faced with a situation where German occupation forces occupy most of Europe and it will require a massive effort over a period of years (with horrifying American and Russian Army casualties) to drive them back, the U.S. elects to destroy Germany directly by means of a nuclear attack aimed at its war production industry.

Fly gets fed up with hunting for key cards and fighting monsters over them so he blasts a door open with a few rockets. This is the only locked door he ever destroys: he meets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">barons of hell</a> shortly afterward and they can withstand four to six rockets apiece. From that point on rockets are reserved for emergencies and "boss fights" so he and Arlene run the dungeons looking for key cards. One time he suggests the option to Arlene to avoid entering a maze of unnatural darkness to find the key. Their rocket supply is dangerously low so they brave the dark maze instead of risking taking the next baron without ammo. They encounter a baron in the maze and they kill it for the key. Running the dungeon cost them all their rockets when the Dungeon Bypass would have used a few.

Ahriman circumvents these defenses by using a ritual to teleport his entire force right into the heart of the City from a planet halfway across the galaxy, with their cataclysmic arrival throwing the defenders into disarray for good measure.

To do this, the gnomes would follow the villagers around. If a fisherman didn't get rid of the gnomes before going out in his boat, it would mean terrible bad luck. So how did they get rid of the gnomes? Easy: Dungeon Bypass! Every fishing village would have a labyrinth (mostly a simple spiral) built from rocks as big as a head or so. Before going out, the fisherman would walk all the way to the middle of the spiral, the gnomes presumably trailing him. When he reached the middle, he would simply run across the stones, down to his boat, and cast off. The gnomes, too small to jump over the stones, would have to take the long way out of the spiral, and would be too late to sneak on the boat.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> A notorious tactic is the "scry and die", in which the player characters use divination spells to locate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, then cast a teleport spell to ambush him wherever he happens to be, bypassing any and all elaborately prepared defenses he has set up. The "Mind Blank" spell is a hard counter to this — only deity-level power can scry someone under its effects. Unfortunately, as an 8th-level spell, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> needs to be almost that powerful themself to keep it running. For game balance reasons, editions up to 3.5 largely had to make the choice between "scry and die is possible" and "ambushing the <em>players</em> isn't". Later editions decided to just sacrifice a little balance and realism to focus on making the adventure fun to play.
</li><li> The 3.5 splatbook "Complete Arcane" adds Anticipate Teleportation, a spell specifically to counter this strategy. Its duration is 24 hours, just like Mind Blank, but it's only 3rd level, because instead of giving the complete mental protection Mind Blank offers, it just warns you of an incoming teleport and holds the would-be ambusher for a round. The Greater version at 6th level gives <em>three</em> rounds instead; enough preparation to ensure that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> experienced by the would-be ambusher is the opposite of the one they expected.
</li><li> In 3.5, 5th level Druids can summon Thoqquas, which can tunnel through solid stone and explicitly leave a usable tunnel. This is especially notable because at 5th level, you normally can't teleport yet, so the DM may not expect shenanigans like this.
</li><li> Many RPGs have so many ways of doing this that it may be futile to try to list them all. There appear to be two main reasons for this: first, many games include countless different spells whose implications are often poorly thought out (though some of this is intentional: there's actually a <em>D&amp;D</em> spell called "passwall", which creates a temporary hole in a wall of your choice). The second reason is many games try to write rules for every conceivable situation, including tunneling through a wall with a battle axe.
</li><li> In fact, in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Edition 3.5, all materials stronger than paper are allotted a hardness score, which dramatically reduces damage dealt to them. Weapons made out of Adamantine, however, ignore the hardness of objects unless they're built from materials equal in strength or stronger than Adamantine. This makes tunneling through a stone wall with an Adamantine Greatsword almost pathetically easy. There are also combat maneuvers which ignore hardness, in case you don't have an adamantine weapon.
</li><li> However, in fourth edition D&amp;D, items and walls no longer had a hardness rating, which means that a weak but determined character could <em>punch through them</em>.
</li><li> Fifth Edition simply treats items like characters in terms of armor class and hit points.
</li><li> It is quite easy for PCs to end up rewarded for this: most strong doors are made up of an expensive material, so simply using "disable device" or other methods to take it off its hinges winds up quite profitable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TombOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TombOfHorrors">Tomb of Horrors</a></em>:
<ul><li> The remake tries to avoid letting players do this. It has replaced all of its Adamantine Doors with "Spell-Hardened Steel as Hard as Adamant, but loses its magic if you dismantled them." It also creates infinite hordes of demons that do nothing but repair the walls and reset traps all day and attack anyone who attempts a Dungeon Bypass.
</li><li> At least one group of adventurers has made it through without a single casualty by having a team of dwarves dig around the traps and obstacles with non-magical mining equipment over the course of several weeks. The writers planned for ethereal travel, melding into stone, magical defenses, teleportation, etc. but never expected an ordinary pickaxe and a group of patient, careful adventurers.
</li><li> Another amusing way groups bypassed the dungeon in the original was to completely skip the dungeon and merely steal the doors, 1000 cu. ft. of solid adamantine and mithral, probably worth more than all the treasure in the tomb itself. Also fixed in the 3.5 remake by having the doors merely by magically hardened steel that loses its magic once removed.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dungeoncrasher Fighter variant in <em>3.5</em> is actually designed to do this, as the name suggests. On top of its much-loved "super Bull Rush" that slams opponents into walls until their bones liquefy, it also gets, by 6th level, a +10 bonus to checks to break objects and a +4 to dodge or resist traps. Many Dungeoncrashers get through dungeons by simply breaking everything in them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> doubles down on this with cooperative spellcasting, where the players sit in a circle and add effects to a spell until it fails or becomes too difficult to add further aspects or power. This means that a single character with access to the correspondence sphere (which allows scrying) means that the party can drop the majority of its offensive power on an enemy without showing up themselves to potentially be exposed to danger. Especially dangerous since in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a> the various types of supernatural creatures had no way to resist each others' powers, effectively making this the point where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> thing became completely insurmountable in any kind of mixed campaign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> made major changes to no less than four fundamental mechanics solely to prevent this tactic: draconian limits on spell combination, severely reduced power when adding sympathetic magic, cripplingly specific prerequisites for scrying (to the point where you can barely scry anything you don't have regular physical access to anyhow), and scry targets have what is usually a near-unity chance of noticing the spell from their end. Joint casting was also removed entirely and replaced with an assist-boost mechanic. That's how unambiguously game-breaking and impossible to stop from the GM's end the tactic was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> has several game mechanics that allow you to put your forces behind your opponent's lines, such as infiltrating, outflanking, and deep striking. The <em>Apocalypse</em> and <em>Planetstrike</em> supplements also provide special strategic assets and stratagems that can also help your forces bypass defensive lines. Also, if you happen to have fast skimmer transports, you can literally just <em>fly</em> over enemy lines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>: Solars with the correct Charm can bypass locked doors by <em>walking through them</em>, and more veteran ones can remove the walls by punching people through them. Meanwhile, those with dematerialization effects can just stroll through walls, and experienced Infernals can just load up Pellegrina's Fury and <em>erode away everything in their path</em>. Of course, the point of <em>Exalted</em> isn't about whether the heroes <em>can</em> make it through the dungeon, it's about whether they <em>should</em>, and how they intend to solve the long-term problems that led to the dungeon attack in the first place.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> adventure Fortress o' Fear, the players are sent to locate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a portal to the Hunting Grounds</span> within Devil's Tower. If they enter near the base of Devil's Tower, it's a long and arduous journey through labyrinthine rooms and dangerous monsters. However, they have the option of hiring an Ornithopter pilot in City o' Gloom who will offer to fly them right on top of the tower, which is <em>much</em> closer to their destination and a lot less hazardous. Oddly enough, the adventure seems to push the players in this direction, essentially encouraging them to bypass the detailed dungeon they'd created.
</li><li> An unintentional but still viable strategy when it comes to dealing with ambushes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>. Pretty sure that the only road through the city is mined and that there's a <em>Hunchback</em>, a Demolisher, and two Hetzers hiding in the side alleys just waiting for you to pass by? Don't even bother with streets—blast your way through the buildings instead. A lance of Battlemechs can carve through buildings, even reinforced ones, at an impressive rate. An <em>Awesome</em> can level a strip mall in as little as 10 seconds—that is to say, <em>one turn</em>.

Most times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">the franchise</a>, there is a boss guarding that tile, but in the NES version, several bosses don't start the map on it, instead moving onto it during their first turn. The player moves before the enemy, so if you can get Marth to the tile in one turn, you can end the map incredibly early. The developers obviously assumed you wouldn't get to them in one turn, forgetting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">Warp Staff</a> that you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">get in Chapter 3</a>, allowing you to cut short <em>many</em> long maps.

The most important example is in level 3, where you descend upon a big, deep catacomb full of undeads in order to steal some artifacts and then you have to backtrack all that Hell to the surface (unless you play on the easiest difficulty or you find a secret tunnel near the end). The most gamey example is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> in level 6, where you are supposed to go inside a haunted cathedral, steal a magic item, try to escape, find that the doors have been magically sealed and then investigate all the structure and its crypts in order to find how to escape: but you can block the doors with a skull or a rock in the beginning, preventing their closure, which was NOT supposed to be how to play the level (this was fixed in Thief Gold where they close anyway).

<ul><li> Several games have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">shortcuts that lets you cut through large sections of the dungeon</a>.

Then, world 4-2 has another warp zone (better hidden, but still accessible) to let you skip to the last world, cutting out roughly 80% of the whole game.
</li><li> In some levels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a></em>, such as 8-2, these are required to exit the level. Worse, some warp zones send you backwards.
</li><li> Playing as Luigi or Toadstool in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> allows you to easily bypass large chunks of several stages. The princess can skip straight to the end of 4-3 by floating over the gap separating the two towers at the beginning of the stage.
</li><li> <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>
<ul><li> The Lakitu's Cloud item lets you skip entire levels.
</li><li> Then there are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">Warp Whistles</a>, which let you skip entire worlds. There's two in World 1, and using them together can take you directly to World 8, bypassing almost the entire game.
</li><li> Then there's the P-Wing, which can make almost any level a breeze (and unlike the cloud, they stay beaten if you die).

</li><li> There are also the Dungeon Bypass opportunities <strong>within</strong> levels.

In what is apparently <em>lava</em>, no less.<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-QVjqeeoMw">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In other levels in the game, there's a massive wall between the start and finish line, with the majority of the level in a cave underneath it. Which means anyone with the P Wing can just fly straight up, right over the wall and down to the finish block.
</li></ul></li><li> Same with the Feather, Flying Yoshi, or Lakitu's Cloud (again) in <em>Super Mario World</em>, on levels with no ceiling.
</li><li> Once you gain access to the Star Road in <em>SMW</em>, you can skip the rest of the game straight to Bowser's Castle by keyhole-clearing each of its levels. Especially glaring if you get there through the Donut Secret House.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> has <em>The Goopy Inferno</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">No Fludd Run</a> of a level covered in lava that requires you to climb around the village underside to reach the goal. However if you're careful and patient you can just walk along a fence to the giant tree and take a mad dive from the top <em>straight to the end goal</em>, all in all completing the level in about a minute.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, halfway through Rightside Down Galaxy, you can backflip above the maze and walk around the top. Exploring the area nets you 4 1-Ups and the ability to re-enter right on top of the Star. There's also the first Bowser Jr level, the Fiery Flotilla, where you can skip most of the level by jumping on the castle walls and just long jumping to Gobblegut's boss arena.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand">Super Mario 3D Land</a></em>, if it's not an exaggeration or parody, has W7-1. It's normally a water level, where you start on solid ground, go through an underwater area, then use a pipe to reach the flagpole, which is also on solid ground. As a matter of fact, you can even see the flagpole from the start of the level... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhIcgdVJHM0">and, if you have a Tanooki suit, jump over to it, allowing you to skip the entire level and beat it in 5 seconds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

In pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">every single level</a>.

</li><li> You can do this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona">Elona</a></em>, and it's often a way to find hidden passages.

<ul><li> Any game (with the exception of SA 2) in which Tails or Cream (who both have the ability to fly) is playable; also Knuckles to a lesser extent (he can't fly but he can glide and climb walls).
</li><li> <em>Sonic 3</em> (and some of the Sonic Advance series) took this into account though, providing alternate routes only reachable by using those abilities.
</li><li> In <em>Sonic 2</em>'s Oil Ocean Zone, Sonic neither sinks nor dies in the ocean of oil at the bottom of the level as long as he jumps out in time. One can run under the entire level until they hit a wall, jump on top, continue the level like normal, then drop back into the ocean and repeat.
</li><li> Sonic himself can do this in open levels and a spindash, jumping over half a level with ease. Especially if he is Super Sonic (or, in the 3D games, Metal Sonic in the multiplayer of Adventure 2: Battle)

Specifically, a couple levels in particular with the description of "Complete X Laps!" can be sequence broke by turning around at specific points, tricking the game into thinking you've reached a certain lap early.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix">Knuckles Chaotix</a></em> you can play as Charmy, who can fly for as long as you want without ever needing to land, so you can basically go straight through the levels without doing anything.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>, a game which very much prides itself on its flexibility, you can begin the game with a pickaxe or acquire one very early on. A pickaxe can break down every wall, including the ones that separate one level from another. By diligent digging, you can literally bypass the entire dungeon, stopping only to bushwhack a few mandatory bosses before ascending to ultimate victory. This means playing with a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun">underlevelled character</a>, but is quite exciting. The technique is known as <a class="urllink" href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Digging_for_victory">digging for victory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TOME" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TOME">TOME</a></em>, another roguelike, you can get a spell that can remove walls in all unblocked directions at once (with any class) as a result of a lost sword quest. Or make walls in all unblocked directions for when you want to wall in every annoying critter (breeders and stuff that summons greater dragons recursively come to mind) that saw you as a result of the first spell, and then pickaxe yourself a path around them. It's quite random to get either spell, but you usually get a few super powerful spells along the way.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">Roguelikes</a> share this property; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery">ADOM</a></em> also allowed you to modify the map on most levels. In fact, digging was the <em>only</em> way to reach the Elemental Temples.
</li><li> The old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokRoguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokRoguelike">Ragnarok (Roguelike)</a></em> had potions of phasing, which allowed you to walk through walls (except in the shop level) and even between planes, letting you skip the tedious process of looking for portals. If you walked off the map, however, you'd fall to Niflheim and take a lot of damage, usually dying.
</li><li> The RTS game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper 2</a></em> has a campaign level that has racing against the clock while your mission is to destroy the enemy Dungeon Heart, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macguffin">Macguffin</a> is stored in the far North, having to go through another enemy camp in the middle to get there and having overwhelming numbers against you with few resources while you're stuck in the far South. The obvious solution hinted by the mission briefing is to find the bypass. This can be done by building a bridge on the west side over the water and then tunneling past both bases straight to the enemy's Dungeon Heart. Another level gives you the choice of a frontal assault to be able to assassinate the enemy leader or to tunnel east and attack him in his own headquarters bypassing all his defenses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> A justified aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>. On Illium, at the start of the mission to find the Assassin (whose target is in the penthouse of a skyscraper), Shepard notes "Why don't we just fly up to the top?" His/Her informant, however, comments "They have a lot of mercs carrying rocket launchers, just waiting for you to try."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a>: Citadel</em> DLC, Shepard's team has to break into the Citadel archives to stop an identity thief. Brooks mentions that it will be tricky finding a way inside. Vega's response is to hold up a bomb and say, "Not really."
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series, units with flight like the Mothman and Masked Hero can move through enemy units, and disregard the height of terrain, making them extremely useful for any map where you need to get a certain point to complete it, as both of those things will frequently pose problems for normal units.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> one can bypass much of the Shinra Building and its guards by simply taking the stairs as opposed to fighting your way floor by floor. This is, however, incredibly boring, time consuming, <em>and</em> you have to put up with your characters complaining the entire way. There are a few bits of nice loot on the stairs, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> had several "secret" areas in different zones which could only be accessed by passing through long elaborate and often dangerous dungeons, some of which having doors that required multiple players to open and at least one who's entrance was in a completely different area 3 zones away. These areas generally held valuable timed spawn Notorious Monsters or quest objectives. It wasn't until the "Battle packs" added between the 4th and 5th expansions that (most of) these areas finally became easily accessible through Abyssea and/or Voidwatch warps.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, Dungeon Bypassing was the norm to pull off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun">Speed Runs</a> in the endgame. A few seconds after being engaged bosses erected magic barriers sealing players into (or out of) their battle area. These barriers also broke aggro for any mobs caught on the other side when they went up. Players would sprint from one boss to the next, tank leading the way to aggro everything, then stand right at the barrier edge as the boss was pulled, trapping the trash mobs outside and allowing it to be completely bypassed. Square largely killed off this behavior by adding mid-level barriers that require killing all the trash up to that point to open, either explicitly by just not opening while the mobs live, or practically by requiring several uninterrupted seconds of interaction with key items.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChroniclesRingOfFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChroniclesRingOfFates">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</a></em> requires a lot of jump-climbing and in many cases the player has to meet an objective or solve a puzzle to unlock the next platform or lever or switch to allow them to climb to the next level... or, you could just dump the magicites from your inventory and strategically stack them to make a ladder. This becomes especially doable once you have Gnash (who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">Double Jump</a>) and Meeth (whose urn is a constantly-available stepstool).

</li><li> Several dungeons, such as the National Archives, the Antagonizer's Lair, and Olney Powerworks, have a hidden back door that you can use to skip all the monsters and traps and go straight to the boss/Macguffin item/mission objective.
</li><li> In the National Guard Depot, you can squeeze your way through a debris pile blocking a stairway to the third floor, then jump down to the Armory switch on the second floor, bypassing the Training Wing and Offices.
</li><li> The Metro service tunnel leading to the Family's hideout also has a hidden back entrance from Northwest Seneca Station, which is the way most players first discover during the Blood Ties quest. The main tunnel entrance is from the Meresti Trainyard, which is a fair distance away.
</li><li> You can either take the hard route to Vault 87 through Murder Pass, or if you rescued Penny from Paradise Falls, ask Joseph to turn on the computer terminal for you to hack and open the back door.
</li><li> During the Reilly's Ranger's quest, the main marker path leads you eastbound from Metro Central to Freedom Street and the Mutant-infested and irradiated Vernon Square, which is the main entrance to Our Lady of Hope Hospital, but Reilly recommends an alternate route to the hospital from Dupont Circle through the Dry Sewers.

</li><li> A few Raider hideouts such as those in the Federal Ration Stockpile and Andrew Station have a hidden trapdoor leading straight to the ringleader's headquarters, sometimes requiring high lockpick or hacking skill.
</li><li> Played literally in the sidequest "The Big Dig", where you use a mining robot to tunnel into Hancock's warehouse from below, the story quest "Mass Fusion", where you teleport (Institute) or ride a Vertibird (Brotherhood of Steel) to the Mass Fusion Building roof, which is the only way to reach the Executive Suites until you have the keycard, and the finale "Nuclear Option", where you blast your way underground into the Institute, which could previously only be teleported to.

<ul><li> There is a vault that contains a maze to reach the bottom for a mission. Or you can just repair the elevator at the entrance and go straight to the bottom floor.
</li><li> Repair, Science, Speech, Barter, Lockpick and Disguises allow you to do this a lot over the course of the game. The difficulty of Dead Money is largely dependent on if you actually leveled your skills fully or used every possible drug, magazine, and equipment bonus to pass skill checks and put the bare minimum skill points in as a result.
</li><li> Vault 19 has a hidden back entrance via the Sulfur Caves northwest of Whittaker Farmstead.
</li><li> In the DLC <em>Old World Blues</em>, a mission requires you to test out a stealth suit by reaching a safe without being detected. You could carefully avoid and disable robots, turrets, lasers, and land mines. Or you could destroy all the obstacles before the test even begins. Even better, a player with a force-field disabling weapon can use the observation level to drop directly into the final room of the test.
</li><li> When ascending Black Mountain, you normally have to go up a Super Mutant-infested and irradiated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFillingPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFillingPath">switchback path</a>, but if you have a Lockpick skill of at least 75, you can pick the back gate and go straight to Tabitha's hideout.

<ul><li> Many sections of the game could be skipped via alternate routes or player ingenuity (and which the designers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">praise the player for</a>):
</li><li> A smart player could run straight through the first mission (Liberty Island) to the boss and complete it in less than 5 minutes with minimal enemy contact. Once that happens, the UNATCO troops come up behind JC and kill all of the NSF troops. A player that knows what he's doing can force open the UNATCO door with a gas grenade, bypassing the mission entirely. The game acknowledges this.
</li><li> There are several examples of bypassing danger by taking a stealthy route to the target, particularly in Castle Clinton, where the player can use the keypad near the vending machine, go through the vents, and then find the Ambrosia while only encountering one or two guards. Likewise, you can sneak through the maintenance tunnels in the Battery Park subway station past the terrorists (and rescuing the hostages if you so choose), bypassing the situation and the objective (and getting chewed out by your brother when you arrive in Hell's Kitchen).
</li><li> After JC sends the signal from the roof of the UNATCO occupied NSF base, it causes every single soldier inside to turn hostile. You can either fight your way down... or put a bunch of mods in Leg Strength (which lowers fall damage) and jump off the roof. Alternately, you can also carefully knock out the UNATCO soldiers before sending the signal, leaving no one left to fight you as you leave (the game even anticipates this method and gives the player a special message from the guy who sent the kill order.)
</li><li> Several parts of the game can be skipped if the player knows the passwords to certain locked doors: The MJ12 base underneath UNATCO can be skipped entirely if the player knows the code to the exit door. The game doesn't account for this.
</li><li> In Hong Kong, the entire section where JC goes to confront Maggie Chow can be skipped if the player sneaks into Chow's apartment via grenade-jumping and steals the Dragon's Tooth Sword early on. Also, the sidequest about Max Chen needing proof of Maggie's guilt can be skipped if the player already knows the code to the police station vault.
</li><li> Also, the player can skip most of Versalife if they know the codes to certain doors, which allows them to access the Level 3 labs and destroy the Universal Constructor before they're asked to.
</li><li> Lacing the East Side Cemetery with LAM's before you visit Stanton Dowd results in all the MJ12 troops that spawn in getting blown to smithereens instantly. This can also be done in the 'Ton Hotel during the escape with Paul to trivialize an otherwise-hard battle.
</li><li> The majority of the penultimate Silo level can be avoided completely if you run to the hatch leading from the surface down to the Silo, and fire a LAW rocket into it at a certain angle (which glitches through the grate and continues straight downward, killing Howard Strong). This can cause the level to be finished in under a minute.

<ul><li> A variation appears upon teleporting to a city under siege. You're told that no one has been able to enter or exit using teleportation magic. The player, of course, can come and go as he pleases, though he can't target a location more specific than the point he left the city. This is probably due to this ability being linked to the fact that the main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is a proto-god at that point</span>.
</li><li> It is also possible to go past most of the Undercity plot by simply bribing the guards at the entrance (exit) and most other dungeons can be severely shortened through use of the transformation-teleport bug.
</li><li> And unofficially, one of the most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">mods</a> for <em>Shadows of Amn</em> is an NPC that justs teleports you and your party to the end of the opening dungeon with any worthwhile items, quest hooks, and the equivalent gold roughly equal to the market value of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">junk that you could have picked off each damned corpse</a> as well as a bunch of experience points. Because in a game with very high replay value, after a few times through, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">that dungeon really is that boring.</a>
</li><li> On that note, several mods also exist for other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">RPGs</a> that allow the player to skip <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a> while still gaining all the things they could've obtained by playing through that level.

<ul><li> The third episode of the expansion's Nightelf campaign involved finding the current "evildoer" inside a complicated (but still pretty linear dungeon) then escaping before the timer runs out, using the main character's blink ability, which allows her to teleport short distances and even go through walls, as long as the destination was previously revealed. during the escape only, a hidden room is revealed, right next to the entry hall. The player can blink into the room, then through the wall, skipping almost half the dungeon.

<ul><li> Possible in many dungeons if you use an all-stealth group. Having all druids is most effective, as they can occupy any slot in a group (tank, healer, DPS). Though Blizzard got a bit crafty recently and allowed some of the enemies to detect stealth.
</li><li> Rogues (and anyone with the Engineering or Blacksmithing professions) can pick the locks of some doors that ordinarily require keys found on bosses in that dungeon. Others can't be picked, however, and there's no way to tell except by trying.
</li><li> Some dungeons however are designed in a way that lets player skip some bosses. The Botanica being the most notable since you can skip <em>every</em> boss, but given the ease of most of them, its pretty pointless to do so. They are the ones that give the nice loot, after all. In addition, crafty players have found ways to bypass several normal enemies with various tricks, although the usefulness of some are debatable. And one of these, the infamous wall-walking bug, was almost entirely patched out of the game after a number of rather blatant exploits.
</li><li> Indeed, the Deadmines fall under this trope — but only so far: when the players reach the big evil's ship, rather than wading through hordes of henchmen, they can simply hang a left and move right on to the miniboss via the edges of the cavern and a conveniently-placed slope.
</li><li> There's another anti-stealth technique used by some encounters, in which a boss will summon all the monsters you haven't yet defeated in the nearby area to assist it, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarious</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyWipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyWipe">consequences</a>.
</li><li> Many dungeons have some bosses that are optional in this sense, that they are in an alcove or side room and you can clearly go on to later bosses without even disturbing them. A smaller number of dungeons, though, have small, nonintuitive, easy-to-miss, often one-way paths that let players circumvent content. This often requires jumping off a ledge, such as in Blackrock Depths, lower Blackrock Spire and the Slave Pens. Sometimes, like in the Slave Pens, if you don't jump at exactly the right angle it's possible to miss the ledge you're aiming for and make a lethal drop or simply fall below your goal and have to run back the long way.
</li><li> Levels 60 to 77 were originally designed for players who didn't yet have flying mounts, but later allowed the use of flying mounts anyway. This meant quests that involve killing a specific NPC, normally requiring you to fight through a large number to mooks in the way, could simply be flown over. Levels 86 and up had similar setups—<em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, like prior expansions, didn't let you have a flying mount for the area until you hit the level cap, and flying mounts in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> or <em>Legion</em> weren't available until the correct patch happened, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">and the players had to jump through some hoops even then</a> (but at least once flying mounts for an area were unlocked for one character, they were unlocked for the entire account).
</li><li> Attunement for Blackwing Lair and the Molten Core raids allowed players to teleport directly into the instances, whose actual entrances were located deep inside other dungeons.
</li><li> The underground layout of AQ40 is such that the stairs on which you fight the first boss are directly above the chamber just before the final boss. One guild decided to use a third party hack tool to remove the stair's texture<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ebhl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ebhl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ebhl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Classic was well known for faulty seams in ground textures and virtually every player could share at least 1 occurrence of them falling through the world into the void beneath</span> allowing them to jump down the whole and bypass everything between the 1st and last bosses. Predictably, retribution was fierce with the Ban Hammer being applied to every member of the guild.
</li><li> Starting with <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> many raids include quests to kill certain raid bosses, which in turn creates a portal or unlocks a door to later portions of the raid. This allows guilds that have no interest in killing the early, easy bosses to skip right over them.
</li><li> Amusingly averted in one situation. During the legendary ring questline one sequence involves a lengthy stealth mission in an Iron Horde base. If the player attempts to skip this by flying over in any way, the quest giver teleports them back and snaps that this is a <em>stealth</em> mission.

<ul><li> <em>Dawn of War: Dark Crusade</em>: During the Space Marine stronghold mission an early optional objective allows you to direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">orbital bombardments</a> from the <em>Litany of Fury</em> by co-opting the Blood Ravens' communications. The Imperial Guard stronghold has a scanner that gives you line of sight to one point anywhere on the map temporarily. Orbital bombardment can one-shot an enemy stronghold building.
</li><li> The mission is even easier for Tau, whose commander has both long ranged weapons, jet pack and stealth. He can jump over the SM defences and blast the stronghold while remaining hidden from retaliation.
</li><li> The Necron stronghold has a bunch of empty tunnels your forces can use (though you need to discover the tunnel exits to use them), one near your base and one near the Nightbringer. The goal of the mission is to get your hero to drop a bomb at the Nightbringer's room and evacuate before it collapses, which the tunnel makes a lot easier.
</li><li> Eldar are extremely good in this in general, since their vehicles can skim across long distances and over obstacles, and their builder units can teleport across half the map and then build Webway portals that you can teleport your whole infantry army (and <em>your whole base</em> if you feel like it) through.
</li><li> The Necrons can use their Lord's teleportation and immortality from the "Essence of the Nightbringer" skill to do this in the Imperial Guard stronghold. The Necron Lord simply teleports over a set of small islands in a river right to the enemy headquarters (the only structure that needs to be destroyed), activates the Nightbringer mode and gets rid of it; mission complete.
</li><li> In Soulstorm, flyers in general are very good at this. Just fly them straight towards the target, overshoot a bit, then demonstrate the joys of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> to the enemy.
</li><li> The Hive Lord in one of the sequel's expansions is a monstrous creature, meaning it's flagged as a vehicle for the purposes of barging through things. Some of the missions were designed without taking this into account, meaning that the Hive Lord can counter-flank ambushes or take massive shortcuts just by smashing through a vehicle-breakable wall.

<ul><li> Can be done on any mission that does not require every foe on the map to be defeated as long as the players have Stealth or at least one has Stealth and the ability to teleport their teammates to their location. Stealth can be taken by any character by level 6, and the Stalker archetype has it as a required power at level 1. However, some enemies later in the game have + perception powers that allow them to see through stealth as well as some maps featuring obstacles that will suppress stealth if the player gets too close to them.
</li><li> In the final mission of the Katie Hannon task force, players are expected to beat their way through hordes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Red Caps</a>, find a captured witch, and get her out through wave after wave of ambushes. This happens on an outdoor map, though, and the witch is capable of flying. As a result, it's become standard practice to fly to the witch, blow away her captors, and fly her out.
</li><li> The old trial in the Hollows has two stages: fighting your way through the tunnels to the door to the cave, then facing a single massive room full of monsters between you and the eight triggers that have to be pressed simultaneously. You have 90 minutes to complete it. If someone on the team has a stealth power and Recall (teleporting someone to your position), they can get to the door and quickly teleport everyone there. Once everyone goes through the door, then do the same thing for each of the triggers (teleporting one teammate to each). Click the triggers, trial over in a few minutes, and quite likely zero enemies having to be fought.
</li><li> There's also an Enhancement (a sort of power upgrade) which can be slotted to Sprint, an ability earned at level 1 - and which gives the character a sort of partial invisibility as long as Sprint is active. It stacks with <em>Stealth</em>, the level 6 Concealment skill, for a single power slot used... and then you can get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Recall Friend,</a></em> to pull other members of your team towards the single objective.
</li><li> On the Oranbega maps, some portals are bugged so they send you to a random portal rather than the partner portal on the other side of the wall. If you get lucky, it's possible to be sent from a portal just inside the map entrance to one just outside the room with the mission objective(s).

Eventually, units can be outfitted with flying armour and weapons powerful enough to punch through the hull of a U.F.O - making it possible to simply blast your way into the bridge.
</li><li> Early in the game, clearing a house or even a stable of aliens can be very dangerous and time consuming. A simpler tactic is to throw a Heavy Explosive against a wall to make a hole and then fire exploding and/or incendiary ammunition into the building. This will clear out any walls or any other obstructions that can hide an alien. Any surviving aliens will end up in clear line of sight of your soldiers.

<ul><li> In the level "Assault on the Control Room", in the last quarter of the level, you encounter a group of Covenant Grunts, Jackals, and Elites. One of the Elites is piloting a Banshee, a flying vehicle. However, until they see you, they aren't doing anything in particular. One well-aimed shot with a plasma pistol, and you can take out the pilot of the Banshee, and wreck havoc on all Covenant forces between you and the final room. Other methods include either hanging on to your sniper rifle so you can kill the pilot before he hops in (you can even kill the pilot of the second Banshee further down the bridge), or using a rocket launcher to flip the Banshee over so he can't get in it.
</li><li> Even before that, on the first bridge you cross in "AotCR", you can hug the cliff all the way down to the bottom. The rest of the enemies will not spawn so you skip about 95% of all the fighting in the level.
</li><li> With a lot of practice and luck, you can even get a Banshee on "AotRC" just after you reach the first tank. A well-placed rocket launcher to the bottom of the platform high up on the chasm wall will knock off the Banshee sitting above it. You can jump in and fly your way through the rest of the level! It works because the vehicle spawns with the level, but the pilot doesn't spawn until you've walked farther into the next area. You can actually fly back and find a very lonely, very angry elite waiting where his ride should be.
</li><li> "The Silent Cartographer" has the semi-famous "Squally's Jump." When you go back to the door you unlocked there's a ledge that triggers a cutscene showing off the near-bottomless pit. To the right, you can see the side of the complex you would be fighting through, and on the bottom floor, you can see an <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeal">Overcharge</a>. It's possible with good aim (or the fact that the game autosaves there) to land on it and take no damage. It also lets you sneak up on and kill two Elites guarding the way you were supposed to come from. The downside is, all those enemies you skipped by jumping? They stay there, and are joined by the enemies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag">spawn in</a> after reaching the titular Silent Cartographer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Hope you're ready for a fight.</a>
</li><li> There's another spot on "TSC" where a door is meant to close before you can get to it. The intention is that you are entering on foot - with a warthog, you won't be slowed down by the enemies between you and the door, and with good timing and driving skills, you can wedge the warthog in the doorway, forcing the door to stay open. If you're also lucky, it's far enough through for you to hop out on the other side, bypassing having to fight your way to and through the back door.
</li><li> There are in fact many more examples which can be found throughout the game, like another one in ''Assault on the Control Room" where you hug the wall down a huge valley, allowing you to take a ride in the Pelican dropship straight to the Scorpion tank.

Presumably for balance reasons, Absolute Mover ended up being limited to a single Pokemon in Explorers, while the Mobile Scarf became the sole method of wall walking in Gates to Infinity and gained the harmful side effect of rapidly reducing a Pokemon's HP for every turn it spends in a wall.

Scaring shopkeepers tends to bring in enemy soldiers. However, doing all the respect-earning tasks first, like finding Plot Devices and assassination missions can gain sufficient respect that most shopkeepers don't summon bodyguards. And -that- gains respect as well, allowing much of the game to be bypassed with no shooting whatsoever. In other words, playing like a real mafia man.

<ul><li> The game is full of dungeons based upon puzzles, genuinely blocking the endpoint with high walls. Thanks to the game's physics-based abilities, it's a common trick to jump into the air, drop a bomb underneath <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Link</a>, equip a shield for surfing on, then get knocked further upward by the exploding bomb.

Level 2 also has a shortcut to the red key, which also allows you to go through the rest of the level backwards.

</li><li> Older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> games often had methods to bypass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quests</a> or large chunks of levels, some deliberate and some accidental, that could only be used by clever players or those with a firm grasp on Lara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> acrobatics and platforming. The Colliseum for example has a <em>massive</em> skip where it's possible to gingerly drop into a pit with spikes without being skewered on them, effectively bypassing an entire segment of battling lions, while Palace Midas can be cut in half by a player who has a firm grasp on jumping from sharp-angled platforms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em> had several of these, but they often resulted in you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">missing out on secrets</a>, all of which were required to access the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel">Secret Level</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaI">Ultima I</a></em> had spells which allowed you to instantly travel one floor up or one floor down inside a dungeon. Using these, you could skip all the dungeons entirely by simply spellcasting your way down to the appropriate level, killing whatever quest monster you were sent there for, then spellcasting your way back to the surface. Later games kept the spells, but subverted the trope by making your objectives in the dungeons more complex.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em>, each dungeon presents two objectives: a magic stone somewhere inside, and the altar rooms, which hold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupons">Plot Coupons</a> and connect to multiple dungeons. However, a secret passage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in Lord British's Castle</span> will allow you to skip straight to the bottom level of Dungeon Hythloth, whereby all three altar rooms can be accessed. The stones still take some doing, but since the altar rooms connect the bottom floors of all seven dungeons, and the stones tend to be on the lower floors...
</li><li> One achievement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JettRocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JettRocket">Jett Rocket</a></em> tasks you to complete an Atoll level in under 20 seconds.

Particularly since there was a water spell that flooded the map, giving them even more water to have an advantage with. Subverted in the mission which requires you to go through an underground tunnel under some mountains. If you try to go over the mountains instead, you'll run into a very aggressive red dragon. Also, even if you somehow managed to defeat the dragon, it actually takes longer than going the normal way because mountains give you a movement penalty.

Getting on top of it allows the player to essentially run around it until they reach the back of the level, jumping into a teleporter to let them skip to the second half of the level. (Using this, and an alternate dungeon bypass on Grelbin, one is capable of skipping the Hypnomatic fetch quest, which includes large chunks of Smolg and even <em>completely skipping</em> Allgon City, Damosel.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a></em> is perhaps the most egregious example in the series, with a couple tricks taking advantage of physics with a well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>. The first of which is the Hyper Strike (when Ratchet slams his wrench down in midair), which gives you added height <em>and</em> length to your jump. A few areas in the game can be sequence broke by making a hyper strike in the right place, just barely getting over a wall or gap.
</li><li> The most well-known, however, is the Razor-Claws glitch. (A weapon that, while cool, did not make it into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime">A Crack In Time</a></em>, for obvious reasons.) The weapon allows one to climb walls, which can turn platform heavy levels into a case of "Climb a wall, walk/glide over the level, land at the end/in the boss' area" followed by "Fly to next level. Rinse and repeat."

It allowed players to permanently destroy dungeon walls, letting them bypass tough enemies and other obstacles.

Be aware, though, that while it's relatively easy to pass into the Void, it's rather more complex to get back out of it. These "features" live on in later Bethesda games, with the "tcl" (toggle clipping) console command. This is also possible, if one is lucky, to do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em>: notably, using a certain scroll which enhances your jump skill to ludicrous levels may allow you to jump through ceilings, and land in other areas of the dungeon.

At least one level in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippySlideyIceWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippySlideyIceWorld">Blizzard Castle</a> seems to encourage this to get around a particularly vicious slide.

<ul><li> The 6th Terran mission in has you rescuing a downed ship in the center of the map, surrounded by a ring of mountains. The game expects you, with your base in the east, to circle around clockwise to the west, taking you through the enemy bases on the way before you ascend the mountains around the ship and fight your way down to it. But if you put some units along the cliffs to the west and get sight up there with an air unit or a comsat sweep, they can kill a couple of anti-air turrets to create a safe landing zone for you to ferry them up there and fight a much shorter, much easier way to the ship. Alternatively, the downed ship has two worker units, some mechs and two bunkers defending it—destroying one of the bunkers gives you room to build a barracks, and you can fight your way out from the inside.
</li><li> The 7th mission can be completed in about thirty seconds by simply casting "Defense Matrix" on the SCV with the Psi Emitter and sending him directly to the beacon in the enemy's base. The right route there results in very few defenders in your way, and with the Defense Matrix they can't kill the SCV in time before he gets to the beacon.
</li><li> The 7th Protoss mission is a terrible pain, pitching you against three strategically positioned enemy bases, but you only have to destroy a single building to win. Instead of building up your base and taking out theirs as is expected, you can simply utilize the Dark Templar's invisibility and go kill the objective in about five minutes, as long as you take the right way in that lets you bypass most of their defenses.
</li><li> In the expansion pack, a mission has you escorting a leader unit to a beacon in the middle of the enemy base. If you take along an escort unit or two to clear the anti-air turrets on the way, you can use a Shuttle to fly her to the beacon, bypassing the enemy base entirely.

If you have the Deep Striking ability, you can send some Ghosts directly to the ship and nuke the three target structures. Lacking that, pack some heavy ordnance into the transports and fly them along the map edges, bypassing the base and facing only minimal resistance.
</li><li> One of Zeratul's missions has you destroying three targets inside of a very well defended Protoss base. Building up the necessary forces to destroy the defenses is time consuming, difficult and requires a lot of skill. Simply creating seven or eight Dark Templar to bypass the minimal detection is quick and relatively easy.

Some quests, such as the fox quest in Amatsu which is necessary to access the dungeon are nearly impossible without getting around the hordes of hydras guarding the shrine. Seeing as how this dungeon was the best way to gain levels for a new acolyte becoming a priest it made poor acolytes spend half an afternoon trying to get lucky enough with their teleport skill to bypass the hydras. The Abyss Lake dungeon normally requires a set of dragon parts to enter, one for everyone. A lucky teleport can dump you on the island with the entry and save some of those parts, though it doesn't open unless somebody does it the right way. The undisputed Kings/Queens of the Dungeon Bypass, however, are the Taekwon classes. Using the High Jump skill they are more than capable of jumping over walls as long as teleporting is permitted, even indoors. While a lucky teleport will get you there faster if it comes up early, jumping over walls is more reliable.

This doesn't work as well as you'd think, because the early-game areas don't have monsters that automatically attack players, so a surprising number of newbs ignore the quest chains, walk through the low-level areas without fighting anything and gaining experience, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">then wonder why all the enemies in the higher-level areas suddenly aggro and oneshot them</a>.

This allows for several bypasses, most notably in the Castle segment of the game.

<ul><li> Strongholds and dungeons appear in the procedurally-generated terrain, and since any player is going to be equipped with a pickaxe one might think the walls of the dungeon would present no obstacle at all. But, to make the player think twice about breaking down a wall, the stone-brick block that comprises the dungeon walls are randomly populated with identical-looking blocks containing Silverfish, a vicious swarming enemy that can cut even an armored player down in numbers, and that tends to make more of itself when attacked.
</li><li> For ocean monuments, the devs went a step further—besides the greatly reduced mining speed underwater (which can be eliminated with enchantments), each one of these fortresses includes three boss monsters who (using a lovely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a>) repeatedly inflict you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusEffect">Status Effect</a> that reduces mining speed by a ridiculous 99.73%, making tunneling through the structure virtually impossible until you track down and kill the bosses. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">Some players just take this as a challenge</a>, though, and come up with alternate strategies, such as using glitchy tricks to set off TNT underwater and blast their way through, or stockpiling milk and drinking it to nullify the status effect every time it's applied.

These would generally be quite tough, since everyone involved - you included - would be driving the exact same car. There was also a LOT of them. Players tired of trying to beat the near-perfect AI in every race soon found alternate solutions - while the street-races took away all of your main weapons (preventing you from just bringing a rocket-launcher to the party), you were still left with your default handgun, and a single shot to the gas-tank cap would instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">detonate a car</a>. So once the race has started, you just park your car in some nice, out-of-the-way place, and start lifting any large, heavy objects you can find to build a barricade across the track. When the AI cars finish the first lap and get tangled up in your barrier, you shoot out as many as you can. If any get through, well, you now have several wrecked cars you can use to improve your barricade for the next lap. With all other racers destroyed, you just need to open a hole in the barricade, and then hot-lap your way to victory.

But one of them, the Sixth Mirror, has no name — and is portable, so nobody knows its location. Much of the game is spent searching for it, only to discover that it's been claimed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Lord Xeen. Cue epic rush through his massive castle to reach him and stop him from using it for his nefarious plans... or, if you're smart, cue walking to one of the other five mirrors and typing "Lord Xeen", which teleports you to him instantly. You can even do this right at the start of the game before you should know it'll work, although that's likely to get your lowly level one party murdered by Lord Xeen.

Instead of making peace with the Lizard Men living in the Middle Mountains, you can just lure the ones near the dragon to kill them elsewhere, and then just sneak the dragon. Similarly, you can avoid the quest for freezing the lake by taking a side path that goes around the lake. There are some Lizard Men there, but you should have killed many of them already by that point, and they're anyway weaker than the skeletons you're forced to fight to get the crystal required to freeze the lake.

However, by that point, you have a glide ability that allows you to slowly but surely reach areas across gaps.

For example, upon coming into contact with a lip on the edge of the ground, the player will be popped upwards, and will fall back down. In certain situations, this may be used to completely bypass a handful of the more annoying levels of the game.

They figure they can be clever by just going around and using the back entrance, which indeed takes them right to the boss, who complains about how they completely avoided all of his lethal traps and mazes. Later, though, it's revealed that the front door to the dungeon led to an empty room with no enemy encounters which led directly to the boss chamber, meaning that sneaking around the back way actually forced the party to fight more enemies than they would have if they had taken the front door.

While it can save time and strokes, there's usually more challenge involved, and you risk landing out-of-bounds, incurring a penalty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntitledGooseGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntitledGooseGame">Untitled Goose Game</a></em> has a glitch that allows you to clip up insurmountable slopes or through closed gates by wiggling toward them while repeatedly dropping and picking up an item until you get past.

You don't have to enter the forest, or the cave, face Pamela Voorhees, or light the fireplaces. All you actually have to do is keep the children in the lakeside cabin alive and defeat Jason three times to win the game. All those extra tasks do is provide you with better weapons and Pamela's sweater which in effect doubles that one counsellor's health. In fact, a careful player can get his hands on the machete or torch without doing any of the dungeons at all. The former can be found by killing 60 zombies and the latter can be found at random in a large lakeside cabin after finding the note telling you to look for it, and the machete is a fast weapon that does okay damage to Jason while the latter is a slow one that does as much damage to Jason as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">the pitchfork</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse">Trojan Horse</a> is history's most famous example. Forget trying to break down the mighty Trojan Door or Walls, we'll convince them to open the Door and let us in!
</li><li> The Israeli army has developed tactics for urban warfare that probably count as an example of this trope. Instead of going through booby-trapped streets and narrow alleys in which troops may be exposed to sniper fire, Israeli soldiers literally <em>walk through walls</em>, using explosives to create passageways through houses and other buildings.
<ul><li> This sounds not dissimilar to an event on the Green Line in Nicosia (the divided capital of Cyprus). Reputedly, the local Turkish contingent were suspected of discreetly expanding a blockhouse so it extended into the UN secure zone. The local UN commander responded by going on patrol one morning... driving a bulldozer.
</li><li> In actuality that tactic (often called mouse-holing) predates both of the previous examples. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> this was used as early as the Battle of Stalingrad. Another related ancient military tactic is undermining, digging a tunnel beneath an enemy stronghold to either knock it down or blow it up.
<ul><li> Notably this happened during the Siege of Petersburg during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. Union troops dug a mineshaft underneath the Confederate lines and set off a sizable stash of explosives. Death From Below, pretty much. The resulting fight was dubbed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Battle of the Crater</a>.
</li><li> The Battle of the Crater was <em>supposed</em> to have been a Dungeon Bypass, and it would have worked if General Burnside had been allowed to stick with his original plan: big explosion, specially-trained troops from the United States Colored Troops go around the crater (as opposed to <em>into</em> it), bypass the remaining defenses, and open the road to Petersburg. And then Meade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">stepped in</a>, replaced the well-trained USCT regiments with others that had no idea what would happen, denied Burnside the use of an electrical detonator so that his engineers had to use an umpty-thousand-foot-long <em>rope</em> as fuse, and...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">yeah</a>. Oh, and Meade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">managed to deflect all of the blame onto Burnside, too</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to an extreme in the 2009 Israel/Gaza conflict. According to the accounts of some Israeli soldiers, Hamas gunmen and suicide bombers attempted to lure them into houses most likely rigged with booby traps. Instead of taking the bait, Israeli soldiers simply just knocked down the houses with bulldozers.
</li><li> Also, American troops in Iraq often face insurgents who, when charged, run and hide inside a building they hope to defend, at which point the Americans promptly call in an airstrike. The situation's so common it's earned its own unofficial acronym. (AWR, for Allah's Waiting Room.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, the Germans executed the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan">Schlieffen Plan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: the indirect invasion of France via Belgium, and nearly reached Paris. Some French generals had proposed to do the same thing in case of a war with Germany, but the French never adopted it.
<ul><li> The war ended in 1918 when the Germans realized that the Italians were about to do it on the largest scale <em>ever</em>: the Central Empires' plan called for Austria-Hungary to negotiate peace and Germany to fight through the winter and get good conditions for the peace, but then the Italians <em>collapsed the Austro-Hungarian Empire</em> and got unlimited access to their territory, meaning that the Germans had to give up to the German Revolution happening in the meantime and surrender before <em>over one million soldiers</em> marched all the way to Berlin effectively uncontested (most of the German army was stuck in France, and what remained back home was tied up with the mutinies).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>:
<ul><li> The popular version of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France">Battle of France<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is that the Germans executed a massive Dungeon Bypass by invading through Belgium to avoid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaginotLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaginotLine">Maginot Line</a>. If that's your preconception, then the actual history <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts</a> this: the French built the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaginotLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaginotLine">Maginot Line</a> precisely because they wanted the Germans to go through Belgium. But the French expected this would be the <em>northern</em> Belgian plains, so they sent their best forces there, while the Germans executed the true Dungeon Bypass of the campaign by going through the Ardennes forest in <em>southern</em> Belgium, which the French believed could never be penetrated with mechanized forces. See the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaginotLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaginotLine">Useful Notes entry on the Maginot Line</a>.
</li><li> The Maginot Line worked <em>exactly as intended</em> - it prevented attack from the east into the French heartland and was never penetrated. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> example: When the Allies were pushing into Germany near the end of the war, the depleted German army were trying to drag it out into city fighting in each town along the way, and were trying to coerce the populace to fight to the last man. Upon taking fire from the town, the Allied troops backed off to a safe distance and called in artillery strikes to reduce the entire town to rubble. When they reached the next town in line, they were usually greeted by the Mayor waving a white flag and the few remaining German troops having either fled the area or been haphazardly captured by the civilians as a sort of bribe for the Allied army.
</li><li> Averted by the Market-Garden operation. It would've been a bypass if it had succeeded, as it would allow going around the Siegfried line. However, the operation failed. Out of 41000 airborne troops deployed, 17000 died. Oh, and the Nazis punished the Dutch who supported this operation, letting thousands of them starve to death the following winter.
</li><li> Happened (again) on a larger scale (much, MUCH MUCH larger scale) during WWII when the Americans dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki rather than fight their way across Japan.
<ul><li> B-29s, including the bombers that dropped the A-bombs, were the first mass produced pressurized aircraft. This allowed them to fly much higher than competing designs, so high in fact that they could simply fly over Japan's air defenses and the air defenses couldn't attack back.
</li></ul></li><li> The entirety of the Allied island-hopping strategy: why dig Japanese garrisons out of every little island they've taken when you can cut them off from reinforcement, bomb anything they could use to attack you directly to rubble, and simply move on to the next island. (Stranded Japanese soldiers continued to camp in their outposts for years, sometimes decades, afterward, since they received no new orders and couldn't trust radio broadcasts saying the war was over — if their radios even still worked.) Of course, when they needed to clear out an island for whatever reason (Iwo Jima, for example), the result was a dungeon adventure akin to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TombOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TombOfHorrors">Tomb of Horrors</a></em>.
</li><li> During the Soviet advance on Berlin, the Nazis built three enormous <em>Flaktürme</em> (flak towers) around the city that doubled as emergency shelters for thousands of people. These were effectively castles with 3.5 meter-thick reinforced concrete walls ringed with heavy flak turrets that could depress to sweep the streets below. They proved impenetrable even to heavy bombardment from tank squads, so the Soviets ended up just ignoring them and going after juicier targets, then negotiating a surrender from the <em>Flaktürme</em> later.
</li><li> Defied by Rommel and the Normandy landings on D-day. Rommel correctly guessed the general area and type of beaches the allies would try to land on and insisted on having them fortified. It's quite possible that without Rommel the D-day landings would have been opposed by a tiny group of German troops playing football or sleeping in lawn chairs, without any obstacles or bunkers.
</li></ul></li><li> In the city of Telmissus in Asia Minor, an ox-cart was said to be tied either to a post or its own shaft with a fiendishly complicated knot by the cart's owner, a man named Gordias; the knot itself became known as the Gordian Knot. It was said that whoever could untie the knot would conquer the world. Alexander the Great managed to untie it by cutting it in two with his sword. (This is the legendary version usually told; the real version is not so simple. In a sense, the story as told is something of a Dungeon Bypass for the story as it actually happened.)
</li><li> Police SWAT teams discovered that getting past a door with many locks on it was a problem, so they just use a shotgun to blast out the hinges.
</li><li> The Berlin Airlift. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">Soviet Union</a> decided to control Berlin by cutting off all supplies coming into the city from the West by road and train. Instead of trying to recapture a corridor of land between West Germany and West Berlin, allied nations decided to just <em>fly</em> over.
</li><li> When the Mongols decided to conquer China, they faced the Great Wall, a series of fortifications designed specificially to keep them out. Rather than fighting their way through it or riding around it, they took advantage of the Song Dynasty's unstable political climate, made a few allies within China, and bribed their way in.
</li><li> A similar tactic got the Crusaders, and later the Turks, into Constantinople. It's a heavily walled city, but if the emperor needs an army and you happen to have a horde of barbarian mercenaries for hire...
</li><li> While the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kazan">Siege of Kazan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1552 was your typical siege involving thousands of troops (with the Russians outnumbering the defending Tatars) and hundreds of cannons, the city was only taken when the attackers secretly dug a tunnel under a defensive wall and planted charges, blowing a huge hole in it. Later, Ivan the Terrible, who commanded the Russian forces, decided to safeguard Moscow from the same tactics by ordering basements to be built under each defense tower with copper plates mounted on walls. During sieges, people with good hearing would be sent into these rooms to listen for sounds of digging that would be amplified by the plates.
</li><li> One of the factors that contributed to the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">Fall of Constantinople<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (thus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople">Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</a>) was the failure of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade">Naval Blockade</a> by the Christian defenders of the city. Not because Sultan Mehmed II broke through the blockade with his famed cannons, but because the Sultan transported his fleet overland: he <em>ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across Galata on the north side of the Golden Horn, and rolled his ships across</em>.
</li><li> The above example is also one of the reason the infamous Vikings were such feared raiders and capable traders. Their light, flat and yet sea-capable boats, could be lifted out of the water and transported over short distances on land with relative ease, essentialy allowing them to go from shoreline into rivers or from river to river, saving time or bypassing defences. One of the most famous examples was using rivers in todays Schleswig-Holstein in Germany. By moving short distances over land between rivers they could go from the eastern sea to the norther sea and vis versa, bypassing most the entire coasts of Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark saving weeks or months of travel along dangerous coasts.
</li><li> A typical tactic of siege warfare is to dig a tunnel under the wall of the besieged fortress / city and then collapse or blow it up to destroy the wall under it, or to just dig a tunnel inside and open the main gate by surprise.
<ul><li> The siege of Rochester Castle, for example, involved digging a mine under the wall, then slathering it with the fat of forty pigs and setting it on fire. The heat-induced expansion of the stone and the ignition of the wooden foundations caused a section of the wall to collapse. This was amplified and dramatized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ironclad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ironclad">Ironclad</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">burning the pigs alive</a>.
</li><li> The "blow it up tunnel" was adapted to trench warfare twice:
<ul><li> The first was in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Battle of the Crater</a>: Union general Burnside decided to try it and then, as the Confederates were still stunned by the explosion, have general Ferrero's black division charge at the sides of the crater to breach Petersburg's defence lines. Sadly, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Meade protesting the use of black troops for political reasons</a>, Ferrero's division was replaced at the last moment with Ledlie's 1st Division, with the drunkard general failing to brief his men on the battle plan. Ledlie's division failed to charge immediately after the explosion and charged <em>into</em> the crater, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">and was massacred when the Confederates regrouped and started shooting in the crater</a>;
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> the British army reused the tactic at the Battle of Messines, where they detonated <em>nineteen</em> such mines under the German trenches. Between the much greater quantity of more powerful explosive used, a numerical superiority of almost two-to-one, accurate artillery and tank support and the troops charging in right after the explosions, the attack was successful.
</li><li> Mining under the other side's trenches to blow them up was quite a popular move in World War I by both sides - Messines was just the biggest and most well-known example. (Incidentally, not all the mines were set off. Six were left (older accounts list fewer); one had been put out of action by German countermining and it was decided that the others were not needed after all. One of them was dug up after the war, one of them was struck by lightning in 1955, and the other four are still there...
</li><li> The masters of this kind of warfare during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> were the Italian and Austro-Hungarian mountain troops, that found smarter to dig under enemy-held mountains (mainly the ones known as Italian Tooth and Austrian Tooth facing each other on the Dolomites) and <em>blow them up</em> rather than trying a frontal assault. Usually there wasn't enough explosive to actually blow up the mountain, just the piece the enemy was on, but the final mine to explode was fifty tonnes of TNT that <em>did</em> collapse part of the Italian Tooth... Just in time to force the Italian to not detonate the equally large they had just completed right under the Austrian Tooth. After that, the (locally raised) troops stopped for fear of blowing up the whole mountain range and their homes with it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> has dug a number of invasion tunnels as a means of bypassing the hideously-fortified DMZ (among other things, it currently stands as <em>the world's largest minefield</em>) if they ever invade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">South Korea</a>. Four of these have been discovered so far. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">There may be even more.</a>
</li><li> Many people who are concerned about security concentrate on securing their door so it can't be broken into by buying a metal door and/or putting a dozen locks on it. Some take the next logical step to put bars on their windows. However, these strategies tend to leave glaring weaknesses. Doors may have all the locks in the world but if the door is installed so that it swings outward rather than inward, it will leave the door hinges exposed. The pins holding the hinges together can easily be removed with a screwdriver and a hammer.
