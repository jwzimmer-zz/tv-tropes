</p><p>The laws of physics are frequently ignored in service to the story, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableTerminalVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableTerminalVelocity">someone taking a plunge from a great height</a> being probably the most frequent offender. Writers tend to forget that it's not the fall that kills you... it's the sudden stop at the end. Or to put it another way, your velocity can't hurt you, until you try to <em>change</em> it.
</p><p>In fiction, however, one must specifically hit the ground to get killed in a fall. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffhanger">Grabbed a ledge?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAFallingStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAFallingStar">Got caught out of midair?</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobotHandsSaveLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobotHandsSaveLives">By a giant robot?</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Hit water instead of ground?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaSpringboard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaSpringboard">Landed on an enemy?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarCushion">On a car?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashLanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashLanding">Fall in a dumpster?</a> Congratulations, you're completely uninjured, no matter how far you fell beforehand!
This is nonsense: you still decelerate from terminal velocity to a dead stop in less than a second, and it is the <em>sudden deceleration</em> of that stop that kills. It makes no difference <em>what</em> specifically causes that sudden deceleration. Sometime this is handwaved by having the victim fall through the branches of trees, which by acting subsequently, will provide a <em>somewhat</em> gradual deceleration.

Trauma from rapid velocity change works both ways. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom">Getting thrown halfway across a city square</a> is pretty much equivalent to standing still and getting hit by a train. Even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> catches you at the other end, you still end up ripped apart like tissue paper by steel-hard fingers pushing at you like jackhammers. If writers considered the way vehicles work, they could avoid this. Don't want your hero bisecting flying civilians? Try having them travel at the same speed and gradually decelerate the target to a more reasonable velocity. Air braking is your friend.
</p><p>This can happen in video games via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>. On the other hand, video games also sometimes invert this, so it is, in fact, the fall that kills you... in mid-air.

<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em>: while in the trapeze, Leon drops May off, lets her fall a bit and then catches her by the hand, but the pull dislocates her shoulder. Later he does the same thing to Sora, but this time she's not injured because she was expecting it, and used her own strength to help Leon lift her.
</li><li> Mokuba tries to rappel his way down a tower using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetLadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetLadder">rope tied together from old bedsheets</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. The rope isn't nearly long enough and comes loose, and he falls a <em>long distance</em> down... into some bushes, which saves him.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Abridged Series version</a> comments "It's a good thing I'm a cartoon!"
</li></ul></li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> averts this. Our hero saves the female lead from a high altitude fall not by catching her in the opened cockpit of his fighter, but by matching her descent before sort of scooping her up. Still pretty crazy, but it <em>had</em> been established that he was a skilled stunt pilot before going military.
</li><li> This pops up all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ImmortalRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ImmortalRain">Immortal Rain</a></em>: when the only way out of trouble is a long way down, Rain scoops up Machika, tucks her under his arm, and jumps. In one scene they escape bounty hunters by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">jumping out of an upper storey of a skyscraper to the city street below</span>; in another, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a train bridge has been destroyed and they jump from the falling train to the canyon floor</span>. The implication is that since Rain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">perfectly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">capable</a> of surviving that fall, anyone cradled in his arms would be safe as well.
</li><li> The characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, not fully knowing how to set the spatial coordinates and thus appearing ten days earlier at several hundred feet in the air. Before hitting the ground, lead wizard Negi used his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Wind Magic</a> to both push the group off the ground and create a cushion of air as well, leaving every character without a scratch. This might have made sense if it were done in a slow descent if not for the fact that it was done at the last second only a dozen metres above the ground. The two heavy-hitters in the group, Kaede and Setsuna were able to survive the fall on their own abilities (they landed on their feet). Problematically in Setsuna's case, she decided to take actions to save Konoka herself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry">Bridal Carrying</a> her on the way down. Setsuna does this routinely to Konoka while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">jumping massive distances</a> without incident anyway (she probably has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki-related</a> method).
<ul><li> Similarly, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewsHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewsHound">School Newspaper News Hound</a> Kazumi Asakura tried to expose the same wizard's magic, that atop his already-built stress at the other events surrounding him at the time caused his Wind abilities to explode through his voice. This sent Asakura into the air, to which Negi flew upward on his staff to catch her by the arm. Maybe justified in that he caught her before she actually started falling, but the strength of lift-off was enough to crack and break her cellphone.

After he does so, he says, "Whew! That's great that my body can reach Mach two! If I was one second slower, she'd have been hit by that 30 km/h bus!" The old lady has been smashed to bits to the point where he has to rebuild her body as a cyborg like him...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">PokÃ©mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Nerves of Steelix", Jasmine leaps off the edge of a cliff and lands on her Steelix's head approximately fifty feet below <em>with absolutely no injuries</em>.
</li><li> At the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon4Ever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon4Ever">PokÃ©mon 4Ever</a></em>, Ash, Pikachu, and the Iron Masked Marauder start to fall to their supposed deaths from thousands of feet in the air. Ash and Pikachu are saved by Celebi, but as for the MarauderÂ…he wasn't so lucky. The Marauder continues to fall to Earth, and just when you were hoping for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">Disney Villain Death</a>, he lands in a tree and continues his fall, breaking a branch along the way. He then falls to the ground and starts to roll down a hill and off a miniature cliff, and somehow survives this.

</li><li> It even happens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">manga</a> from time to time. A particularly egregious case is Sapphire's dismount from her Tropius to catch a falling tree limb - and she survives not just the velocity of the fall (she was dropping from a higher altitude), but also <em>the weight of the limb and the person and PokÃ©mon which she catches on landing</em>! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>, <em>no kidding</em>!

</li><li> Similarly, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> manga and OVA, the Major's elite commander makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandingCoolness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandingCoolness">Commanding Coolness</a> entrance by falling several hundred feet from a zeppelin and landing in a cloud of dust no worse for wear. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's a genuine tough-as-nails badass: a seasoned veteran and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Werewolf</a> to boot.</span>
</li><li> Played straight during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>'s training for the Chuunin Exams. Thrown into a deep chasm, after falling for several minutes he managed to summon a toad large enough to stop his descent... and bouncing off his hard back didn't hurt at all, apparently.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, Russia jumps out of a freaking plane WITHOUT A PARACHUTE because there is snow. Snow will save him. Granted, he does break his arm (in the manga he breaks <em>all of his bones</em>).

The 00 cyborgs can survive being transported by 009's acceleration mode because they are cyborgs, who have been enhanced to be more durable than regular humans. Any normal human who comes into contact with 009 while he's in acceleration mode would be killed instantly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma Â½</a></em>, it's not unheard of for characters to walk away from hundred-meter drops (in one such instance, they even left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpactSilhouette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpactSilhouette">perfect character-shaped holes upon impact</a> after falling off a mountain bridge and all the way to the ground). On one occasion, though, Ranma fell off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">Giant Flyer</a>'s back several hundred meters in the air and was knocked out cold upon landing on a convenient log floating downstream. On another, Ranma, while carrying <em>four</em> girls on his back, blasted himself (and the girls) out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEvil">Garden of Evil</a> up to a height of at least thirty meters, and landed perfectly on his feet... then collapsed in a heap, both legs broken.
<ul><li> In one episode of the anime, Akane gets knocked off the side of a cliff. Ranma runs down the side, gets to the bottom before she does, then catches her in his arms. She's perfectly fine afterwards. This is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma Â½</a></em> after all.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reconstructional</a> attempt in the second movie, when Mousse has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostVictoryCollapse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostVictoryCollapse">Post-Victory Collapse</a> in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> liberation of abducted Shampoo. He falls off large height past never-asked-to-be-saved Shampoo. She grabs him, joining the fall and then she lands seemingly flawlessly onto straight legs (in line with own cat motif), following with immediate and fluid transit into crouching position and kneeling all the while decelerating and laying unconscious Mousse to rest on the wooden floor. Everyone is a martial artist of worth there, so the legwork goes as means of absorbing the landing impact, with a pinch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> of strain it would cause to bodies of both parties regardless.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 22 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Lucy jumps out of a jail cell that is at least a skyscraper in height off the ground and Natsu catches her. Amusingly, Lucy (who is a normal human besides her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>) is unharmed, while Natsu (who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a> besides his magic) is briefly knocked silly.
</li><li> Used scientifically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GambleFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GambleFish">Gamble Fish</a></em>, Tomu was able to survive the fall by making sure he hit the branches to slow down and the fact that there was a large amount of fresh snow at the bottom to land on. However, he did add the fact this only gave him a 1/10 chance of actually surviving the fall compared to the slim chance if he didn't. He is a gambler after all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Ed slips off a snowy ledge and plummets fifty feet, landing through the roof of a wooden shed full of soggy dynamite. His only reaction is "RrrghÂ… <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">falling like that's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">gonna stunt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse">my growth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">even more</a>!!"

He hurts his leg a little when he lands (no one catches <em>him</em>), but that's taken care of by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Ureshiko's magic</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, Matsuda has to fake his own death by falling from a building. He's saved by the other members of the investigation team with a <em>mattress</em> placed some floors below. Exactly how he manages to land right on it is a mystery. And he's perfectly fine after the fall, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Almost every character has fallen off a cliff at least once, but by far the most egregious example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Kikyo</a>. Early on in the series, this was her primary means of exit; she would fall off a cliff, be presumed dead, then show up two episodes later and fall off another cliff, causing no end of drama with Inuyasha. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">what is dead may never die</a>, regardless of how many cliffs you fall from.</span>
</li><li> Inuyasha himself falls off no end of high places; given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">practical indestructibility</a>, this is to be expected. This trope comes in to play when he is trapped in human form and <em>then</em> falls off a cliff in one of the mid-series episodes. In the anime, he is caught by the demon tree they were fighting (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">long story</a>), but in the manga, he lands in a tree at the base of the cliff and awakens when the sun rises and he reverts.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer">The Devil Is a Part-Timer!</a></em>, an unconscious Chiho is thrown out of the sky by Lucifer. Emi runs up and catches her. Interestingly, Chiho is unharmed, while the impact <em>breaks Emi's legs</em>.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> chapter, Ataru accidentally cushioned the fall of a young woman who was trying to commit suicide. A random onlooker even noted how really unlikely it was that Ataru could survive something like that, given the height the girl jumped from (and it turned out he was correct; it was actually the work of a demon who was trying to make Ataru more popular).
</li><li> In a side-story of Masahiko Nakahira's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StreetFighter">Sakura Ganbaru!</a></em> manga, Karin Kanzuki ends up fighting a rival on top of a plane, both of them attached to the hull via safety cables. When they inevitably fall, Karin saves both their lives by wrapping one end of the cable around her arm, and then, a dozen feet before splattering on the pavement, whipping the <em>other</em> end across the width of a pedestrian bridge to wrap around a streetlight. The momentum swings Karin and her rival in a wide arc <em>beneath</em> the bridge, wraps the streetlight around the bridge and rips it off the sidewalk, and gently deposits both girls on the street, with a completely aghast Sakura (who watched the whole thing from the ground) staring in stupefaction. And Karin's arm and hand weren't even rope-burned, let alone dislocated or torn off.
</li><li> Completely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThouShaltNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThouShaltNotDie">Thou Shalt Not Die</a></em>. When Mashiro catches Kuroi and Momoka in midair after they got knocked off the top of the school roof, she has to do some incredible quick thinking since, thanks to her enhanced body, she will survive the landing but Kuroi and Momoka won't even if she catches them before hitting the ground. She solves it by tossing them upward just as they are about to hit and therefore transferring their momentum to herself resulting in her hitting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundShatteringLanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundShatteringLanding">ground even harder</a> but at the same time breaking Kuroi and Momoka's fall. They still get injured, but at least they manage to survive.
</li><li> Happens <em>three times</em> to Ueki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki">The Law of Ueki</a></em>, every time by Kobasen. And every time, the only sign of any injury is Kobasen briefly complaining that it hurts to catch someone from that high up.
<ul><li> In the original manga version, the first time Mr. Kobayashi do that both of his arm bones are broken. Readers are treated with an x-ray view of said bones broken.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLuciferAndBiscuitHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLuciferAndBiscuitHammer">The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer</a></em>. Yuuhi mentions to Hangetsu that he's learned how to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Domain Control</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">jump really high</a>, but he also needs to keep applying it in short bursts when he descends in order to land safely.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>. Asta is launched into the air to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> to stop Noelle's magic running amok. Thing is, once he does so, he and Noelle start falling from a considerable distance. But this was planned: Finral casts a portal spell that reorients them to come out a few feet off the ground but flying <em>horizontally</em>: the worst that happens is Asta sliding along the ground for a bit; they're both okay.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shy">Shy</a></em>. When the titular heroine barely manages to catch a roller coaster car which has been derailed, the girl in the car is put in a coma because of the rabid deceleration, causing public opinion to turn against her and her falling into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSoD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSoD">HeroicBSoD</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nanako</span> falls a considerable distance after being freed from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kunino-sagiri</span>, but neither she nor Yu have a scratch on them after he catches her. Averted in the game, since the boss fight happens after you free her.

He'll sometimes justify it by thinking something to the effect of "I've got to time this right: match my velocity to hers and then gradually slow us," but that doesn't work when they were only seconds from hitting the ground.
<ul><li> Also, he fairly often knocks or grabs people at super speed, making that hilarious effect where whatever they were holding at the time would suddenly be suspended in the air as they disappear between panels. Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker">Emperor Joker</a>,</em> where he accidentally kills Lois this way. She gets better. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Briefly</a>. After the Joker's control over the universe (long story) is defeated, he grabs her this way again, but this time he apparently remembers not to accelerate so fast.
</li><li> Not surprisingly, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superheroes</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">Flight</a> will do the same at one time or another. Realistically, they would have the additional concern of taking injury <em>themselves</em> from colliding with a falling object, which at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">the invulnerable</a> Superman has no concerns about.
</li><li> In Superman's case, this was one of the main justifications for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> "unconscious telekinesis" theory. Later made explicit in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994">Superboy</a>, who learned to control it consciously. One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a></em> issue has a very ill Superman convey to villains they better stand down as he, Superman, no longer has the ability to <em>pull</em> his punches and their heads might just go explodey.
</li></ul></li><li> Same goes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>, who would certainly be giving high G-load injuries to the people he picks up and rushes off with at super-speed, as his acceleration is depicted as nearly instantaneous. Indeed, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin">Speed Force</a> was invented largely to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explain</a>" these kinds of mechanics.
<ul><li> In one issue of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a>, he saves the population of a North Korean town from a nuclear meltdown in about 12 seconds.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Occasionally subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>, with the most well-known case of said subversion being when he attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied">catch Gwen Stacy</a> with his webbing after the Green Goblin tossed her off a bridge, but the sudden stop snapped her neck. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> briefly tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">reverse course</a> on this, saying that it, indeed, <em>was</em> the fall that killed her; that the shock caused her to have a heart attack and die. They even went so far as to edit the prominent <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/Spider-Man_Death-of-Gwen-Stacy.jpg">"SNAP!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>â—Š</small> sound effect out of the panel where Spidey catches Gwen in reprints.
<ul><li> After the "shock of the fall" line (originated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a>) was discredited, the current line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> thinking is that since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a> doesn't really exist, <em>nothing</em> Spidey could reasonably have done at the time could have saved her. Catch her, she snaps. Don't catch her, she splats. In-universe, Spidey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">learned from his mistakes</a>. In a scenario years later where Mary Jane is sent plummeting, he knows to fire his webbing at multiple points, stopping Mary-Jane from getting lethal whiplash. At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>, Spidey repeats the feat again with Ana Maria, claiming that he has practiced it so much that now "he can do it in his sleep". And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a></em> (vol. 2) #21, he catches falling teammates in a soft net of web instead of snaring them with a single line. There's also a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> issue where Spidey manages to save Gwen in this manner, and in a time travel storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a></em>, the younger webslinger tells Peter to stop, jumps past him, embraces Gwen and then uses webbing to slow both of them at the same time, more gently and protecting her neck as they go. She specifically states that Peter spent most of her childhood explaining to her what he wished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">he could have done differently,</a> so she knew <em>exactly</em> how to save Gwen this time.

</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush">Batman: Hush</a></em>, where Batman, after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookGun">Grappling-Hook Gun</a> line is mysteriously broken, attempts to grab onto a ledge, and immediately breaks several bones in his arms, falls further, and breaks the rest of his bones (there was even a bone chip in his skull). Ouch. Thank goodness a friendly brain surgeon was nearby.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a>: Year One</em>, when Barbara Gordon's jumpline, made of normal rope, is cut by Batman before she can hurt herself with the sudden deceleration. She is later given some of the special 'batrope' to use with the explanation that it is elastic and extends/contracts in order to prevent the shock of an instant stop.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> - climbing ropes are elastic for exactly this reason since falls will usually involve at least a few metres of drop before the rope catches you. Unfortunately, this does mean that if you fall near the start of a long climb, the rope may well stretch enough that you still hit the floor, albeit rather more gently than if the rope weren't there. In fact, ropes for many different purposes will generally either be dynamic (i.e. somewhat elastic) or static (ie. not elastic), and it's important to know which you should be using.

At one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WarMachine">War Machine</a> plummets from the sky after his armor is shut down, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Storm">Storm</a> swoops in to save him. She manages to catch him, but the act causes her immense pain, and she notes that it nearly tore her arm out of its socket.

</li><li> While Diana is usually able to catch people safely with her lasso due to the lasso's variable length and resulting ability to behave like is has whatever degree of elasticity is needed she has at least once caused someone severe injuries when stopping their fall with the lasso too abruptly.

In one issue, the villain hurls an innocent bystander towards a building. Miracleman catches the lad, saving the child's life but breaking a few ribs in the process. In the same scene, the acceleration when the villain threw him should have had the exact same effect â€” snapping most of his limbs and his neck, because the villain sure didn't bother about whiplash and such.

The older alien manages to push the right switch a split-second before the human hits the ground. Naturally, the human is perfectly fine, even though he clearly fell at least 5 stories. Then again, we don't know the properties of the anti-gravity beam. If its force is evenly distributed through the body, it could provide extreme deceleration without damage.

This is, however, completely in keeping with how a transporter would have to work, since they would materialize at a stationary point with no preexisting momentum, but the deceleration effect wouldn't apply to the act of being beamed out because it's not quite the same as a force acting on them to slow them down. (The hard impact onto the transporter pad is because they were beamed in <em>above</em> the transporter pad rather than <em>on</em> it, so they have a fall of a few feet complete with the momentum that comes with that â€” enough to make it a little painful, but not enough to do serious harm.)

He fires the gun and then attaches it to his belt. The grappling hook lands in the belfry, slides across the floor and then bites into a bit of stonework, and suddenly Batman and Vicki are suspended in the air, swinging romantically back and forth while searchlights play across the cathedral for no very good reason. All this without a) breaking the stonework, b) breaking off whatever attaches the gun to the belt, c) breaking the belt, d) breaking Batman in half at the waist, or e) tearing Vicki from Batman's arms to go plummeting to her doom.

This is ignoring the fact that they then get swung straight into a stone wall. There is no way <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Batman</span> would be in any fit state to try again after falling once, especially considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how much damage his spine took already</span>.

Between the sudden vertical stop and the sudden horizontal acceleration, Trinity should have been splattered all over his sunglasses. Earlier in the same movie, Neo rescues a couple of people from a roof of a crashed and exploding truck by flying onto the scene, grabbing them by their collars, and pulling them straight up while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball">Out-Flying the fireball</a></em>.

This contrasts heavily with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">Rhodey</a>'s fate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>, where the War Machine suit's reactor is blasted off at cruising altitude, and the now-inert armor is basically a metal coffin as it plummets to the groundâ€”explicitly stating that Tony's various suits <em>need</em> the gigantic amounts of power from their Arc reactors to actively cushion the squishy human inside from kinetic blows just as much as they do to fire repulsor beams or fly.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2">Iron Man 2</a></em>, it's also averted as Tony visibly drops his speed significantly before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grabbing Pepper and flying her away from the exploding Hammeroid</span>.
</li><li> Played painfully straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em>, in the "Barrel of Monkeys" scene. The last victim is caught just before hitting the water and is magically unhurt.
</li></ul></li><li> John McClane falls down a shaft in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> and grabs the edge of an air-vent. Instead of just broken fingers, he gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">acceptable break</a> because he's in an action movie. It turns out the air-vent grab was due to a mistake by the stuntman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Left in</a> because it looks cool, nothing is said on whether the stunt-man got bashed up.
<ul><li> Also, the big action sequence towards the end of the film, where McClane is forced to jump off the roof of the skyscraper with only a fire hose to stop his fall would have probably resulted in McClane breaking his back.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003">Underworld (2003)</a></em> the Vampires like to make entrances by jumping off buildings without so much as bending their knees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock">Hancock</a></em> shows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a> titular hero grabbing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> kid, flying him high up into the air, zooming back down, and catching him by <em>sticking his arm out</em>. Even leaving aside the deceleration, he hit someone who can shrug off bullets and is <em>harder</em> than pavement.
<ul><li> He also tosses a whale by its tail (it rhymes!) without ripping its flukes off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">Spider-Man Trilogy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Painfully obvious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em>, where Mary Jane is over water and in danger of falling; she does fall, but after about 40 feet she grabs onto a metal pipe. Her arms are not ripped out of their sockets.
<ul><li> Earlier in the movie this was averted. Spider-Man jumped after a falling Mary Jane, caught her, and shot two spider webs to stop their fall. Unlike the comics, where the spiderwebs acted like a hard rope, in the film the webbing stretched like a bungee cord, slowing the descent before rebounding them up in the air.
</li></ul></li><li> In contrast to Gwen Stacy above, Spider-Man successfully catches Aunt May with his webbing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">his second movie</a>. This movie's webbing is shown to be very elastic, but that doesn't stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax">RiffTrax</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hanging a lampshade</a>: "And her entire skeletal system was pulverized." If <em>anyone</em> was going to have a heart attack from the shock, it would be May.
</li></ul></li><li> Gwen Stacy's death from the comics gets its revisit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderman2">The Amazing Spiderman 2</a></em>. What kills her this time isn't Spidey jerking her to a stop and snapping her neck, as in the original. It's the fact that Spidey's webs stretch like bungee cords in these movies. At terminal velocity, Gwen is falling too fast for Peter's one strand of web to slow her fall enough to survive her head first contact with the ground.
</li><li> Averted in the 1978 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em> movie when Lois falls off a high building after a helicopter accident: after catching her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> visibly decelerates over several dozen feet of downward motion before proceeding upward (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">Sheldon</a> was still pissed off by it enough to create a page quote out of it, though).
<ul><li> Also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em> where Supes catches a falling plane and has to decelerate gradually while the plane falls to pieces due to the conflict of forces (even having a wing torn off because he grabs it). Then again, the wing sparÂ—which supports the plane in flightÂ—is much stronger than the thin aluminum covering the nose cone, yet Superman successfully slows the plane by pressing up against the nose. So the scene is not entirely realistic, but at least it acknowledges the need to decelerate a massive object gradually.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted and played straight in the same scene in the 1999 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em>, when the hangar bay was depressurizing due to damage from an attack. Blair plays it straight when he grabs an item on the deck to stop his being sucked out into space, without any obvious discomfort or injuries. For the subversion, Maniac's rush towards the vacuum is stopped by a cable tied around his waist and held at the other end by other pilots. The sudden stop when the cable that was tied around his midsection catches makes him visibly wince in pain, and afterwards, he's shown with bandages wrapped around his waist, where the cable bit into him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>, a skilled Na'vi falling in or over a forest can shed enough velocity on vines and leaves to survive a drop from a great height. It helps a lot that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Pandora has lower gravity and denser atmosphere than Earth</a>, and correspondingly falling bodies have lower terminal velocity, and Na'vi have much harder skeletal and organ structures than humans.
</li><li> In the French film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaHaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaHaine">La Haine</a></em>, there is a recurring motif of the man who falls from the top of a four storey building. As he falls, he repeats, "<em>Jusqu'ici, tout va bien</em>" ("So far, so good", or "Up to here, all goes well"). <em>Mais l'important n'est pas la chute...c'est l'atterrissage</em>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOtherGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOtherGuys">The Other Guys</a></em>, where the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Decoy Protagonists</a> fall about ten stories planning to be saved by landing in bushes.

When Obi-Wan falls several stories, Anakin catches up in a speeder and descends with him, matching his speed and slowing down gradually once he's on board. Not long after, Anakin flings himself out of the speeder, falls several stories himself and catches the canopy of another speeder going <em>very</em> fast. And yet he doesn't lose his arm. Not yet anyway...
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock">The Rock</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">British spy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">John Mason</a> offers to shake hands with FBI Director Womack, and slides a slipknot over the latter's wrist. He immediately pulls Womack over the railing of a hotel balcony, and the man is left dangling by the cord; both the sudden stop and the effort to pull him back up dislocate his shoulder and he has to carry his arm in a sling afterwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TheReturnOfHanuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TheReturnOfHanuman">The Return of Hanuman</a></em> has a boy surviving after crushing through walls and a guy falling off the road while driving his truck. Seems like Maruti the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">reincarnation of Hanuman</a> isn't the only one who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>.

However, he did smash through several rope bridges on the way down as well, thus decreasing his speed a little and rendering this...slightly less implausible. <em>Slightly.</em>

</li><li> In the 2009 B-movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Infestation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Infestation">Infestation</a></em>, a giant wasp grabs a guy and flies away. A policeman patiently waits until the pair are above a roof before shooting the wasp. Unfortunately, the victim lands on the roof headfirst and dies anyway. Also, a man who tries to jump from a moving truck breaks both of his legs.

Towards the end of the film, the villain falls off a tall building, hits the awning on the ground floor, then tumbles to the street, and gets up completely unharmed. He takes a few steps and is then mauled by a lion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, Bilbo and a goblin tumble over the edge of a landing in the goblin caves. Bilbo loses consciousness but survived with a few bruises and cuts and was up and running in no time thanks to a cluster of mushrooms that cushioned his fall when he should have been in a much worse condition with or without the mushrooms. The goblin had nothing to cushion its fall, leaving it easy prey for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gollum</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackTheGiantSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackTheGiantSlayer">Jack the Giant Slayer</a></em> when Jack and Isabelle are on the falling beanstalk; they swing on a smaller vine to convert their downward momentum to horizontal momentum and slide along the ground.

Norville then just hangs there for several minutes while talking to an angel (it's that kind of movie) until the clock-cleaner restarts time and Norville falls the few remaining feet - and, presumably since he already safely decelerated when time was stopped, he's only very slightly injured</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em>, Marcus Wright survives falling off of an HK-Carrier flying quickly enough to make him skip across the Rio Grande when he falls off. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Justified because he's actually a machine built by Skynet with organic parts, though he doesn't know this at first and still has organic parts that should have been pulverized by this.</span>

<ul><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool">Sideways Stories From Wayside School</a></em>. A girl fell asleep in class, rolled out the window, and fell. The playground supervisor catches her before hitting the ground. The school is a 30-floor building, with her class on the top floor. The student in question is...annoyed at being woken up from her nap. (Then again, this is also a school where a teacher had the power to change children into apples and dead rats occasionally try to sneak into classrooms, so it may be safe to say that the rules of the real world don't always apply.)
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewReilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewReilly">Area 7</a></em>, when Scarecrow does the 'Sydney Harbour Bridge' (two Maghooks connecting in midair) with Gant, thus stopping his fall. IIRC, it's described as 'one hell of a jolt' and it hurts him a lot.
<ul><li> This trope (and the stock phase) is the syllabus of <em>The Five Greatest Warriors</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack's falling into a bottomless pit, and stops his fall with a Maghook.

The bird and Arthur have an argument about getting safely down to the ground below, which ends when Arthur apologizes for impinging on the birds' time and resumes his fall. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The bird is sufficiently guilt-tripped to dive after Arthur and rescue him by grabbing him by the shoulders, resulting in both a second example of this trope and of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableTerminalVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableTerminalVelocity">Variable Terminal Velocity</a> as the bird should not have been able to catch up, and if he could he would have torn Arthur asunder in his attempt to arrest his fall</span>.
<ul><li> The fall is from an enormous sculpture, specifically from a part which is able to float impossibly many miles in the air, just because it's 'artistically correct'. Presumably, Arthur survives the fall and the argument with the bird for the same reason.
</li><li> In the same arc Marvin falls from the same altitude and has his fall arrested by only the rocky ground below. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He survives, but did decelerate for a whole mile through the rock</span>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic">The Colour of Magic</a></em>: the narrative stops for a brief essay on the fact that catching someone who is falling at terminal velocity would definitely kill them, but in this case, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">not a problem</a>.
</li><li> Rincewind abides by a variation of the trope. He claims he is not afraid of heights but of <em>grounds</em>: rightly recognizing that the ground is the actual instrument of death in a fatal fall. Also, his own life experience (and the fact that he's a just-barely-Wizard) show him multiple times that he can survive falls...provided someone or something intervenes on his behalf.
</li><li> Discworld gnomes are six inches tall, but with the strength and toughness of a six-foot-tall man. Their lesser mass means that they can casually jump off the roof of a two-story building and land safely without splattering.
</li><li> The Nac Mac Feegle use birds as transportation and "land" by simply jumping off them from height. Like the gnomes, they're small and very strong and tough and their biggest problem is they are embarrassed by having to dig themselves out of the ground. They later start using a pair of stolen "bigjob" underwear as a parachute.

Justified in that his father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Poseidon</a>, the god of the sea.

</li><li> In the last of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> books, Kim Kinnison's daughter Constance is described as having formed a close friendship with Worsel, the flying dragon Lensman, to the point where she <em>rides him like a horse</em> (and has done so since she was big enough to climb on). One of her sisters describes how he "pretty nearly split her in two with an eleven-gee pull-up", for which she kicked him.
<ul><li> For the record, E. E. Smith was pretty careful about the application of physics because one of the key sci-fi elements in the series was neutralizing inertia (which is critical to this trope). The basic idea is that, under the neutralizing field, the object's original or "intrinsic" velocity, is still there but neutralized until the field shuts off, upon which the object immediately resumes its original velocity. Basically, the trope applied while you were in the field, but the trope also could be gruesomely averted unless you were careful before turning it off (the risks were noted frequently). Only one exception was ever made (an important but very small object), and that was handled by one of the most elaborate shock-absorbing contrivances ever written.

This is one of the show's rare cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, since this is exactly what would happen if someone were sucked out of the plane at high altitude, and in fact actually happened to a stewardess aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243 in April 1988. Flight 243 was an old Boeing 737, built in the '60s, that had endured tens of thousands of pressurization cycles and operated in the warm salt air over the Pacific Ocean. The fuselage skin started to crack just behind the cockpit bulkhead due to corrosion and metal fatigue. Finally, while cruising at 24,000 feet, nearly a third of the roof peeled off, sucking a stewardess out of the plane. What saved the plane and the passengers (who were buckled into their seats) is that, unlike the 1981 crash of a Boeing 737 owned by Far Eastern Air Transport, the floor stayed intact. (In the 1981 crash, both the ceiling AND the floor ripped off, dooming the plane and the passengers.)

(Too bad our heroes must still contend with the Changeling leading them; their natural form is liquid so going "squish" doesn't hurt them.) However, outside impacts can't be predicted so the inertial dampers take a moment to compensate for the unexpected change in motion, hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake">Star Trek Shake</a> that would still be <em>much worse</em> without them.

<ul><li> At least three editions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Hero System</a> rules have used some variant of the following line to open the rules on falling damage:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"> Falling itself does no damage whatsoever to a character â€” but the impact with the ground can be mighty painful.
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> Given its roots in the superhero genre, it's not surprising that Hero does allow a character who catches another to apply his or her strength to reduce the damage taken by <em>both</em>, potentially all the way down to zero. (Of course, by the 6th edition game rules terminal velocity on Earth still translates to 30d6 â€” yes, that's thirty dice â€” of "normal" damage, which would require an unheard-of STR of 150 to negate completely.) The game even covers the angle of falling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">desolidified</a> characters, who basically have the choice of either taking falling damage normally or else keeping on falling <em>through</em> the ground...which may well be worse if they have no other way to stop and no appropriate life support.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, Perfect Defenses allow you to take no damage from anything, falling damage included. This makes sense for the ones that turn your skin to iron or even allow you to block attacks but how in Creation do you dodge the ground? It's not by "throwing yourself at the ground and missing", because Arthur Dent already tried that.
<ul><li> You can't dodge or parry the ground, even with a perfect defense â€” they work only against any <em>attack</em>, and falling hard is not an attack. This is clarified in a sidebar in <em>Infernals</em>. The few exceptions are justified (like a perfect parry that turns your skin to magic invulnerable brass, and a perfect dodge that dodges the <em>fate</em> of whatever was going to happen to you.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Ninjas &amp; Superspies</em> had two martial arts powers that allowed a character to survive extremely long falls with minimal damage.

<ul><li> Any high-level character can survive. You suffer 1d6 damage per 10 feet<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07c14');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07c14" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07c14');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to <em>Dragon</em> magazine #70, page 13, this was a printing error; the damage was supposed to be cumulative, with a 10 foot fall doing 1d6, a 20 foot fall doing 1d6+2d6, a 30 foot fall doing 1d6+2d6+3d6, etc.</span> up to 20d6 damage, or generally between 60 and 80 points. You also have to roll versus death from massive damage (if you're using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">that rule</a>) but anyone capable of surviving the damage will make the save. By the time you're high level, you probably have other means of surviving a fall anyway.
</li><li> The monk makes their fall slower by scraping against the wall or another method of deceleration, they still take normal damage if there's nothing nearby.
</li><li> This rule was abused in the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIntercontinentalUnionOfDisgustingCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIntercontinentalUnionOfDisgustingCharacters">The Intercontinental Union of Disgusting Characters</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aion">Aion</a></em>, even though you can fall from ridiculous heights, hitting the ground kills you instantly (from more than something like 10m or so). You can spread your wings just above the ground to save yourself though, but that's not necessarily that unrealistic (apart from the spreading your wings part :) ) - you only accelerate for a while, after that the air resistance counteracts the pull of gravity and after you spread the wings, you don't just stop immediately - you glide a bit, giving you much more time to dissipate the speed than simply splatting into the ground. Also, the world Aion is set in appears to have very strange gravitational properties (mainly to the Aether, which apparently acts as a kind of antigravitational <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> and also thanks to the fact, that the planet is eaten from inside, thus having much smaller gravity... everyone moves like on Earth more or less though... Aether did it?)
<ul><li> In newer versions, Aion will actually kill you simply from falling. It takes somewhere between 5 to 10 seconds of unrestricted free-falling to instantly kill you without waiting for you to hit any surface whatsoever. Particularly noticeable if you try to free-fall from the upper abyss to the lower, and catch yourself near the end of the fall. This was probably implemented to counter the common abuse which allowed you to save quite a few seconds of flight time by doing this trick. Between Abyss levels this almost the same behaviour as before.

This carried over into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> attempted to justify this by means of Batman's glider cape: if he is falling towards the ground, the cape will automatically open a few feet before the ground, slowing his descent somewhat. However, it's played completely straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">sequel</a>, in which Batman gains a new move which allows him to dive vertically (without his cape opening) and still hit the ground unharmed. Additionally, Catwoman is able to jump huge vertical distances and not take any damage when hitting the ground (it's occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> by having her perform a combat roll when landing). Finally, in both games it's played straight in another instance, as Batman and Catwoman are able to throw mooks off of very tall buildings, but when their bodies are scanned after the fact they are invariably described as "Unconscious", even if the falls are long enough to realistically kill even a very strong person.
<ul><li> Partial "justification" for Batman's vertical dive bomb attack in Arkham City: the move utilizes the same comic book technology involved in the cape, the utility belt, the helmet, and pretty much every square inch of the suit, to store up the kinetic energy of the impact to release in an area of effect. The Batsuit in the games is not so much the classic "skintight silk costume" as "powered armor with a bat motif."
</li></ul></li><li> Painfully inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield 1942</a></em>. Fall damage is calculated by judging the distance in your starting height and your end height. The damage scales horribly, and is even applied to vehicles. Walking down a hill too fast and fall 3 inches? Half your HP is gone. Drive a little too fast over a bump in the road and get the front of your tank just barely off the ground? It's probably going to explode and kill you as it "lands".
<ul><li> This also has an interesting effect when combined with the parachute. Some attacks (grenades, tank shells, aircraft splash damage, etc) blow you up into the air if they don't kill you outright. If you hit your parachute (or land on something even slightly higher than the ground you started from) you'll live. The parachute will nullify all fall damage regardless of how long it has been deployed, with the caveat that you can only deploy it once you've already fallen further than your starting height, making it tricky to deploy in time (due to reflexes and lag) if you're being abused by shoddy map geometry.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> the player can jump from one skyline to another with the sky-hook, and even if he falls a hundred feet from the air as long as he can latch on a skyline with his sky-hook he's ok. If it were real the fall would have dislodged his arm from his socket, or should have broken the sky-hook from all that force.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> featured minor fall damage that fit this trope, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> removed fall damage altogether. In fact, at one point, one of the characters tells you that while you're standing on an easily 200 foot skyscraper to jump off, if you do so he remarks how badass you are. Of course the player will do so because there's absolutely no punishment to doing it other than being praised for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bug">Bug</a></em> You only die if you fell off the terrain itself (each level is a huge floating 3D terrain). As long as Bug lands on a platform, he'll be safe.
</li><li> Riddick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheChroniclesOfRiddick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheChroniclesOfRiddick">The Chronicles of Riddick</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromButcherBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromButcherBay">Escape from Butcher Bay</a></em> survives a massive fall by grabbing a guard with him and holding him in front of him, which resulted in the guard hitting the ground first and taking the impact, leaving our favourite anti-hero unscathed. Badass as this may be, it landed him in a dark, underground subterranean level of the prison filled with nasty aliens with a dwindling flashlight and not much ammo. Bonus points for actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">mentioning this trope</a>, word for word.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown">Crackdown</a></em>: arresting a long fall by grabbing onto a ledge still hurts just as much as it would normally, but in spite of the sickening "crunch" sound implying that the agent has just broken his arms, he doesn't let go of the ledge. Using the agent's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">stomp</a> ability doesn't prevent damage, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">falling into water does.</a>
</li><li> Averted in the latter two of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Creatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Creatures">Creatures</a></em> trilogy, in which you can injure Norns by picking them up and throwing them against walls. However, provided a fall is enough to injure the Norn at all, it injures them just as badly no matter how far they fall. (Although this is partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>.)
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em>. If you mod your speed mode (by altering the difficulty level text files - the hardest of which is suffixed with "_bauer", amusingly) to go far faster than normal, manage to run up to full speed and smack into a wall or other object of scenery (train car, solid gate, whatever) it is quite possible to do some serious harm to yourself, and possibly even kill yourself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CubeWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CubeWorld">Cube World</a></em> plays it straight and averts it at the same time. Naturally, falling off from a high ledge makes you take damage from the fall and it's possible to bounce down a steep slope and take damage from each falling bounce. Hang gliders slow your ascent, but if you run out of stamina, your character spirals in circles before going down and crashing into the ground; crashing this way only leaves you dazed and you don't suffer a scratch at all!
</li><li> Played with oddly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>. It IS the fall that kills you. Fall damage is calculated based on time in the air and is applied when you hit the ground; if you get yourself in an animation loop of infinitely falling, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLFDVOs0kcw">you'll still die eventually.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Even items that completely negate fall damage don't apply to some specific drops.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em>, Frank West takes roughly normal (in video game terms) falling damage, unless he does a knee drop. That's right, landing on your feet hurts, but directing all the force <em>into your kneecap</em> is a perfect solution.
</li><li> Played straight initially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> with the optional addition of an augmentation that allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Jensen</a> to fall from any height and survive. The game always shows Jensen activating something that shoots lightning downwards that, apparently, creates a cushion for a soft landing. Interestingly, this neither consumes nor requires energy.
<ul><li> That would be the appropriately-named Icarus Landing System. It is described with the following technobabble: "A discreet augmentation surgically implanted in the user's lower back, slightly above the coccyx at the base of the vertebral column. The device has an acceleration descent sensor built in; in free fall, the unit will automatically activate the patented High-Fall Safeguard System, an EMF decelerator generating a fixed-focus electromagnetic lensing field, projected downward along the plane of the drop. This field pushes against the Earth's magnetosphere and slows the user's descent to a manageable velocity, allowing him to fall from almost any height (within reason) to a relatively soft landing."
</li><li> A lesser example occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">the original</a>. JC can obtain a leg augmentation which reduces (but doesn't completely negate) fall damage. When sufficiently upgraded, this enables a particularly notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">Dungeon Bypass</a> in which he jumps from the roof of a building rather than having to fight through several floors of Mooks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening">Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Lady</a> is thrown off the side of the Temen-ni-Gru by Arkham. She falls for at least 8 seconds before Dante catches her. <em>By her ankle.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Lady takes worse later on.</a>
<ul><li> While it hasn't been explicitly stated, it seems that Dante and Vergil - and, by extension, Nero from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">the fourth game</a> - are just immune to falling harm. Both of them just jump from the freaking top of the Temen-ni-Gru tower to get down. They do have some combination of an immense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, though - Lady actually shoots Dante straight in the forehead after he catches her and he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorInjuryUnderreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorInjuryUnderreaction">merely annoyed a little bit</a>, to say nothing of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">tendency</a> to get impaled by his own sword and act like nothing happened.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em>: One of your powers, Blink, allows you to teleport within a short distance of anything you have line-of-sight to... but sends you to the endpoint with your initial velocity; therefore, if you manage to teleport to a higher ledge or balcony while falling at a fatal velocity (a velocity at which hitting the ground will kill you), Newton's first law applies that since your position was changed without major change to your current velocity, you are now falling at fatal velocity onto a ledge/balcony. Then you die.
<ul><li> Played straight, however, with drop assassinations. In the game, you can break your fall from any hight if you fall on top of an enemy while attacking with your sword. This will trigger a special animation that will kill them and land you safely on the ground. Turned up to 11 if you drop assassinate the armored enemies on stilts known as Tall Boys, because the animation shows your character stopping himself easily with one arm by grabbing the Tall Boy's chestplate, even if he fell from a height where this would dislocate his shoulder or worse.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</a></em>, true to its tabletop roots, allows high-level monks to fall very long distances without taking damage. There are feather fall items that allow any character to drift slowly downward and take no damage, but monks take no damage despite falling at full speed. There's one instance where monks are well advised to have a feather fall item anyway: not because they'll take damage from hitting the ground, but because otherwise they'll be <em>alone in combat</em> at the bottom of the shaft for a minute or so while the rest of the party is wafting lazily downward. If you know it's coming, you can try to land on a ledge a little above the bottom and wait for the rest of the party, but if you miss that you're in trouble.
</li><li> Played rather strangely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>. Normally averted, as fall damage is definitely in play and can even be weaponized by judicious use of a certain shout. The odd part comes when an enemy falls just a short distance but then slides down a slope for a while before coming to a stop. The damage appears to be calculated as if it were falling the whole time.
<ul><li> Also, if you fall while riding a horse, the horse takes the entire impact. So you can fall off a mountain and walk away unscathed from the crumpled corpse of your former mount.
</li><li> In a bizarre interaction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a>, very long falls, even those that involve you bouncing off the side of a mountain or skidding along the mountainside on your face on the way down will be survivable <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/Im5IpE2rleo?t=44s">so long as you land in sufficiently deep water at the bottom.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Everquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Everquest">Everquest</a></em> keeps similar physics to <em>World of Warcraft</em>: falling any significant depth will damage or kill you, with the damage being proportionate to the fall. A fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">any body of water</a> (no matter now long the fall or how deep the water) will result in no damage.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> (both use the same engine). Falling from a too large height will damage you, and once you've passed the damaging height limit, you don't need to go much higher to kill yourself. There's also a cheat that increases the size of your character model... but it doesn't scale physics interactions with it. So it is entirely possible to turn yourself into a giant, but still die from what is now a knee-height fall. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Landing in water</a>, though, cancels fall damage... assuming you fall deep enough. You need about 3 feet of water below you to break the fall, otherwise you'll take full damage and die, only with your corpse floating in the water.
<ul><li> Using the GECK editor, it is possible to develop ways to cheat and alter a character's movement speed. This has the potentially dangerous side effect of causing damage by hurling yourself into various obstacles or pieces of debris strewn about the Wasteland.
</li><li> Also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> if you're wearing Power Armor. No fall damage is sustained after falling from any height, and if you fall from high enough that you would normally take fall damage, you land with a massive thud that inflicts damage on anyone nearby, including friendly NPCs.
</li><li> Averted in <em>Pegasus Prime</em>, with such labels as "Face Plant" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">"Have a Nice Fall"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> has a cutscene where Yuna comes up with a plan to escape <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her wedding to Seymour</span>, settling on jumping off the roof of the building, and summoning Valefor as she falls, landing on her just a relatively short distance from the ground. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">As awesome as that is</a>, Yuna would still have died upon landing on Valefor (not even mentioning that she was going head-first when she fell).
</li><li> In cutscenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, Lightning utilizes a device called a Grav-Con unit to survive incredible falls and jumps (it reverses gravity just before the character hits the ground).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has players suffering fall damage if they jump off a cliff that is too high. However, you can't die from fall damage, only be reduced to 1 HP... as long as you're not currently in battle. If you are, you <em>will</em> die from falling too far. The game also ignores <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a> by treating deep pools of water as solid ground if you fall into it from a great height. Fall damage inside dungeons is completely ignored for the sake of convenience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has characters take fall damage if they fall a greater distance than their jump rating (4 for most classes), at a rate of 10% of Max HP per height level. A fall of 10 or more over the character's jump rating is always fatal. Given the scale of the game, this isn't actually all that high (roughly ten yards).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod">Garry's Mod</a></em> is even worse than the above <em>Half-Life 2</em> in this regard - no matter how far you fall, unless you have some addon that <em>makes</em> falls more realistically painful, at most you will suffer <em>ten damage</em> (which, by the way, can be easily and immediately regained by spawning and using a pair of one of the default entities that comes with Garry's Mod). As stated, there are some add-ons that make this more realistic, like the "Perfected Climb SWEP". Given the nature of Garry's Mod, however, the default behavior is likely a safety to help keep you from hurting yourself while world-building. The fact that realistic damage add-ons exist and can be activated means the choice (as in most things in Garry's Mod) is up to the world-builder.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> game, the opening cut scene has our heroine leaping out of a helicopter flying high above and landing without trouble, possibly justified by her cyborg nature. And then in the rest of the gameplay, you die if you fall off an eight-foot-high stack of crates. Base jumping without any apparent equipment is the Major's calling card, and it's never shown how she lands after these jumps.
</li><li> Justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GloryOfHeracles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GloryOfHeracles">Glory of Heracles</a></em> series, in which your characters are immortals who can jump off high cliffs without even taking damage. If you have any mortals in your party, you won't be able to jump off cliffs until they're gone.
</li><li> Kratos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em>, being a demi-god, is rather good at surviving falls, unless it's into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pit</a> of some kind.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">the second game</a>, he performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffHanger">Literal Cliff Hanger</a> with his chainblades after leaping off the back of a Griffin.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII">the third</a>, he leaps from the Labyrinth inside Mount Olympus all the way into the Underworld.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> game, Sheba falls off the top of Venus Lighthouse, and Felix leaps off the tower after her, in an apparent suicide dive. It's later noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">the seas miraculously rose up to the tower as they fell</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> of that game and beginning of the next shows that they washed up on a beach later, unconscious but otherwise unharmed.
<ul><li> In the second game, it's confirmed that Sheba is a Wind Adept, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Kraden</a> suggests that she subconsciously used her powers to slow the fall, rather than breaking it. Whirlwinds carrying water is how water spouts are formed, so Sheba's powers also explain the "seas rising up" part. (Felix also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">incredulously checks himself for injuries</a> upon waking.)
</li><li> The massive crater next to Lalivero in the first game? Sheba fell from the sky (possibly from the moon) as an infant. Somehow she hit hard enough to leave <em>a crater the size of a city</em>, but was completely unhurt herself.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series <em>does</em> have falling damage, but if the player character can catch hold of a ladder (or rope, in <em>Opposing Force</em>) on the way down, all that momentum dissipates like magic. Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a> is in full effect, such that a few <em>inches</em> of water that can't even noticeably impact your movement on the ground will still cancel all downward momentum.
<ul><li> Interestingly, in <em>Half Life 1's</em> engine, it <em>is</em> the fall that kills you. The game essentially runs a timer whenever your feet leave the ground, and if you are off the ground for too long, when you land you die. So if you accidentally get stuck on an object and are barely floating above the ground, you will still die as soon as you reconnect with the ground despite barely being any distance up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>: Inverted in most gameplay situations, where you automatically die in midair after falling about 30 feet. This was also hilariously averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> beta; if you turned up the movement speed as high as it could go, players could die by simply running into each other fast enough.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS">inFAMOUS</a></em>, Cole can leap off the tallest building in the game, and suffer no damage at all. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Unless</a></em> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">falls into water.</a> Also, anything he lands on (unless he's using the Thunder Drop) will also be perfectly fine. Turns out he uses his Kinetic Shockwave to dampen his fall (notice the dust spreading from his impact point).
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightDarkForcesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightDarkForcesII">Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</a></em>, which incorporated a collision damage system where any abrupt impact from <em>any</em> direction will hurt the same way. Force Jump and you'll take damage appropriately should there be a low ceiling in your way. Force Speed and run into a wall and you'll also take damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetSetRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetSetRadio">Jet Set Radio</a> Future</em>, as long as you land within the level (i.e. you don't fall from a skyscraper, which deducts a few HP and sends you back to your nearest checkpoint) even ridiculously long falls cause no damage as long as you hit a grind rail or continually strike poses on your way down.
</li><li> Stated word-for-word in a "glitch-death" encountered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a> Turbo</em> that's triggered if you try to move forward or backward on a vertical ore conveyor on Mars, implying that you fell out of one of the buckets you were standing in, and landed at the bottom of the shaft.
</li><li> Partially averted and partially played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2">Just Cause 2</a></em>. The aversion: free-falling from great heights will injure or kill Rico, whether the fall is onto land or water. There are no ledges to grab onto, either. However, Rico's wrist-mounted grappling hook is essentially this trope's purest interactive representation. Need to pull yourself 50 meters up the side of a building in 2 seconds? Done! Need to make that same trip in reverse? No problem! And <em>the piece de resistance:</em> fly a plane 10,000 feet in the air, jump out, wait until you're about 30 feet from the ground, then fire the hook. It will <em>attach to the ground and reel you in</em> for no damage. So hitting the ground at terminal velocity will kill Rico. Using the grappling hook to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitTheGroundHarder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitTheGroundHarder">pull him to the ground even faster</a></em> allows him to survive.
<ul><li> Also, even if falling from terminal velocity, wait to deploy your parachute at the last possible second and see what happens. That's right! All that will happen is that Rico falls down, says something along the lines of "sheesh" or "Whoa... To close for comfort." and have absolutely no damage.
</li><li> Worse than all of the above examples is you can bail out of a flaming out of control jet and come out about a foot off the ground and land because you were so close to the ground that the game never has you freefalling and the speed is negated when you jump out of the jet so you're perfectly fine.
</li><li> The above about freefalling is especially silly in that Rico can, even without the hook or the parachute, fall much further than most other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> protagonists can without taking damage. Jumping off from the top of a water tower (typically after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball">dropping a grenade on it</a> first) without injury is just the start.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> players that get knocked off a ledge will go into a "perilously clinging" state where they must be rescued by another player. If no one pulls them up after a certain amount of time, they fall and the game registers them as dead.
<ul><li> Naturally, falling off anything from a great height will kill survivors, but there is one minor exception. In the 2nd map of Dead Air where you activate the crane, if you look in the street below, there is a truck. If you jump off the roof and land on the truck, you'll be incapped instead of killed, but the game quickly eats away your health and kills you in just two seconds, since there's no way for your teammates to get down there and rescue you.
</li><li> Also, landing on a zombie's head will break your fall no matter how far you had fallen. If you do this in an area where you are not supposed to be like in the example above, you die anyway.
</li><li> And when a survivor is hanging from a ledge, any AI-controlled survivors (who do tend to accidentally walk off ledges) will rush to help him/her up. Problem is, before a patch changed the AI from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI">spiteful</a>, they would choose the most direct route possible. So if the survivor in peril <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqyNS7ZdY1A">was hanging on the other side of a short gap... <img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Occasionally, in a strange <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>, a survivor <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4smWSdcNBzI">will cling to an edge when the ground below them would be non-lethal, or simply not a fall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. If you let the survivor lose their grip, they will die instantly, no matter how stupid it looks. This is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>, particularly some custom maps, where the game will first drop you, <em>then</em> check if the fall killed you.
</li></ul></li><li> Early subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfTheWizard">Legacy of the Wizard</a></em>. If you fall from higher than the character's maximum jump height, it's gonna hurt. Not a total aversion, because the damage is the same no matter how high you fall from.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro">The Legend of Spyro</a></em>:
<ul><li> No matter how far Spyro falls, even if it's from the highest point in a level to the lowest point, he'll simply hit the ground in a tiny puff of dust, and immediately keep on walking on legs that are miraculously not turned to mush. In A Hero's Tail and the Legend of Spyro trilogy, he'll start to scream in terror if he falls too far, but he's still always fine when he hits the ground.
</li><li> In <em>The Eternal Night,</em> you do take slight but noticeable falling damage, which can be negated by gliding for at least the last foot or so of the fall. There are few things more embarrassing than beating a mini-boss or ambush <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">with one HP left</a></em> then dying on the next jump because you misjudged the height...

In later games, if you fall <em>too</em> far, the roll move will no longer save you from damage.
</li><li> Zig-Zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>. At face value, it's played more realistically than every other game; whereas fall damage in those would take out 3 hearts at worst, it can scale all the way up to 30 hearts here, enough to instantly kill you at any point. However, you also get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight">Paraglider</a> at the end of the tutorial, which brings any fall to an immediate midair stop without any consequences.

Falling from a small height will at least get you injured and limping for up to a minute. Falling even further or far enough to take damage while the injury debuff is active will kill you instantly, however.
</li><li> At the end of the manor house level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorFrontline">Medal of Honor: Frontline</a></em>, you and Geritt escape by jumping off a several story high balcony into a hay wagon.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Snake Eater</a></em>, you may even have to medically treat your broken shins. Subverted with ledge-grabbing, however; as long as your arms stop the fall, you're fine.
</li><li> Zig-Zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV">Metal Gear Solid V</a></em>; there's still "pain" and "death" falls for Snake, but enemies who fall off of ledges can crack their skulls and die at much shorter heights than would even make him grunt. Riding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot">D-Walker</a> also completely negates any fall damage Snake would take.
</li></ul></li><li> Remarkably averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheRedStringsClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheRedStringsClub">The Red Strings Club</a></em>: neither the fall from a mega-skyscraper <em>nor</em> the landing kill Brandeis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IFellForHours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IFellForHours">The fall is so long</a> that he bleeds out from his gunshot wounds before he hits the pavement.</span>
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> games lack fall acceleration and thus lack fall damage, even from literal canyons, unless Samus falls to the ground with something heavy on top of her. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em> has the opposite, where flying too high without the spacecraft will cause Samus to take damage and fall back down(every game stops you in a similar manner but most do not punish the player with damage for it). The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> games do have fall acceleration and if you somehow manage to get Samus into a situation where she reaches terminal velocity she will freeze up and the player will be unable to take any action until she hits the ground, at which point she will be temporarily stunned. Samus still takes no fall damage from this, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a>, which do cause minor damage to Samus before she respawns next to them. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidPrimeHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidPrimeHunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a></em> is the only game where regular falls can hurt Samus if she is high enough and free fall,will kill you if Samus misses a jump in a low gravity, no atmosphere enviornment and drifts out into space. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> goes back to having no adverse affects for falls, provided Samus simply falls. If she is <em>thrown</em> towards the ground she can then she can be injured.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> falling into water will prevent any fall damage. The same applies when catching a ladder.
<ul><li> This actually plays into several useful constructs, most notably the Water BrakeÂ™. Don't want to climb all the way down your mineshaft? Just toss a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingIsland">water block on top of a sign</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">and you need not worry about long climbs ever again!</a>
</li><li> The death message reminds you that you didn't die from falling, you just hit the ground too hard.
</li><li> Also shows up inverted if you have flying enabled but are not in creative mode. If you try to fly after a long freefall, you can "hit the ground too hard" in midair.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> on the rooftops of a futuristic city. It completely averts this trope and you have to take a roll to dampen the impact of jumps from considerable heights. If you miss a jump between buildings, there's really not much more you can do than bracing yourself for the sickening sound of a body hitting the sidewalk.
<ul><li> Played straight, however, in a cutscene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kate falls out of a helicopter</span>: She somehow manages not only to grab and hold onto the ledge of a building <em>with her arms alone</em> (because she's <em>handcuffed</em>), she isn't even remotely hurt by doing so (or, for that matter, by hitting a building from that distance in the first place).
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>. Falling off a large height will cause you to "stick" your landing, forcing you to be still for a few seconds, and if you were in transport mode, whatever you were carrying will be destroyed unless you have a skill that negates the effect (e.g. Felyne Lander). However, you can never take damage from a fall, even if it was off a volcanic peak that <em>has</em> to be at least 100 meters high. Then again, it probably makes sense, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Hunters can also withstand inhuman amounts of abuse from monsters without so much as a finger broken</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MurderedSoulSuspect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MurderedSoulSuspect">Murdered: Soul Suspect</a></em> plays with this trope. Ronan gets thrown out of a fourth-story window and lands on the street outside but survives â€” just barely. The impact caused enough damage for his soul to separate from his body. His actual death is caused by the Bell Killer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">shooting him in the chest seven times</a> upon noticing that Ronan was still alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle">No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</a></em> has a completely insane example in the ending. After finishing off the final boss, Travis plummets several hundred feet to the pavement, and Sylvia catches him...out of the air with one hand, while he's an <em>inch</em> from hitting the pavement, and slings him onto the back of her motorcycle.
<ul><li> Given how the series plays with reality, it's perfectly within standards, but admittedly if one doesn't suspend their disbelief soon enough, most of the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">questionably survivable but visually awesome</a>.
<ul><li> It is justified, in that Travis doesn't take any damage from attacks where the player has no input during. Yes, this is the actual reason for it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>, after a boss fight in the sky, Gwendolyn laments her impending death and converses with the spirit of her dead sister. This goes on for several minutes and another cutscene plays in the middle of it. After falling long enough for a bathroom break, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her lover, Oswald, saves her by making a quick jump from somewhere below and catching her</span>.
</li><li> Played mostly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em>. There is no fall damage, but it follows the usual convention that falling (or being pushed) off the map causes instant death. However, there are also special areas within some maps that have the same insta-kill effect, such as the well in the center of the control point of one <a class="urllink" href="http://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Ilios">Ilios<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> map. These can be used tactically, as certain weapons have the ability to push or pull you into these deathtraps deliberately. (Do <em>not</em> stand across the well from an enemy <a class="urllink" href="http://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Roadhog">Roadhog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
<ul><li> Quick reflexes, the right hero, and a bit of luck may save you even then: if charged, a rocket boost or grappling hook may be able to pull you out in time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em> captains never reach a damaging, much less lethal terminal velocity from falling, even if they literally fall from the upper atmosphere onto rocks! However, like <em>Metroid</em>, they can be damaged if they are <em>thrown</em> into the ground or fall with something "heavy" on top of them. And given Pikmin captains are the size of coins, the threshold for "heavy" is much higher.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> lacks fall damage, but justifies it by putting spring mechanisms on Chell's heels that absorb the force of impact. The game's own developer commentary discusses this â€” Chell was given leg springs because playtesters complained about her surviving "falls that would kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Gordon Freeman</a>."
<ul><li> <em>Portal</em> is notable in that its unique conservation of momentum allows terminal velocity to be reached over short distances and vertical acceleration can quickly become horizontal. Yet you always land on your feet, completely upright. And if you construct your portals a certain way (both on the floor but "aligned" improperly) and bounce between them over and over, you can quickly get turned upside-down, though Chell is always capable of righting herself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">There is a theory that she is righted by gyroscopes in the springs.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX9Sc88qreg">The final promo for the sequel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows that Chell now has special boots instead of just the springs. The narrator Cave Johnson claims they prevent her from landing anywhere except on her feet (there is no evidence to support this, as all of Chell's flips are of her own accord). This is <em>not</em> mentioned in the game proper (although it is commented on by GLaDOS) and early in the game, Wheatley still sounds concerned about Chell jumping into a large pit and landing on, say, her head. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The bit about Wheatley is justified in that he is <em>designed</em> to be a moron.</span>
</li><li> <em>Portal 2</em> also features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia">Prince of Persia</a> 2: The Shadow and The Flame</em>, attempting to grab a ledge after you've fallen beyond the ordinarily lethal limit, will leave you crushed on the floor... while your arms dangle from the ledge above.
<ul><li> And in the original, the grab action would simply fail to stop a lethal fall, except in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">those ports where it didn't</a>, allowing some major unintended shortcuts.
</li><li> In the <em>Sands of Time</em> games almost any fall will kill you, even ones that would only cause discomfort. Justified in that given the environments he's in, even a broken ankle or sprain would effectively kill him. In the same game, if you fall from a great height but manage to get near a ledge just before hitting the floor, the prince will grab onto the ledge - completely decelerating in a fraction of a second - before losing his grip and falling to the floor. Decelerating from terminal velocity using only his fingertips doesn't harm him, but the short drop to the floor below kills him outright.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> features no fall damage whatsoever; in fact there is an attack that is based on jumping as high as possible, then dropping down like a bullet and creating a MASSIVE shockwave that can even seriously damage tanks. This is justified as the protagonist has no bones to break or organs to rupture. Justified even further since he can absorb the mass of anything he devours, thus if he ate 60 people, he is extremely dense and now has the weight of 60 people in a centralized human-shaped body. 60 people x Average 100-200 weight (assuming) = Extremely hard weight slamming the ground at incredible speeds. So in <em>Prototype</em>'s case, it's not Alex's fall that kills you, it's the resulting shock wave from the blow.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuantumConundrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuantumConundrum">Quantum Conundrum</a></em>, you'll survive any fall as long as you shift to the Fluffy dimension, giving you a plush cotton floor to land on. Though even in normal dimensions, you seem pretty resistant to fall damage for a child.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2002)</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ratchet and Clank wind up falling from the platform where they fight and defeat Chairman Drek. Ratchet even looks down and you can't see the ground from how high up they are. And yet, Clank, changing to his Thruster Pack mode, and propelling himself against Ratchet seconds before hitting the ground is enough for the pair to just skid against the ground a bit. The only injury sustained by either of them is Clank's broken servos in his arm, which were from the force of holding up Ratchet's weight BEFORE they fell</span>.
</li><li> Hilariously averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> during the Pueblo attack, due to Leon's habit of jumping down ladders rather than climbing them. If you climb up into the 50 foot high watchtower, Leon will still jump down, fall at a steady speed for a good three seconds, and land without so much as a grunt. It's worth pointing out that Leon isn't nearly so invulnerable to falling during any of the game's obnoxious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">Press X to Not Die</a> cutscenes.
<ul><li> Ashley is a similar case, always jumping after Leon with him catching her at the last moment. Amusingly enough, using the second alternative costume (A heavy suit of armor), Leon clutches his side in pain after breaking her fall each time.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune">Rune</a></em>, one multiplayer death message states death by deceleration trauma.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> has semi-realistic fall damage. Jumping off a ledge that is 10 feet above the ground will do some serious damage to your character. Using a parachute to avoid the fall also isn't a sure-fire way to take no damage, depending on how well you control it. However, the trope is played straight to increasing degrees as you start buying upgrades that reduce damage from falling. The final of these upgrades makes it where you are completely immune to any fall damage. You can jump off a skyscraper and face plant into the sidewalk without a single scratch on you.
<ul><li> Cutscenes however, ignore this due to rule of cool. In one part of the game The Boss Survives falling from a cargo plane simply because he was <em>inside a tank</em>.
</li><li> Its predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> also had realistic fall/physics damage â€” until you completed the BASE jumping minigame, after which you could leap off a skyscraper with no ill effect.* In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>, Wander can successfully break any fall if he grabs onto something before hitting the ground. This is particularly amusing to witness during the battle with the last colossus, where Wander can plummet <em>several stories</em> and still emerged unharmed as long as he catches a ledge on his way down. Up to a certain height, hitting the ground will only do damage, and not an enormous amount. Once you pass that height, you die on impact, even if a slightly shorter fall would barely inconvenience Wander with a maxed life bar.* Subverted in EA's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skate">Skate</a></em>. If your character falls above a certain height without landing on a decently sized slope, he won't land the trick. This can get rather ridiculous if he looks like he should have been able to land the jump. If this is the case, your skater will stand firm for a second, but then just slump over and rag doll.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> might be the largest offender of this trope since his ability has always been to run really really fast. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Not necessarily stop super fast.</a> (Likewise, he doesn't suffer fall damage.) The closest the games get to depicting wall crash damage is to make him flatten against the wall, fall on the ground, and promptly spring back up, Disney-style (this was to be depicted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Generations</a></em>, but cut out; it only appears in other 3D games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> (Wii/PS2); the Sonic 2 Nick Arcade Prototype has this feature fully implemented.) <br/><br/>In-game, you actually do slow down to a stop. During cutscenes, he skids to a halt. Make of that what you will. <br/><br/>In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>, a skill called "Stop on a Dime" allows Sonic to slow down quicker. <br/><br/>Also, he does fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em> quotes the trope word for word for one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">The Many Deaths of You</a> snarky comments.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em>, Captain Walker is left sliding down the side of a skyscraper. This sequence contains three major instances of this trope in quick succession:
<ul><li> On his way down the windows, Walker slams into construction equipment with full force. With the speed he had at that point, he should have at least bruised a few of his ribs if not broken them outright.
</li><li> Not long afterwards, he falls off the side of the building but manages to save himself by grabbing onto a flagpole. Although he would realistically be able to grab the flagpole at all, it would most likely result in his arms being ripped out of his sockets.
</li><li> Finally, he falls once again but he manages to save himself by wrapping a rope around himself and attaching it to the flagpole. After he falls a little more than 30 stories, the rope instantly snaps taut, just like WalkerÂ’s spine would in real life with the speed he had and the distance he fell.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunker">Spelunker</a></em>, especially the NES version. Falling by knee-height in the NES version kills you mid-air.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> game, it's possible to save yourself from a long fall by shooting off a web zip-line, which Spidey uses to sharply pull himself horizontally. It's quite possible to jump off the Empire State Building and then suddenly jerk to the side inches from the ground.* One of the patches to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2003</a></em> added falling damage when you perform a wall jump (i.e. you could no longer jump down a tower and wall-jump at the last second). As a concession, the shield gun now protects against falling damage.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> series, though a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> will negate any falling damage if it's initiated from a low enough height.
<ul><li> Subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> - falling for too long will make Mario flail around unable to do anything until his splat on the floor, but if you do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> before that, then as long as there's ground underneath, you won't take any damage. Not even if you fall until Mario begins to <em>light on fire as if it was re-entry from falling so far.</em>
</li><li> In all games following <em>Sunshine</em>, fall damage is completely removed. Unlike many examples, though, Mario still reacts if he falls from a very large height. He'll crash into the ground, and be stunned and unable to move for a second (two seconds in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>). This has the same limitations as fall damage in previous games, so bouncing off of something, grabbing a ledge, sliding on a wall, or doing any action close to the ground completely negates it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Oliver Twins' original <em>Super Robin Hood</em> implemented fall damage by having Robin gradually lose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> <em>while falling</em>. Likely this was to make damage calculations easier to code or more transparent to the player, but it's still bewildering to see that the fall is literally what's killing Robin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>'s Subspace Emissary storyline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">Lucas</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">PokÃ©mon</a> Trainer are falling from a height of several hundred feet (well above the summit of an impressive mountain). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Meta Knight</a> spots them and catches them nearly at ground level, flying them away from the mountain at a horizontal trajectory. Even more mind-boggling in that Meta Knight is smaller than either of those characters. But then, many other characters fall from immense heights and don't need saving to come out unscathed...
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> series, falling more than 10 or so feet in-game is fatal, although Logan survives falls much further than this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">in cutscenes</a>, such as jumping through the glass ceiling of the Pharcom Expo Center's entry hall, off a high bridge onto a train, and down an airshaft in the Agency Biolab to grab a vent just above a giant fan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> the Scout doesn't take any fall damage from leaping off of high places if he does a double jump before hitting the ground. The Scout later got a pistol that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">somehow</a> makes him immune to fall damage.
<ul><li> The Soldier can obtain a pair of boots that let him evade fall damage if he successfully does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> on an enemy. Any damage he would've suffered goes to the stomped enemy instead... <em>three-fold</em>.
</li><li> As other classes (or a Scout, if not double-jumping or equipped with that pistol), you take falling damage if you drop more than twice your height, approximately. If your health is low or the fall is high enough, this kills you, complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">notification for everyone to read on your clumsy, painful death</a>.
</li><li> Since this game uses the same engine as <em>Half-Life 2</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a> is also in effect. Some mapmakers invoke the trope by intentionally using this or the ladder trick at strategic places.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em> uses this in Kazuya Mishima's backstory: as a child, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> father Heihachi tossed him off a cliff to see if he could survive and climb back up. He does, but only after making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> has fall damage for its players by default, but only the player characters, and there are a number of ways to avoid taking it. Double-jumping right before hitting the ground, grabbing a rope, falling in cobwebs or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">liquids,</a> opening an umbrella mid-fall, using a device to teleport back home while falling, and even using a grappling hook <em>down</em> and shooting one's self down <em>faster</em> are all valid ways to avoid taking a hit from landing. After entering Hardmode, equipping wings negates all fall damage for that character, even if they aren't used in a jump. A similar logic applies for the Featherfall Potion, which gets rid of fall damage while its buff is activated and slows fall speed. That makes sense, but the speed can be controlled and fall damage is still stopped even when falling at a "regular" speed with the buff on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series: Lara can grab onto ledges with one arm, but if she falls too far, she automatically dies no matter what she lands on and the grab action no longer works.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em>, where being launched into air by a spring-like mushroom, flying up about 2 kilometers and falling back down leaves you unharmed, with this also being the case with Von Boyage's cannon travel system, which sends the heroes to a different part of the world.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a></em> and <em>Turok 2</em>, falling for a certain amount of time causes Turok to enter a different falling animation. He dies as soon as he touches any solid ground while in this animation - even if you enter a cheat to fly, take him right over some solid ground, and deactivate to let him fall only half a foot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst">Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</a></em> plays this very straight. You can fall about 12 feet and never take damage. If there's a hazard or an even higher drop below you, though, you "panic-link" back to your Relto Age.
</li><li> This is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a>: Project Zoo</em>. A fall over a certain height will injure or even kill Gromit no matter what is done.
</li><li> Averted with the summoning stones introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>'s Burning Crusade, where if someone is falling off a cliff and is summoned to the dungeon, they hit the ground with all the force they should. This would require rather careful timing. When Wrath of the Lich King introduced a dungeon finder that allowed you to teleport to dungeons at will, they made the caveat that teleportation was not possible while falling.
<ul><li> Inverted in the Burning Crusade expansion as it's literally the fall that kills you. When you jump off the edge of any of the continents, you should fall forever in the Twisting Nether but at a certain point you will automatically die mid-fall.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, fall damage is quite lethal (except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a>), but a warrior (or druid in bear form) can use their Charge ability on an enemy, which causes them to rush up to that foe. However, the scripted movement for the Charge overrides the fact that they're currently falling, so they end up on the ground having suffered no damage. Also, casting Slow Fall or Levitate will instantly reduce a falling character's speed, to no ill effect, and they will suffer no damage when they hit the ground - regardless of how far they fell prior to that point.

It's hard to see, but she briefly uses air sorcery to slow her descent. That said, when she hits the ground she's in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.drowtales.com/mainarchive.php?order=chapters&amp;id=222">bad shape<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with internal bleeding (both from the fall and an earlier stab wound) and it's strongly suggested that if it wasn't for the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicHealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicHealer">Empathic Healer</a> Faen that she would have died.

Notably, she had tried to use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapeWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapeWings">hair</a> to slow the fall, but the pressure from her attacker shredded the "wings" before they could be properly formed.

Through the use of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">inertics</a>" to control inertia, even the most sudden of stops are made not only survivable but not even an inconvenience by spreading out the massive acceleration to the entire body at the same time.

Rainbow Dash accelerates to Mach 1, straight down, before catching her and making an instant 90-degree turn. This is approximately 1670 G's of force. Even better: three of the Wonderbolts had attempted to catch Rarity earlier in the fall, only to be knocked unconscious by Rarity's flailing hooves. Each of the stricken rescuers is at least a body lengths away from Rarity, in three different directions. Upon completion of the 90-degree turn, Rainbow Dash is seen to have the Wonderbolts on her back and carrying Rarity dangling from her front hooves. Rainbow Dash, therefore, performed a four-way catch in a vertical hypersonic power dive (with the three unconscious victims piled on her back but yet not getting in the way of her wings) and then performed the 90-degree turn. (A physics student with too much time on his hand also once calculated that the Sonic Rainboom does not indicate breaching Mach 1, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muVfidujxRg">Mach 5<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. True, she shattered the fabric of reality beforehand (and one could suppose the magic which is the only explanation for her flying at all can extend to her cargo), but this justification doesn't exist for these:

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, a shrunken Finn jumps out of a tree riding a squirrel to escape pursuers. Less than a second before they hit the ground, they land on a flying (parallel to the ground!) disc completely unharmed. Ah, but this is explained away easily. Size matters when you fall. Finn is clearly smaller than the squirrel. Their fall impacted the disc, but their combined weight and therefore force, would not be large at all.
</li><li> In the original 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">Transformers</a></em> series, Wheeljack (one of the few Autobots who can fly) is shot out of the air and is implied to be falling to his death. He's saved when Optimus Prime transforms into his truck form and allows Wheeljack to land on his trailer. Neither Wheeljack nor Prime's trailer got hurt.
<ul><li> Another scenario involved Silverbolt saving a group of human dignitaries from falling out of the sky by letting them land on his jet mode. Broken bones would be the <em>least</em> of their problems.
</li></ul></li><li> Going forward, one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> has Optimus, with Rattrap on his back, leap off a floating mountain (that was full of raw energon and was about to blow) and fall a few hundred feet into the jungle below. Optimus breaks the fall by grabbing onto a strong branch. In this case, the trope is played with: despite being a robot in disguise, such a stunt should have caused more damage to Optimus' arms and shoulders. Still, he explicitly states his arms felt "like refried rubber bands".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner">Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner</a></em>: Wile E. Coyote falls from high cliffs in his pursuit of the Road Runner every episode and is always just fine afterwards. He's also crashed into rocks and walls at speed (or had large objects crash into him at speed) with similar results.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, Peter Parker almost wrenches his arms out their sockets when he tries to web-swing while he's lost his powers. (Spidey's not particularly known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> in a world that has Iron Man and such, and all his villains are much stronger, forcing him to use his head, but the "proportional strength of a spider" proves to be something you'll miss <strong>very</strong> much when it's gone.)
</li><li> Lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Visionaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Visionaries">Visionaries</a></em> episode "Feryl Steps Out". Feryl has rescued Leoric from Darkstorm's dungeon, but, in order to get to the Dagger Assault and restore Leoric's Totem, the two of them must jump off a high ledge:
<div class="indent"><strong>Feryl</strong>: Long drop, isn't it? <br/><strong>Leoric</strong>: It isn't the drop, old friend, it's the landing!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>: Brock Samson gets this treatment a few times because he's just that badass.
<ul><li> One especially impressive example was lateral, rather than vertical. Up against Myra, who was in a car when Brock was on foot, he stood in the middle of the road facing away from her. As she prepared to run him down, he did breathing exercises and maneuvers that looked like tai chi, positioning his left arm straight out in front of him and his right arm out to his side. Thus he was perfectly positioned when she collided with him: He crushed her into the driver's seat and grasped the wheel with his left hand, while his right arm restrained Dr. Venture in the passenger seat when he hit the brakes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>: In "Stuck Up, Up and Away", Princess plummets from a dizzying height after her flying power armor is destroyed, but Blossom grabs her right before she hits the ground.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> when Spidey has lost his powers, so he has to rely on the elasticity of his webs to launch himself off walls. He complains it almost ripped his arm off.
<ul><li> Averted at every instance he has to rescue anyone from a fall, notably Mary Jane when she flung herself from a skyscraper to see if he'd save her.

<ul><li> The examples are the surprising Subversions of this trope; where extraordinarily lucky circumstances allowed something (or several somethings) to break the fall. The list of people who play it straight, so to speak, is much, much longer.

</li><li> Skydiver <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-435377/The-man-fell-12-000-ft---survived.html">Michael Holmes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> survived a 12,000 foot (3657 meters) fall when his parachute failed.
</li><li> Another skydiver, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/us/skydiver-no-parachute-successful-landing-trnd/index.html">Luke Aikins<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, recently went out of his way to subvert this trope, falling 25,000 feet <em>without a parachute</em> and surviving it unscathed. But in an extreme case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>, Aikins (a veteran skydiver) planned the whole stunt with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy Preparedness</a> and pulled it off with the supreme skill only someone of his caliber could achieve. Also, the double net that was his endpoint was specially designed to carefully decelerate him from 120mph to 0 at just the right rate so that his body could take it (and to do it, he had to turn around at the last second and land back-first).
</li><li> In 1971, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliane_Koepcke">Juliane Koepcke<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> not only survived a fall of approximately 3.2 kilometers after the aircraft she was on disintigrated in midair, but was able to walk afterwards and get herself to safety. (In her case, it probably helps that she came down still strapped into her seat and the two seats on either side of her were still attached to it, which probably helped to decelerate her descent and break her fall.) She was actually not the only passenger to survive the impact, but she was the only one who was ultimately found alive; all the rest, including Juliane's mother, died of their injuries before rescuers could locate them.
</li><li> Please note that after about 1,500 feet, a human in the most air-resistant position (spread eagle) will reach terminal velocity. The survivability of a fall decreases far less drastically once past this point.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in that you actually die from <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification">spaghettification<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> before hitting the singularity at the center.
<ul><li> Likewise, falling into a gas giant, a human would be crushed to death by the pressure long before hitting any sort of surface.
</li></ul></li><li> Dutch cyclist <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_van_Est">Wim van Est<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> fell into a 70-meter-deep ravine in the 1951 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a>. He survived the fall with no serious injuries thanks to the trees he fell into.
</li><li> The Peregrine Falcon doesn't hit the ground but can turn out of a stoop at such speed that it pulls Gs that would easily kill a human.
</li><li> Death by hanging when done properly plays this straight, when the sudden force of deceleration after a quick drop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManTheyCouldntHang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManTheyCouldntHang">(hopefully)</a> causes the noose to cleanly snap the neck. Long-drop hanging was invented precisely to ensure this, with the prisoner weighed beforehand to determine the length of rope necessary.
<ul><li> One odd case involved <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11225694/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/prisoner-once-found-too-fat-hang-dies/#.XuT5_kVKirc">an obese inmate in Washington State<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who argued that he couldn't be hanged (Washington's only execution method at the time) because it would constitute a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>. Because of his weight, the rope would either be so short he would die by strangulation, or too long so that his weight would cause his head to pop off his body.
</li></ul></li><li> Aversion in some instances as well; the shock and fear of falling can be enough to send someone into cardiac arrest, killing them or at least making them pass out before they hit ground.
</li><li> Modern parachutes are designed to open slowly, ensuring the integrity of both operator and parachute.
</li><li> A pair of skydivers from the US Army Golden Knights collided in mid-air while performing a "diamond track". One had his legs sliced off by the other's arm but survived, while the other was dead on arrival.
</li><li> This is part of the explanation of the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShticks">"Why can't they make a plane out of the black box material?"</a> joke, besides the obvious that it would be too heavy to flyâ€”even if the plane <em>was</em> indestructible, it would be of no help to the oh-so-breakable people inside of the plane when it crashes.
</li><li> This is why people who get in car accidents may still suffer various injuries despite being safely seatbelted inside the car. The force of suddenly decelerating from forty or fifty miles per hour (or faster) to zero in a few seconds can cause considerable damage. Mind, without the seatbelts, the issue becomes the car decelerating suddenly while the passenger does <em>not</em>, sending them flying through the windshield before being suddenly decelerated by the ground or another stationary object instead.
<ul><li> Also why cars nowadays seem much more fragile in crashes. This is by design â€” modern cars have crumple zones to absorb as much of the impact as possible in order to protect passengers from the impact forces. So a modern car is more likely to be totaled, but the humans inside are far likelier to live.
<ul><li> As alluded to by Jeremy Clarkson's quote, a sudden stop while driving cars at high speeds are <em>far</em> more fatal than the "spectacle" crashes, where the car flips multiple times. The latter allows the inertia to displace gradually (the risk here is the passenger area getting crushed; that's why enclosed race cars have roll cages). The former... not so much. That's what tragically happened to Dale Earnhardt. He was bumped and his car then crashed into the wall at 150mph. His body was well-restrained, but not his head, and while it didn't <em>look</em> violent, he basically experienced a lethal whiplash that broke his neck.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Helmets can protect your head from various traumas and are highly recommended for many activities because of it. That said, if the helmet is hit with enough force, the brain can still be damaged due to the force causing it to bounce around inside the skull. One well-studied occupation where this is an issue is soldiers (often subjected to explosions and other hazards). Another occupation where this is becoming acknowledged as a problem is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a> players (often subjected to other players running into them violently.)
<ul><li> In some sports (including American Football) certain improvements in protective gear are actually linked to <em>increased</em> injuries. Wearing what amounts to body armor allows you to shrug off impacts that would have seriously injured someone in a padded leather cap and a thick sweater, but it can only do so much, and the historical trend is for players to respond to better gear by doing more dangerous things. (In some cases the increase in injuries is seen in <em>opposing</em> players; the gear protects the player wearing it, allowing them to hit their opponent that much harder, often in a place that isn't protected as well.) New research into a condition called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy">Chronic traumatic encephalopathy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is lending credence to this unfortunate side effect. More hits to the head appear to seriously affect the brain over time.
<ul><li> A related problem is that because the short-term effects of these impacts were not as obvious or debilitating (they weren't losing consciousness or completely disoriented), players would be hit on the head and then return to the game a few plays later, compounding the injuries with additional hits. Increased awareness and tougher rules regarding clearing players to play after head injuries have finally begun to stem the tide of this; this was perhaps best exemplified in 2010, when a wide receiver famously <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81cf44cc/article/packers-wr-driver-was-very-concerned-about-rodgers-health">urged his quarterback<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to sit out the rest of the game after he sustained a concussion, telling him, "Your life is more important than this game."
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is the reason why, if you fall from a motorcycle and hit your head, you <em>do not</em> remove your helmet until you're told to do so or it is removed by the doctors. Modern full helmets keep your skull and neck tightly secured, allowing a potential lethal dislocation or fracture to not move until the doctors can see the damage.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReentryScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReentryScare">atmospheric re-entry</a>, if you enter at too steep an angle, the G-forces can kill the pilots, or the mission vehicle can burn up during its descent through the atmosphere. So in this case, the fall (back to Earth) does kill you; you might not even make it to the landing. This was the fate of the crew of the Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em>, which disintegrated upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere due to damaged thermal tiles.
<ul><li> This same principle is what sometimes causes incoming asteroids and comets to blow up in Earth's atmosphere.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> and deconstructed in response to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a> which described a baby being miraculously caught and saved after the mother, in desperation, threw the child from a "ninth or tenth story" window of the blazing Grenfell Tower. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41550836">At least one article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> noted that the story didn't add up because <em>the baby would still have fallen nine stories</em>; from that height, being caught by a person at ground level would be little if any improvement over falling to the ground. What's more, anyone catching a baby from that height would likely be seriously injured themselves.
